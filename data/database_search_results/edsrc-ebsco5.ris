AB  - In conventional digital game-based learning, geographic maps are generally used to provide students with the whole picture of the gaming contexts, while the concepts to be learned are separately presented as individual gaming objects. Scholars have indicated the problems of such a gaming content design, in which students could encounter difficulties making effective connections between spatial and conceptual knowledge during the learning process, which may influence their learning effectiveness. As a result, it is a crucial and challenging issue to assist students in organizing spatial and conceptual knowledge in contextual learning environments, such as digital games. To solve this problem, an integrated concept map and geographic map-based digital gaming (CM-GMDG) approach is proposed to demonstrate how spatial and conceptual knowledge can be connected in the development of digital games. To investigate the effectiveness of the approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a social science course. Two classes of seventh graders in a high school participated in this study. The experimental group (N = 39) adopted the CM-GMDG approach while the control group (N = 23) adopted the conventional geographic map-based digital gaming (GMDG) approach. The results showed that the students using the CM-GMDG approach significantly outperformed those using the GMDG approach on learning achievement. Moreover, the learning behavioral pattern analysis results showed that compared with the control group, students in the experimental group more frequently engaged in knowledge-acquiring behaviors, such as reading learning materials and completing learning tasks. On the other hand, the control group gave up on the learning tasks more frequently by switching the gaming scenes and stopping answering questions. This indicated that the CM-GMDG approach was more helpful for guiding students to focus on their learning tasks than the GMDG approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using a mixed methods design, this study examines graduate students' perceptions of attitudinal learning regarding the use of case-based learning (CBL) methods in an online instructional design course. One hundred and thirty-three students completed a survey taken from the Attitudinal Learning Inventory (ALI) in weeks three and seven of the eight-week course. Using Latent Profile Analysis (LPA), three classes of student types were identified: Skeptics who perceived low and declining attitudinal learning throughout the course, Adopters who perceived high and rising, and Advocates, who perceived very high and rising attitudes. Student reflection assignments on developing instructional design expertise using CBL, and a post-course questionnaire sent out five months after the course concluded were analyzed to gain further insights into student experiences and perspectives of both the course and CBL. Results indicated the majority of students perceived positive attitudinal learning throughout the course and had positive views of CBL as an instructional method. Students who struggled had less prior ID experience and seemed to exhibit a more negative perspective towards the course and CBL despite reporting less external challenges that impacted their learning in the course than the positive groups. Implications highlight the importance of facilitating SRL development and supplementing more novice CBL and ID students with additional support. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Integrated STEM activities are espoused as appropriate for enhancing student learning in relation to statistical concepts; however, a greater understanding of the way in which students' ideas about those concepts develop is needed to maximise the learning potential offered by engagement in STEM activities. For this study, plant growth was chosen as a topic from the Year 6 Australian Science Curriculum as an appropriate context to employ aspects of the four STEM disciplines to explore students' developing ideas about variation. Sixty-four Year 6 students across three school terms worked in groups of four to trial various treatments and their effects on the growth of radish or wheat seeds. This report considers two aspects of student learning related to this topic based on (i) the formative assessment of features of students' workbook entries specifically related to variation during the part of the classroom activity based on their TinkerPlots graphs and (ii) the later summative evidence of learning in responses to end-of-year questions on the activity for 56 of the students. The workbook entries are presented via a qualitative analysis to provide evidence of the forming of understanding of variation in a STEM context, with the SOLO Taxonomy being employed to assess the longer-term evidence and developmental nature of that learning. Overall, a broader picture has emerged of the potential for developing appreciation of variation in a STEM context in primary school. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to assess the impact of problem-based learning (PBL) on students' achievement in mechanical waves among secondary schools in South Western Uganda. Four hundred and nineteen students (419) from 19 schools were involved in this study. A quasi-experimental research method was employed through Solomon's four-group design. Form six physics students were randomly allocated to the experimental group exposed to PBL and the control group exposed to traditional instructional methods (TIM). A Mechanical Wave Conceptual Survey (MWCS) was administered twice as a pre- and post-test to both groups. Exposition to these instructions lasted three and half months. The study found that students' achievements in waves improved in the PBL than in the TIM learning environment, supported by the large effect size and high learning gains in the experimental group than those in the control group. Specifically, among groups offered both pre- and post-test during Solomon's four-group sampling at the post-test stage, the experimental group achieved higher than the control group. Further analysis among factors such as gender difference, age difference, subjects' combination, single girls alongside mixed schools, and government or private owned schools were analyzed, and practical implications such as teacher's adaptation of PBL were recommended.

AB  - This study addresses suggestions for analyzing science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) components and their interactions and these suggestions are expected to facilitate the analysis of science teachers' PCK, resulting in more accurate representations of PCK. Knowledge of the science curriculum, knowledge of students' understanding of science, knowledge of assessment in science, and knowledge of instructional strategies were used as specific PCK components in this study and the PCK mapping approach was used as the theoretical framework. Suggestions for PCK components' analysis are based on the similarity among PCK components and the similarity between PCK components and other knowledge domains. Furthermore, suggestions for the analysis of interaction among PCK components are related to the direction of interaction, the strength of one interaction considering its content, and categorizing the number of interactions between PCK components. These suggestions can provide new insights into the analysis of PCK components and their interactions for researchers and improve the precision and heuristic power of PCK models.

AB  - Curriculum standards are a critical component of a nation's educational system and directly impact talent development and overall national development. Most studies on curriculum standards focus on a single competency. This study aims to understand the extent to which the competencies outlined in the OECD 2030-oriented learning framework are reflected in China's compulsory education biology curriculum as a whole and within individual content subjects. In this study, we conducted a content analysis of China's National Biology Curriculum Standards (Grades 7–9). The result shows that the standards cover 20 of the 28 competencies, focusing on foundational literacies, transformative competencies and competency development. We found that certain competencies, such as Action, Literacy, and Problem-solving, were emphasized across content subjects, while other competencies were uniquely emphasized within specific content subjects. This study provides a comprehensive view of China's National Biology Curriculum Standards (Grades 7–9) from the perspective of future literacy development and can inform efforts to reform the curriculum.

AB  - Both learner-generated drawing and retrieval practice methods are effective to enhance science learning. To compare the impact of combining different drawing methods (representational drawing vs. abstract drawing) with retrieval practice on the carbon cycle learning, 136 Chinese high school students enrolled in a geography course were assigned randomly to six learning conditions: students built their mental models of the carbon cycle by either generating sketches with or without access to the text learning material introducing the carbon cycle (i.e., generative sketching vs. retrieval sketching), or by creating concept maps with or without access to the learning material (i.e., generative concept mapping vs. retrieval concept mapping), or students just freely recalled on what they have learned from the learning material by paragraphing (i.e., retrieval practice), or restudied the learning material with note-taking (i.e., restudy). Students' learning outcomes were assessed by immediate and one-week delayed tests. Results revealed that no difference was found between the six conditions on the immediate test, whereas students in the retrieval practice condition with paragraphing significantly outperformed those who did not practice retrieval on the one-week delayed test. However, there was no difference between the two drawing conditions regardless of whether they were adopted with or without retrieval practice. Furthermore, the same pattern was found on the factual knowledge questions in both tests, but no main effect of condition was found on both the immediate and the delayed tests for the application questions. We conclude that retrieval-based drawing could be adopted for climate change education at the high school level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

By utilizing digital storytelling projects to showcase course competencies in an undergraduate biology course, students were able to apply subject matter outside the classroom. In this post hoc analysis of pretest and posttest scores from a two-year Florida college, significant results with medium effect sizes were shown for classes engaged in digital storytelling projects. It was determined that age was not a significant factor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although much research exists of students' alternative conceptions about evolution and natural selection, the way in which these vary in time and how scientific explanations change during instruction remains to be described and understood. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to characterise the nature of the change in student thinking about evolution through the mechanism of natural selection during a six-lesson intervention with a group of ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from a private subsidised school in Chile. The study group included thirteen students to whom a pre- and post-test was applied using the questionnaire Assessment of Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORNS), and from whom short tasks were collected at the end of three lessons. The data were analysed using a quantitative and qualitative analysis of nine students grouped in five cases of study. The main patterns described here are the recurrence of the design teleology thinking in students, the initial use of key concepts such as mutation, survival, and differential reproduction during the trajectories, the abundance of mixed thinking during and at the end of the instruction, and the low coherence in the structure of thinking, both in time and through the different contexts analysed.

AB  - This study explores the effect of mobile-assisted task-based learning (M-TBL) on vocabulary achievement and student attitude among English as a in content and language integrated learning (CLIL) science lessons, the researcher focused on foreign language (FL) students. To investigate this, a quasi-experimental research design was utilized. In the first semester of the 2022–2023 academic year, 34 fourth-grade students from a private school in Istanbul took part in the study. During the course of 6 weeks, the experimental group engaged in six different M-TBL activities and were assigned a one-page worksheet as homework, while the control group completed only the one-page worksheet. Quantitative data for the study were collected through vocabulary achievement tests and a student attitude questionnaire. The data underwent analysis through paired sample t-tests and descriptive analyses. The results indicated a significant difference in vocabulary achievement between the experimental and control groups, and they also revealed a positive impact on student attitudes, igniting their interest in learning the target language. In light of these findings, it can be concluded that mobile-assisted task-based activities yield positive effects on both vocabulary achievement and student attitude in primary FL learners participating in CLIL science lessons.

AB  - Evolution by natural selection and adaptation are core concepts in biology that students must see and correctly understand their meaning. However, using these concepts in evidence-based learning strategies in the classroom is a difficult task. Here, we present a 5E lesson plan to address the Next Generation Science Standards performance expectation HS-LS4-4, to "construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations." The Functional Frogs lesson provides multiple hands-on activities to engage students in the development of hypotheses, collection and analysis of empirical data on frog swimming, presentation of results, and construction of explanations supported by evidence for the results. The lesson's central idea is for students to understand the trait values that provide an advantage in the aquatic environment, increasing a frog's survival. The link between morphological changes and survival is used to explain how natural selection acts on populations, leading to adaptive evolution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article presents a SoTL study of students' use of concept maps in my undergraduate class "Women in Christian History," in a mid-semester module called "the Eve project." I present three students' maps to show the different kinds of understandings that students developed in this literacy encounter. I am especially interested in how I can read these learning artifacts as a humanities scholar, and I use humanities theory—in this case, new materialism—to understand aspects of my students' map-making, with a focus on the keyword "work." I argue that the maps in my study, read through a new materialist lens, functioned as working objects in a manner that encouraged "differenciation" (inviting students to move toward multiple undefined learning outcomes), and that this is quite different from the work of "differentiation" (ranking students according to predefined learning outcomes) that concept maps traditionally perform in science classes.

AB  - The study aimed to examine the influence of ChatGPT on the academic performance and learning perception of eleventh-grade students in a United Arab Emirates school in the field of electronic magnetism. The participants were randomly divided into two groups: an experimental group granted access to ChatGPT and a control group without access to ChatGPT. The research spanned four weeks, during which the experimental group was instructed to utilize ChatGPT whenever they required assistance with the course content. The study employed a mixed-methods design, collecting both quantitative and qualitative data to assess the impact of ChatGPT on student learning and perception. Quantitative data was gathered through pre-/post-test surveys, measuring participants' course achievement and perception of learning with ChatGPT. Qualitative data was collected via open-ended survey questions, allowing participants to provide feedback and suggestions for improvement. The study revealed that ChatGPT had a positive influence on student achievement and perception of learning in the field of electronic magnetism. The experimental group displayed significant enhancements in their scores on the post-test measuring the impact of ChatGPT on student achievement, exhibiting higher mean scores across all subscales compared to the control group. Furthermore, both male and female participants acknowledged ChatGPT as a valuable learning tool, offering suggestions for enhancing its functionality. The study suggests that ChatGPT is an effective tool for enhancing student learning and achievement in specific academic domains. However, further research is needed to explore its generalizability to other contexts and disciplines, as well as to address potential challenges and limitations of ChatGPT use in education.

AB  - Complex thinking is a desired competency in 21st-century university students, so technology-based teaching and learning strategies must be carefully considered when training them in complex reasoning skills. This systematic review aims to map research on the use of teaching and learning strategies supported by technology to enhance complex thinking skills in university students. This review reports results according to PRISMA (preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses) guidelines. The search strategy was performed in June 2022 in Scopus and Web of Science databases. Of 151 records initially identified between 2018 and 2022, 32 papers were included in the final synthesis per the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The results of this review indicate that (1) tech-based strategies for complex thinking development are based on active learning approaches including problem-based learning, case-based learning, collaboration-driven and discussion-based learning, project-based learning, assessment- and feedback-oriented activities, and mind mapping techniques; (2) most of the documented strategies were implemented in hybrid contexts; (3) traditional instructional materials commonly used for promoting higher order thinking skills such as reading assignments, videos, and eliciting/reflexive questions are still effective in fostering complex thinking when delivered through technology; and (4) custom-built technological development for complex thinking development software that incorporates emerging technologies is scarce at present. Further research is needed to document the interventions that train students interactively in complex thinking skills using Education 4.0 technologies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Chemical engineers frequently contribute to the advancement of the medical field; however, medical applications are often only covered in elective courses. To introduce medical applications into the core curriculum, we implemented a hands-on learning tool that portrays blood separation principles through microbead settling in a core third-year chemical engineering separations class. Test scores from twenty-six students show significant growth at p < 0.001 from Pretest to Posttest I at average values of 41 % and 68 %, respectively. Posttest II scores reveal a significantly higher average score of 84 % for students who sat through lecture before the hands-on experiment in comparison to 75 % for students who first had the hands-on experiment then lecture with statistical significance of p = 0.046 and a moderate Cohen's d effect size of 0.442. Students report positive, lasting impressions from the guided-learning worksheet and hands-on learning experience on their feedback surveys and one-on-one interviews. Retention assessments from four students six months post-intervention reveal retention of concepts with an average test score of 74 %. These outcomes suggest hands-on learning tools are most impactful on conceptual and motivational gains when supplemented with pre-experiment lectures and quality complementary learning materials. A hands-on learning tool containing microbeads suspended in fluid shows blood separation principles and results in significant learning gains in a core chemical engineering separations class. [Display omitted] • Microbeads suspended in fluid are effective in portraying blood separation principles for educational purposes. • Students who experience lecture before the hands-on experiment significantly outperform students who had lecture afterward. • Retention assessments reveal conceptual understanding is maintained six months post-intervention. • Exposure to an interdisciplinary learning tool expanded self-perceived career opportunities for third-year students.

AB  - There is an increasing need for innovative educational methods that can motivate and engage students in subjects that are often perceived as difficult or boring. One such approach is the UPCT-Bloopbusters educational project, developed by a group of professors at the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain, wherein concepts from the fields of physics and technology are presented and exemplified in the classroom through scenes from different movies in conjunction with experiments. The project was conducted on three subjects, one from each of the three bachelor of electrical engineering degree programs offered at the UPCT, namely Physics I, Applied Physics, and Optical Communications. This paper describes the methodology of the educational project and then presents and discusses the academic results of the students involved in terms of success and performance rates both before and after the application of the new methodology. Moreover, the results of a survey carried out on the students are presented. Finally, some of the exercises used in this methodology for the teaching and learning of science based on different movie scenes are provided as examples. The results of the project show that the students were receptive of the methodology and further indicated that it may lead to increased academic performance due to their enhanced understanding of physics and technology concepts.

AB  - Physics education has been identified as one of the public sectors that are mostly influenced by technological developments. This paper adopted the quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design to assess the effects of multimedia-aided technologies (MAT) on undergraduate students' performance in quantum physics (QP) at the University of Rwanda College of Education (UR-CE). The researcher used purposive sampling to get 385 undergraduate students. Participants were randomly allocated into experimental (group A) and control (group B) groups. Group A (187 students) students were taught selected topics of quantum physics (blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, Compton effect, wave aspects of particles, De Broglie's hypothesis, diffraction, interference and double-slit experiment, model of the atom, uncertainty relations, wave function, and Schrodinger equations) for 6 weeks using multimedia-aided technologies and engage, predict, observe, and explain (EPOE) method, whereas group B (187 students) was taught same topics during the same period with a lecture method. The results of ANCOVA revealed that the group's performance was the same (p >.05) before learning with no effect size (.000), while they diverged after learning with different teaching interventions. The significance was very high and statistically different (p <.001) with a large effect size (>.5). This implies that students taught with multimedia-aided technologies (experimental group) outperformed those students taught with lecture teaching methods (control group). Thus, the study recommends that educators should adapt teaching using MAT and EPOE strategy not only in QP but also in other domains of physics to improve active engagement, understanding levels, and academic achievement.

AB  - Student perceptions toward homework assigned in general chemistry courses was investigated in this study. The study participants were required to complete homework assignments using two different online systems, ALEKS (adaptive-responsive system) and Sapling (traditional-responsive system). An online survey investigating their general perceptions of homework was administered at the beginning of the semester, and after the participants had completed most of the course, another survey was administered toward the end of the semester exploring their perceptions of both homework systems used in the course. We found that most students believed homework was important to their performance in the course. Our results also showed that students' prior experience in high school science classes had an impact on their perceptions of the amount and the frequency of homework they expected in their general chemistry course. In general, students perceived ALEKS to be a more effective tool for preparing exams, however they also complained that the system was more time-consuming compared to Sapling. For CHEM 1, we did not see a significant change in students' performance based on their homework system preference. In conclusion, students believed homework was a tool to help them learn the subject matter better, and they generally had positive perceptions toward both online homework systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how pre- and in-service teachers (N = 346) evaluate different learning strategies for six scenarios, and how they justify their answers. Results showed that teachers mostly evaluate strategies found to be effective in previous empirical studies as more effective and they can provide proper scientific justifications, though some justifications included misconceptions. Teachers were most confused when comparing interleaving versus blocking and retrieval versus concept mapping. Configural frequency analysis showed that justifications were generally, but not always, consistent with evaluations. These findings refer to the importance of examining teacher knowledge both with evaluations and with open-end questions. Misconceptions identified by justifications comprise useful information for planning teacher-training courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Educational theories guide nursing curricula and pathophysiology instruction. • Gestalt, critical, and humanistic theories support students' clinical skills. • These theories promote conceptual learning, innovation, empathy, and reform. We propose using three theories to develop pathophysiology courses. Gestalt theory supports students' abilities to integrate information holistically. Critical Pedagogy shows students how to recognize biases and inequalities, critique scientific information, and lead future health care reforms. Humanism encourages the development of empathy and interpersonal skills. Our paper describes the philosophical underpinnings of these theoretical perspectives, examines the relevance to nursing education, provides a sample pathophysiology course outline, and gives recommendations for future programs.

AB  - Core concepts in physiology, designed by physiology educators to promote improved learning and teaching, have existed for over a decade. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which a set of 15 core concepts of physiology (developed by Michael and McFarland, U.S.-based educators) are reflected in the learning outcomes (LOs) of units (subjects) comprising physiology curricula in Australian universities. From publicly accessible online information, we identified 17 Australian universities that offered a physiology major for undergraduate degree students and downloaded 788 LOs from the 166 units that comprised the majors. Each LO was blindly mapped against the 15 core concepts by 8 physiology educators from 3 Australian universities. Additionally, text-matching software was employed to match keywords and phrases (identified as descriptors of the 15 core concepts) against the LOs. The frequency of individual words and two-word phrases for each core concept was calculated and ranked. There was variability in rating LOs for the same university among academic mappers; nevertheless, many of the 15 core concepts did not appear to be adequately covered in the LOs. Two core concepts most matched manually were in the top three most mapped by the software. These were, from most common, structure/function and interdependence. Our findings suggest a lack of alignment of LOs with the core concepts across Australian physiology curricula. This highlights the need for Australiawide agreement on a set of core concepts in physiology as the first step in collaboratively improving assessment and learning and teaching practice in physiology. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first time an existing set of core concepts for physiology, developed by Michael and McFarland (U.S.-based educators), have been mapped against unit (subject) learning outcomes across physiology curricula in Australian universities to gauge uptake and the need for agreement on a set of core concepts in the Australian higher education context.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to observe the relationship between students' cognitive abilities and their performance in organic chemistry. We were interested in measuring whether some cognitive composites were more predictive than others on organic chemistry performance, whether group differences existed between males and females, and whether group differences existed between students with above and below average cognitive abilities. For Study 1 and Study 2, our participants included 48 and 60 sophomore organic chemistry students respectively. We used the Woodcock-Johnson Test of Cognitive Abilities-IV to measure cognitive composites. ACS organic chemistry exam scores and scores on an organic chemistry concept inventory were used to measure student performance. We ran a correlational analysis between the cognitive composites and organic chemistry scores, and t-tests for group comparisons. For Study 1, we found a significant moderate correlation between long-term retrieval and organic chemistry scores. For Study 2, we found a significant small to moderate correlation between comprehension knowledge and short-term working memory, with organic chemistry scores. We did not find any significant gender differences, except on comprehension knowledge. The differences between above average and below average cognitive abilities were only seen in relation to the concept inventory and not ACS exam scores. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The southernmost Thailand insurgency has increased violence since the early 2000s. It is a cause of learning loss and psychological stress among students, primarily Muslims. Having been exposed to unrest for a long time, students lack confidence and lose interest in learning many subjects, including physics. Culturally responsive teaching can provide a solution by searching for and using funds of knowledge embodied in physics concepts to facilitate meaningful learning and to build pride in their cultural identity. The present study aims to search for funds of knowledge that embody physics concepts to exemplify culturally responsive physics education. The study employs ethnography in which provincial culturalists and a curator of a local museum were interviewed in-depth, and the researcher immersed in and conducted observations of the creation of Bulan kites with local experts for an extended period of time. Meanings in the qualitative data were discerned using narrative analysis. The results indicate three assertions, as follows: (1) There are cultural artifacts in the southernmost provinces of Thailand that have the potential to be used in physics education. (2) The outsiders' appreciation of cultural artifacts causes the local community and students to begin to value their own funds of knowledge. (3) Unrest has caused misunderstandings among non-Muslim Thais, which can be resolved using cultural artifacts and the stories behind them. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A deep understanding of the learning level of online learners is a critical factor in promoting the success of online learning. Using knowledge structures as a way to understand learning can help analyze online students' learning levels. The study used concept maps and clustering analysis to investigate online learners' knowledge structures in a flipped classroom's online learning environment. Concept maps (n = 359) constructed by 36 students during one semester (11 weeks) through the online learning platform were collected as analysis objects of learners' knowledge structures. Clustering analysis was used to identify online learners' knowledge structure patterns and learner types, and a non-parametric test was used to analyze the differences in learning achievement among learner types. The results showed that (1) there were three online learners' knowledge structure patterns of increasing complexity, namely, spoke, small-network, and large-network patterns. Moreover, online learners with novice status mostly had spoke patterns in the context of flipped classrooms' online learning. (2) Two types of online learners were found to have different distributions of knowledge structure patterns, and the complex knowledge structure type of learners exhibited better learning achievement. The study explored a new way for educators to analyze knowledge structures by data mining automatically. The findings provide evidence in the online learning context for the relationship between complex knowledge structures and better learning achievement while suggesting the existence of inadequate knowledge preparedness for flipped classroom learners without a special instructional design.

Here, we propose a COVID-19 roadmap consisting of four commented maps about infection, diagnosis, defense, treatment, and prevention. We built the maps based on those from the Atlas of Science Literacy following a qualitative methodology. Main ideas about health linked to COVID-19 and how they relate to each other can be visualized in the maps in an organized structure and according to K-levels. The maps are accompanied by a text that relates the health ideas to the COVID-19 disease.

AB  - Underpinned by the accelerated progression of information technology, the role of educational big data in information gathering and analysis has been underscored, particularly so in finance, a discipline embedded in logic and analysis. Patterns in student learning and behavioral data, when examined, can afford educators invaluable insights to shape efficacious teaching strategies. Contemporary research probing into the dynamics of student learning preference evolution and cognitive advancement appears to over-depend on static data, often falling short of effectively addressing the intricate data structures in educational big data. In this light, it becomes imperative to delve into the temporal shifts in student learning preferences and their link to cognitive advancement. In this context, a novel dynamic trustaware preference evolution model is brought to the fore, with the potential to precisely track variations in learning preferences of finance students and elucidate their correlation with cognitive advancement. A correlation model is erected, laying bare the reciprocal interaction between the metamorphosis of student learning preferences and cognitive progression. This pioneering approach eclipses the constraints inherent in extant research methodologies, rendering deeper comprehension to educators. Findings from regression analysis divulge the association between the transformative journey of learning preferences and cognitive advancement, holding far-reaching implications for educational practices. These revelations can capacitate educators to fine-tune their teaching approaches in line with student development, fostering personalized learning ecosystems. This research further holds significant merits for addressing complexities within finance education, aiding in the cultivation of adept professionals capable of navigating the fluid landscape of modern finance.

AB  - The urgent shift to online distance teaching and learning during the Covid-19 pandemic presented teachers with unique pedagogical, technological, and psychological challenges. The aim of this study was to map the main positive and negative experiences of teachers during this transition, as well as to examine intra- and interpersonal factors that affected teachers' ability to cope effectively with the challenges of online distance teaching. We used a mixed-method approach that combined qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires) analyses. The interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory approach, specifically a bottom-up analysis, which led to the identification of five primary categories reflecting teachers' main concerns in online distance teaching (i.e., social, emotional, cognitive, pedagogical, and system support. The two most prominent categories were pedagogy and emotions, illustrating their centrality in teachers' experiences. A regression analysis of the questionnaires' data revealed that the two main variables which predicted both positive and negative experiences in online distance teaching were self-efficacy and teachers' attitudes towards technology integration in teaching. Findings of this study allow formulation of guidelines to promote factors related to positive experiences in online distance teaching. • Mixed-method study of teachers' experiences in online distance teaching during Covid-19. • Five categories describe main experiences: pedagogy, emotion, social, cognitive, support. • Self-efficacy predicts teachers' positive and negative experiences in distance teaching. • Attitudes towards technology predicts only positive experiences in distance teaching. • Support, openness to change and individual differences did not predict experiences.

AB  - Collaborative knowledge construction (CKC) involved students' sharing of information, improvement of ideas, and construction of collective knowledge. In this process, knowledge extraction and analysis can provide valuable insights into students' knowledge capacities, depths, and levels in order to improve the CKC quality. However, existing studies tended to extract and analyze knowledge from a single perspective (e.g., the number of certain knowledge types and knowledge structures), which failed to demonstrate the complexity and dynamics of knowledge construction and advancement. To fill this gap, this research designed a series of computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) activities to facilitate students' CKC process and then used an integrated approach (i.e., semantic knowledge analysis combined with learning analytics) to extract, analyze, and understand students' knowledge characteristics and evolutionary trends. Results demonstrated that compared to the low-performing pairs, the high-performing pairs mainly discussed knowledge related to the course content, and their knowledge evolution trend was relatively stable. Based on the results, this research provided analytical implications to extract, analyze, and understand students' knowledge and pedagogical implications to promote students' knowledge construction and advancement.

AB  - Asking good questions is vital for scientific learning and discovery, but improving this complex skill is a formidable challenge. Here, we show in two experiments (N = 152) that teaching others—learning-by-teaching—enhances one's ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge, relative to two other well-established generative learning techniques: retrieval practice and concept-mapping. Learners who taught scientific expository texts across natural and social sciences topics by delivering video-recorded lectures outperformed their peers who practiced retrieval or constructed concept maps when tested on their ability to generate create-level research questions based on the texts (Experiment 1). This advantage held reliably even on a delayed test 48 hr later, and when all learners similarly received and responded to poststudy questions on the material (Experiment 2). Moreover, across both immediate and delayed tests, learning-by-teaching produced a recall benefit that rivaled that of the potent technique of retrieval practice. In contrast, despite recalling more than twice the study content that the concept-mapping group did, learners who practiced retrieval were unable to generate more create-level research questions based on that content. Three supplemental experiments (N = 168) further showed that retrieval practice consistently did not improve higher-order question generation over restudying, despite yielding superior long-term retention. Altogether, these findings reveal that simply possessing a wealth of factual knowledge is insufficient for generating higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Rather, teaching others is a powerful strategy for producing deep and durable learning that enables research question generation. To ask better questions, teach. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Scientific discovery often begins with the art of asking good questions. Here, we show that teaching others enhances students' ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Across immediate and delayed tests, students who taught scientific material by delivering a video-recorded lecture successfully generated more create-level research questions based on the material, as compared to their peers who used well-established learning methods such as retrieval practice and concept-mapping. While we teach, we learn to ask better research questions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science educators highlight the importance of developing systems thinking (ST) and futures thinking (FT) for students to make decisions and to be active citizens that address socioscientific problems. The dimensions related to FT take in this study were three implied in ST and two in the appropriation of the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the level of FT-related dimensions developed by a group of pre-service elementary teachers and how far different activities designed to foster them were effective. Written explanations presented by the participants about the origin of pandemics and possible ways to prevent them, as well as videos developed by small groups with the goal to present a campaign for avoiding future pandemics, were analysed. Based on the literature, five dimensions and up to four levels of performances were identified. After completing the activities, participants were able to relate the three spheres of the "One Health" notion to explain the causes of pandemics. Moreover, they established complex cause-effect relationships between the different factors, although they only constructed monocausal relationships when proposing measures. Participants improved their performance in anticipating the future and identifying themselves as agents of change. The elaboration of concept maps facilitated the development of components and behaviour ST dimensions, and the design of the campaign allowed participants to identify themselves as agents of change. The use of these strategies in science education can contribute to the development of a citizenry capable of understanding and acting on systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Geoinformation systems, as teaching tools in education, are closely linked to interdisciplinary and natural sciences. Currently, the application of geoinformation systems (GIS) in the educational process holds great potential for higher education. This paper presents a pedagogical system for teaching and learning a GIS course, along with a wide range of information sources that educators can choose from. The pedagogical system of introducing special GIS courses is divided into content, organizational and methodological structures. The theoretical and practical foundations of the introduction of special GIS courses are also considered. Additionally, the paper provides information about practical works setting up and implementing ArcGIS to work with maps and geospatial data with Python. The pedagogical system described in this paper was employed in the educational process of the L.N. Gumilyov Eurasian National University (Astana, Kazakhstan) and K. Zhubanov Aktobe Regional University (Aktobe, Kazakhstan). This experimental research examines how perceptions of geocapabilities evolved among 119 higher education students as they acquired technical skills in web mapping by investigating real-world issues with ArcGIS.

AB  - With the development of science and technology, the demand for programmers has increased. However, learning computer programs is not an easy task. It might cause a significant impact on programming if misconceptions exist at the beginning of the study. Hence, it is important to discover and correct them immediately. Chatbots are effective teaching aids, they can assist students in eliminating misconceptions. They also assist teachers to instruct students according to their aptitude, which teachers found it hard to accomplish without technical supports when teaching in large classes. Therefore, this experiment uses chatbots to assist learners in the correction phase. We consider that learners who failed unit quizzes might have misunderstandings in programming concepts. We believe chatbots can teach according to individual misunderstandings and give correct responses to their unclear concepts. It is more effective than traditional teaching methods. In addition, to prevent human-computer interaction barriers, such as picking wrong keywords and giving plausible replies, or learners not being able to express their problems clearly, this experiment also adds concept maps to the chatbots' dialogue, to work as the dialogue structure for each chatbot. The maps help the chatbots to explain concepts in each unit systematically and logically. The chatbots give questions according to the concepts on the concept maps and ask learners to reply with their answers. An ANCOVA test investigated students' scores. Result showed the p-value is below 0.001, indicating that the group using concept map chatbots has better correction effects than the other group using only concept maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Lectures containing information presented in verbal and visual form are widely used in educational settings. To date, little is known about how the visual display in a video lecture influences immediate and delayed recall. In two experiments, participants listened to a pre-recorded lecture while viewing an animated concept map, sequential listing of bulleted text, or there was no visual display. Results indicated that the concept map lecture enhanced immediate recall accuracy; however, the type of ideas recalled is also important to consider. Compared to the listen-only lecture, the concept map and bulleted text lectures promoted more recall of main ideas rather than details. Finally, the concept map lecture mainly benefitted those with high prior science achievement. These findings suggest that the visual display in a video lecture may affect the type of ideas remembered, and prior knowledge should be considered when choosing how to present information in a video lecture.

AB  - Measuring the factors affecting the implementation process is critical for understanding how, why, and under what circumstances integrated STEM curriculum innovations work. The overarching goal of this National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project was to design, field-test, implement, and evaluate contextualized integrated STEM learning experiences that use agricultural life sciences (AgS) as a context. To that end, we developed AgS model-eliciting activities (MEAs). MEAs are thought-revealing tasks that require student teams to mathematize real-world situations. The present study employed the iterative engineering design process guided by the innovation implementation framework to identify essential structural and interactional integrated STEM curriculum implementation components. Common Core State Standards (CCSS), teacher scopes and sequence plans, student readability level, agricultural life science contexts, culturally relevant pedagogy, and access to STEM mentors were mapped to the AgS MEA curriculum implementations. Drawing on semi-structured teacher interviews (individual and focus group), recorded teacher development sessions, and documented expert consultations, this study provides research-to-practice findings that support the effective implementation of an innovative integrated STEM curriculum for elementary grade levels. An iterative engineering design process guided by the innovation implementation framework provided a strategic iterative method to utilize teacher feedback over five AgS MEA implementations. Six structural and six interactive AgS MEA implementation components were identified. The results from this work can help mitigate the barriers researchers and teachers experience when implementing integrated STEM curriculum innovations. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper describes a concept mapping teaching exercise that was implemented in different stages at both the graduate and undergraduate level. First, a small group of graduate students worked to construct a concept map that illustrated the connections between published work as they prepared to take their qualifying examinations. A similar assignment—visually depicting connections between course readings—was implemented between the midterm and final exam in a large-section online undergraduate course. In the undergraduate course, there was noticeable improvement between midterm and final essay responses in which students compared and contrasted readings, and students reported perceptions of it as a valuable exercise. Structured interviews with both undergraduate and graduate students further confirm that concept mapping can improve learning outcomes at both levels of instruction. The project reveals important differences in the way that both sets of students approach relational exercises involving readings and suggests ways of using concept mapping to enhance students' retention of the material.

AB  - The present study aimed at the effect of concept mapping strategies on learners' achievement and retention in biology teaching. A pretest/posttest quasi-experimental research design was adopted with one control and experimental group. The target population was male students who studied in second grade of high school in 2023-22 educational year in Iran. Simple random sampling technique was used to select the sample of students. Considering the Cohen tables and statistical assumptions, a sample size of 40 participants was estimated. They were then randomly assigned to each group. The experimental group made use of concept mapping strategies, while the control group was taught using the traditional methods. An academic achievement teacher made test was administered to all groups as a pretest / posttest and biology achievement retention teacher made test, a separate delayed posttest was administered after three weeks to the learners of the groups. The obtained data were analyzed using one-way Ancova test. The results indicated that concept mapping strategies had a significant effect on learners' achievement. Analysis of the data using t-tests revealed that the retention of biology teaching by using concept mapping strategies was significantly higher in comparison to the traditional methods.

AB  - A large number of chemistry students drop out of their studies, often because of high requirements for content knowledge. Quantum chemical models of atomic bonding such as molecular orbital (MO) theory are particularly challenging. We aimed to develop an intervention on MO theory based on the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning framework. First, students work independently with interactive learning videos. Then, they create concept maps about core concepts of MO theory. In this paper, we present the evaluation of this intervention in terms of content knowledge, considering person-specific characteristics. Additionally, we compare three different treatment groups with varying materials and group arrangements, and prospective chemistry teachers with other first-year students. Our results show that students can answer single-choice questions well with the prior knowledge from their first-year chemistry course. Answering open-ended questions is more difficult. Nevertheless, they can improve significantly in both categories by working with the learning videos; creating concept maps does not lead to significant content knowledge changes. There are also no significant differences between the three treatment groups, or between teacher students and other chemistry freshmen. Regarding prior knowledge, differences depending on gender and school-leaving grades can be measured, whereas the choice of courses in school has no effect. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Situating learners in a context relevant to scientific phenomena enables them to acquire knowledge through experience, reflection, conceptualization, and practice, which is an important learning mode in science education. However, learners generally do not have opportunities to experience many scientific phenomena in the real world. Therefore, virtual learning environments (VLE) are becoming a frequently adopted technology to provide authentic learning contexts. In particular, spherical video-based learning environments (SVLE), which are a low-tech form of VLE, have attracted the attention of school teachers and educational technology researchers. Additionally, effective assessment methods, such as the two-tier-test, have been adopted to examine learners' performance during the virtual learning process. On the other hand, researchers have pointed out that lack of effective learning strategies may decrease the learning effects in a virtual learning context. Hence, this study integrated a graphic organizer into a two-tier test-based learning mode, in which the first-tier questions were declarative items with a short answer (e.g., the questions of where, what, and when), whereas the second-tier questions were more in-depth, deeper causal-type questions (e.g., the questions of why and how), in the contexts of SVLE. To verify the effectiveness of this learning approach, a graphic organizer-based two-tier test SVLE was developed; moreover, a quasi-experimental design was conducted in the "Mysteries of the Earth" unit of the sixth graders' natural science course. A total of 41 sixth graders from two classes, with an average age of 12, were recruited in this experiment. One class was assigned to be the experimental group adopting the graphic organizer-based two-tier test SVLE (GT-SVLE), while the other was the control group adopting the conventional two-tier test-based SVLE (CT-SVLE). All of the students learned with the SVLE using tablet computers. Based on the results, the GT-SVLE could better improve students' learning achievement than the CT-SVLE. Besides, according to behavioral analysis and interviews, the control group had significantly more learning behaviors of repeated reading of supplementary materials and repeated wrong answers, indicating that the proposed approach facilitated students' positive behaviors through observation and knowledge construction in SVLE, which helped them achieve the learning objectives. • A spherical video-based learning environments (SVLE) learning approach is proposed. • The approach advanced students' positive behaviors through observation and knowledge. • The approach was conducted with two-tier test strategy. • The study was conducted in the unit of the sixth graders' natural science course. • The study used concept map as a tool for researching.

AB  - This research evaluated the effect of guided inquiry approach-based laboratory activity within the scope of lifelong learning, in which daily life context is used, on developing pre-service science teachers' learning processes. The study groups for the research consisted of six pre-service science teachers who were seniors in the science education department at a university in the west of Turkey. The holistic single-case design was used as the research method in this study. One of the topics related to enzymes we encounter in many areas of daily life is the concept of enzymatic browning. In this study, starting from a daily life context, an activity that includes the chemical change emphasis underlying the enzymatic browning event and the factors affecting the work of enzymes is discussed. In this context, the guided inquiry learning approach, in which the hypothetico-deductive reasoning cycle is used in laboratory practices in teacher education, is based on the activity. At the end of the activity, experiment reports, science journals, and concept maps were evaluated. As a result of the evaluation, it was seen that the students not only designed scientific research and tested their hypotheses consistently and accurately but also obtained subject gains related to enzymes and chemical change. Since it is understood that the activity supports lifelong learning in terms of both the skills developed and the ideas reflected by the pre-service teachers, using similar practices in teacher education can be recommended.

AB  - This study examined the effects of using the Feedback Loop Model (FLM) in Grade 12 Senior High School (SHS) Physics classes. Using a one-group pretest-posttest design, 58 students identified from a simple random sampling method were tested for their conceptual understanding and engagement with in kinematics. The results showed that students' engagement had been significantly affected when their physics teachers practised formative assessment (FA) using the Feedback Loop Model in their synchronous classes. These implications were supported by both quantitative and qualitative data in the study. With the use of Wilcoxon Signed-rank Test, statistical differences were obtained in the four dimensions of the engagement tool in terms of agentic engagement (Z = 3.37, p < .001), behavioural engagement (Z = 4.82, p < .001), emotional engagement (Z = 4.06, p < .001), and cognitive engagement (Z = 4.40, p < .001). Meanwhile, for students' conceptual understanding, the difference between their pre-and posttests mean scores in kinematics revealed a significant difference (t (57) = 17.76, p < .001), suggesting that teachers' classroom practices towards FA using FLM affected students' level of conceptual understanding in Kinematics. Employing Cohen's d to measure its practical significance also showed a large effect (d = 2.83). Thus, it is recommended that implementing FA based on FLM could significantly impact the engagement and learning process of high school physics students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The intervention study presented in this paper explored pre-service science teachers' (PSSTs) understanding of scientific inquiry (SI) and scientific practices (SPs) during a laboratory application in science education course. Thirty-nine secondary school PSSTs, who study in the Science Education Department in a public university in Turkey, enrolled in a 14-week-long course and volunteered to participate in the study. The participants were exposed to a method is called the 4-phase implementation that includes laboratory-based inquiry activities addressing SI and SPs and they completed microteaching presentations. Their understanding of SI and SPs was examined through the course period. The main data sources included Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) Instrument and concept maps were used to track the changes in these understandings. The findings indicated that PSSTs had inadequate understanding of inquiry on some aspects even after the treatment. Yet, the method had positive impact in PSSTs' understanding inquiry especially in terms of facilitating the comprehension that scientific investigations begin with questions, there is no single method in investigations, and explanations are derived from collected data. The concept maps created by some of the participants also supported these results and revealed a more coherent and holistic understanding of SPs by integrating both epistemic and social components into their maps. However, PSSTs did not seem to have totally understood other aspects of inquiry including the inquiry procedures, the research conclusions, and the difference between data and evidence. Further implications are critically discussed in terms of designing future laboratory applications for science education courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Online assessments are needed during the prevailing pandemic situation to continue educational activities while ensuring safety. After conducting the online practical assessment (OPrA) in Biochemistry, we analyzed the students' responses. The blueprint of the OPrA was prepared by the faculty, referring to the various levels and domains of Bloom's taxonomy. Four components were chosen for the online assessment: digital spotters, enumerating the steps of objective structured practical examination, interpretation of quantitative estimation, and case discussion. Each faculty assessed about 12–13 students in separate breakout rooms over 15–20 min on all four components. Feedback on the conduct of the examination was collected from the students and faculty anonymously and analyzed. Out of the 200 students who attended the online assessment, only one scored less than 50%, majority of them scored between 71% and 90%. Under the individual exercises, the average score of students in "Spotters" was 9.8 out of 10; in "OSPE," 8.7 out of 10; in "Quantitative experiments," 15.2 out of 20 and in "Case discussion," 22.4 out of 30. Around 20% had previous experience attending the OPrA. They differed in their opinion from the rest of the students on five aspects; time allotted for the assessment (p value = 0.02, χ2 = 5.07), students using unfair means during the online viva (p value = 0.02, χ2 = 5.57), their computing skills (p value = 0.001, χ2 = 19.82), their performance (p value = 0.001, χ2 = 8.84), and overall conduct of the examination (p value = 0.001, χ2 = 15.55). OPrA tools may be designed referring to Bloom's taxonomy, and prior exposure to the online tools may benefit the students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In engineering practice, open channel water surface profile data frequently serve as the scientific foundation for engineering design, flood forecasting, reservoir scheduling, and the calculation of dam‐break flood evolution. Water surface profiles in open channels (WSPOC), Matrix Laboratory (MATLAB)‐based software was developed to help students better learn and improve their interest in surface line theory. According to the flow characteristics, the program is divided into two modules: steady flow and unsteady flow. The steady flow module guides students to master the judgment methods of various gradually varying flow types and can program independently to explore the solution process of the water surface profiles. The unsteady flow module is designed to help students learn finite difference methods in computational fluid dynamics (CFD), and allow students to interact with software in engineering cases to achieve the purpose of effectively integrating theory and practice. This software employs MATLAB graphical user interface(GUI) visualization technology to embed students' autonomous programming in crucial phases and transforms abstract concepts and theories into vivid animation demonstrations using CFD simulation tools. Furthermore, the transformation from theory to practice has been realized by providing a large number of practical engineering examples, which may improve students' ability to solve complex engineering problems. Based on the survey results, the user experience and application effect of the software are satisfactory, and the software's design objective has been achieved. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Dynamic and Interactive Mathematical Expressions (DIME) Map system automatically generates DIME maps, which are personalizable and manipulable concept maps that allow students to interact with the mathematical concepts contained in any portable document format (PDF) textbook or document. A teacher can automatically upload a PDF textbook chapter and retrieve a DIME map of the contained mathematically based concepts. The DIME map is interactive and manipulable and can be used to interactively navigate the PDF textbook chapter. Our goal was to investigate the relationship between use of DIME maps and student learning outcomes, including self-efficacy and ability to understand and recall connections between physics concepts. We implemented a pretest/posttest to determine if student self-efficacy and connections in knowledge increased after participation in a summer camp physics class. We additionally conducted student interviews to better understand how changes in these two factors may have occurred. We then used multivariate analysis of variance and thematic analysis, finding and investigating positive effects of students using DIME maps, namely growth in self-efficacy and connections in knowledge. Based on our findings, we conclude that DIME maps can be valuable learning tools for students that have positive effects on both cognitive and affective learning outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We discuss situational analysis as an auspicious method for researchers in childhood studies due to its critical-reflexive approach towards power relations, marginalization, and relationalities of collective action--which are topical issues within childhood studies. Especially the position of "implicated actors" (CLARKE & MONTINI, 1993, p.45), a key concept of social worlds/arenas theory, seems conducive towards research about children. However, we also raise concerns about potentially re-marginalizing children in and through research when it is assumed that, as implicated actors, they are not involved in social worlds/arenas and therefore also not involved in social action. We discuss the methodological potentials and pitfalls of social worlds/arenas maps and the use of the concept of implicated actors to analyze children and childhood. We draw from empirical projects and central conceptual debates within childhood studies and focus on three theses: With social worlds/arenas maps 1. researchers are at risk of rendering children invisible; 2. researchers cannot (yet) capture the intragenerational relations of children (as implicated actors); 3. researchers cannot fully account for a relational understanding of children and childhood. Based on these considerations, we suggest how to enable and reconsider the analysis of children and childhood with social worlds/arenas maps using situational analysis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Despite the importance of developing elementary science teachers' content knowledge for teaching (CKT), there are limited assessments that have been designed to measure the full breadth of their CKT at scale. Our overall research project addressed this gap by developing an online assessment to measure elementary preservice teachers' CKT about matter and its interactions. This study, which was part of our larger project, reports on findings from one component of the item development process examining the construct validity of 118 different CKT about matter assessment items. In this study, 86 elementary teachers participated in cognitive interviews to examine: (a) the knowledge and reasoning they used when responding to these CKT about matter assessment items and (b) the nature of the content challenges and the content teaching challenges they encountered. Findings showed that over 80% of participant interview responses indicated that the CKT about matter items functioned as hypothesized, providing evidence to support future use of these items on a large‐scale assessment and in studies of science teachers' CKT. When responding to the items, participants showed evidence of four main challenges with the science content: (a) using scientific concepts to reason about science tasks, (b) using adequate evidence to reason about science phenomenon, (c) drawing upon examples of scientific phenomena, and (d) drawing upon science vocabulary. Findings also showed that participants experienced challenges regarding the following content teaching aspects when responding to these items: (a) connecting to key scientific concepts involved in the work of teaching science, (b) attending to instructional goal(s), and (c) recognizing features of grade‐level appropriateness. Implications for using CKT items as part of large‐scale science assessment systems and identifying areas to target in elementary science teachers' CKT development are addressed.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has become an essential skill nowadays. For young students, CT competency is required to prepare them for future jobs. This competency can facilitate students' understanding of programming knowledge which has been a challenge for many novices pursuing a computer science degree. This study focuses on designing and implementing a virtual reality (VR) game-based application (iThinkSmart) to support CT knowledge. The study followed the design science research methodology to design, implement, and evaluate the first prototype of the VR application. An initial evaluation of the prototype was conducted with 47 computer science students from a Nigerian university who voluntarily participated in an experimental process. To determine what works and what needs to be improved in the iThinkSmart VR game-based application, two groups were randomly formed, consisting of the experimental (n = 21) and the control (n = 26) groups respectively. Our findings suggest that VR increases motivation and therefore increase students' CT skills, which contribute to knowledge regarding the affordances of VR in education and particularly provide evidence on the use of visualization of CT concepts to facilitate programming education. Furthermore, the study revealed that immersion, interaction, and engagement in a VR educational application can promote students' CT competency in higher education institutions (HEI). In addition, it was shown that students who played the iThinkSmart VR game-based application gained higher cognitive benefits, increased interest and attitude to learning CT concepts. Although further investigation is required in order to gain more insights into students learning process, this study made significant contributions in positioning CT in the HEI context and provides empirical evidence regarding the use of educational VR mini games to support students learning achievements.

AB  - Practical, or laboratory, work is a common pedagogical strategy used in school science classrooms, yet its effectiveness for enhancing student learning is contested. Developing teachers' pedagogical knowledge about planning for practical work can improve its effectiveness by ensuring that tasks are well-conceived and effective for linking what students actually do in practical work with the concepts teachers intend them to learn. This paper reports findings from an intervention that aimed to develop pre-service teachers' pedagogical knowledge about planning for practical work. The intervention took place during a 12-week secondary biology teacher preparation method unit over two consecutive years. The intervention introduced the problems associated with ineffective practical work then engaged pre-service teachers in recall, immersion, noticing, microteaching and reflection experiences designed to promote their pedagogical thinking about practical work. The effectiveness of the intervention was assessed using data collected from 76 student assignments and one focus group. Thematic data analysis used declarative and procedural knowledge as a theoretical lens to seek evidence of the development of preservice teachers' pedagogical knowledge. The intervention was found to enhance the development of PST declarative knowledge about various aspects of planning, in particular by recognition of the complexity of planning for practical work, the need to link what students do with objects and the ideas the teacher intends students learn, and the value of reflective practice. Findings indicate more scaffolding is needed to support PSTs when developing procedural knowledge in relation to practical work. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper reports part of a larger study on the development of systems thinking skills in German 7th grade comprehensive school students regarding the climate. Research has shown a fragmented understanding of climate change among students that hardly accounts for the dynamic interrelations in the climate system and may pose a barrier in understanding adaptation and mitigation strategies (Shepardson et al. 2017, 2011, Calmbach 2016). While much is known the impact of short-term interventions on the general system understanding of students, what is lacking to date is 1) a specific intervention on climate system understanding and 2) insights into the process of developing system understanding in students. Helpful insights in this context come from Conceptual Development theories for they allow the development of systemic thinking to be viewed in terms of conceptual expansion or conceptual change. Starting from these desiderates, a teaching-learning sequence was developed based on the SYSDENE model of system competence (Frischknecht et al. 2008). In the sequence young learners systematically link experiences from formal science education with the experiences at three non-formal learning environments. A mixed-methods approach was used to explore the impact of this 3-month sequence on 19 7th grade students. A written pre-/post-test suggested a significant improvement in Climate System Reconstruction for the group (pre-test Median = 6.75 vs. post-test Median = 12.5, Wilcoxon Test: p =.003, r =.82). However, a qualitative analysis of classroom conversations, interviews and concept maps indicated that cognitive development toward a higher level of system thinking was neither continuous nor did every student reach it. Moreover, the SYSDENE model's Competence Area "Describe System Model" proves critical. Being able to describe the main climate system factors is not sufficient, one also needs to be able to distinct weather from climate and grasp several scientific concepts related to the climate (e.g. greenhouse effect, water cycle, evaporation, reflection) in order to understand climate as a system.

AB  - Large lecture courses are an efficient way to convey material to many students but have potential limitations, most notably the tendency for them to promote passive learning opportunities rather than active pedagogies. The curriculum at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University, like many veterinary schools, contains many large lecture courses in the pre‐clinical curriculum. This objective of this study was to use two active pedagogical interventions in a first‐year lecture course named Veterinary Biochemistry and Metabolism that drew connections between basic science and several veterinary diseases. The first intervention targeted increasing students' intrinsic motivation and their confidence with understanding biochemistry concepts using videos created via collaborations between students, staff, and clinical and basic science faculty. The second intervention targeted active and collaborative learning via the implementation of clinical case studies completed in groups to relate lecture content to clinical scenarios with the aim of further enhancing student confidence in their knowledge of the material. To assess the effectiveness of these two interventions, pre‐and post‐course surveys using Likert style questions were administered to evaluate student confidence in the targeted concepts. The post‐survey included open‐ended responses on students' perspectives on their most important takeaways from the activities and their suggestions for improvements. The data showed a positive impact of these interventions on student motivation and confidence in their knowledge. This study provides support that targeted interventions to increase active learning strategies increase student engagement and may improve learning efficacy in large lecture courses.

AB  - In the information age, the acquisition of data literacy skills has become increasingly important for undergraduate student success, yet these skills are not emphasized in the lecture setting. Here we present a study to inspire educators to scaffold graph knowledge and interpretation into their classrooms. Specifically, we sought to understand how frequent use of published graphing materials (Angra & Gardner 2016, 2018) and freely available primary literature and data repositories, complemented by active-learning instructional approaches, in an upper-level animal behavior lecture course affect student graph knowledge and interpretation skills. The effectiveness of graphing materials and students’ graphing abilities were evaluated by three exams over the course of the semester. Findings revealed overall improvement with graph choice and interpretation abilities, particularly in interpreting the purpose of the graph, the nature of the data, and the relationships between independent and dependent variables and take-home messages. These findings support and extend the utility of the graphing materials to undergraduate lecture courses and illustrate the progression of student learning with graph choice and interpretation.

AB  - One of the learning outcomes of learning Animal Embryology and Reproduction is that students can explain concepts about reproduction or embryology theory. Since concept map-based learning can improve students' critical thinking skills and analysis, and support their interest in learning, this study analysed the ability of students enrolled in the 2019/2020 Animal Embryology and Reproduction course to construct concept maps and students' cognitive learning outcomes through assignments and tests. This descriptive study involved 127 students in semester VI enrolled in the Embryology and Animal Reproduction programme at the Department of Biology Education, FTTE at the Universitas Muhammadiyah Malang. The sampling technique was saturated sampling and the data were collected through the task of compiling concept maps and learning outcomes with tests. The drafting of concept maps was assessed by the concepts and ideas, relationships between concepts, hierarchies, propositions, and spelling, with cognitive learning assessed by tests. The results showed that most students had sufficient ability to compose a concept map and very good learning outcomes, indicating that concept maps can be used to learn biology in Animal Embryology and Reproduction courses.

AB  - The integration of history of science (HOS) into science teaching plays a crucial role to address many shortcomings of traditional science teaching in middle schools, due to its close relationship to the nature of science (NOS) and to its ability to reveal the interconnectedness of science to other disciplines. The purpose of this study is to improve seventh grade students’ course engagement and motivation and their understanding of scientific concepts within the unit of “Force and Motion” through the use of history of science-based stories. The study was conducted according to an action research approach. Five stories based on the history of science were developed and administered by one of the researchers in their 7th grade science class. The iterative reflective practice took place over seven weeks with 15 students who met twice a week for two consecutive forty-minute sessions. Throughout this process, researcher journals, semi-structured interviews and a survey were employed for data collection. Teaching with history of sciencebased stories was found to be effective for students’ understanding of concepts related to “force and motion.” The results of the study were also positive with respect to the students’ engagement and motivation. Based on the findings, it is suggested that the nature of science should be addressed explicitly through stories in future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science education reform efforts have emphasized the incorporation of more authentic and meaningful scientific practices into formal learning environments. With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling, a powerful tool for sense‐making and reasoning, comes a need to observe and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross‐national observational study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video‐based datasets from multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for model‐based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., construction, use, evaluation, and revision of scientific models) in regular, day‐to‐day elementary science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and similarities between German and American science instruction. In general, students in both countries experience model construction more often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently foreground anchoring phenomena and students' questions/preconceptions as part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall modeling scores—despite a complete lack of model evaluation and revision in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young learners in both nations seem to experience alarmingly little opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices. Particularly in terms of modeling as a means to make sense of phenomena, constrained by teachers most commonly using finished representations (i.e., models) of phenomena and processes to teach science/deliver content. Our results indicate the need for a greater focus on all scientific modeling subprocesses, particularly the integration of scientific modeling with already established, more general (e.g., inquiry‐based) strategies for effective science teaching and an emphasis on actualizing modeling as an authentic sense‐making endeavor.

AB  - The demand for improving student interest in science has increased efforts toward teaching Einstein’s theory of general relativity in schools. Research has already shown that teaching Einsteinian gravity at the secondary level is feasible, however, appropriate resources must be readily available for science teachers to make Einsteinian gravity part of the school curriculum. This paper addresses student learning through activities that include simple hand-held experiments that help secondary school teachers and their Year 7 students grasp two key concepts that led Einstein to develop his theory of gravity — the speed of gravity and his ‘happiest thought’ about free-fall and weightlessness. The first experiment allows students to conceptualise the speed of gravity. Three further experiments help them explore free-fall and weightlessness in different situations. We analyse the evolving conceptions of Year 7 students (N = 44) on understanding free-fall in an 8-lesson program that includes these experiments in the third lesson. Improvements in students’ understanding over 8 lessons, showed that time and reinforcement were needed to assimilate the concepts. After eight lessons, 86% of students gave an Einsteinian explanation of free-fall. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Teacher questions are one of the crucial components in developing students' concept maps in project-based learning (PjBL). The study aims to measure the quality of students' concept maps and determine the PjBL stages that accommodate concept map quality using an expanded teacher question. This research was a quasi-experiment with 335 students as participants from five senior high schools. To collect the data, teachers used open questions during the PjBL learning process with three categories: main, standard, and expanded teacher questions. The concept map data were collected from students of Biology. The student's concept map score is calculated based on the achievement of the experts' Concept map. Data were analyzed using Manova. The results showed that teacher questions in the PjBL stage increased the concept map component scores, especially in valid relationships and crosslink, while other components increased, no effect, and decreased. The most influential PjBL stage that accommodates concept map quality improvement is the deciding stage. Hence, our findings supported that the deciding stage of PjBL is the primary stage to improve the quality of students' thinking. The expanded teacher's questions in the study group, the way of collecting data, and the data analysis significantly contributed to the improvement in the quality of students' thinking.

AB  - The learning process for a Biology topic regarding organisms and animal kingdom diversity was investigated through an innovative Interactive Didactic Sequence (IDS) which integrated the idea of "concept maps" with the Hermeneutic-Dialectic Circle (HDC). HDC is a tool for data collection and a reference for pluralist-constructivist thinking, considered a form of fourth-generation evaluation. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were also integrated into the investigation in order to facilitate mediation in an evaluative context. Students' performances (N = 25) from a São Paulo-Brazil public school were statistically evaluated. Their cultural profile was determined via the Hofstede Value Survey Model 1994 questionnaire. The elaborative process of arranging concept maps was individual (CM-individual) and integrated with HDC in groups (CM-HDC). Concept map assessment methods were based off existing literature. An improvement in students' performances (p < 0.05) that presented concept maps integrated to HDC in a more complex structure when compared to individually-built maps was observed. Employment of HDC helped form motivational/interactive dialogues between students and teachers, which, in turn, assisted in achieving greater learning through the use of concept maps. The application of the fourth-generation evaluation was improved via knowledge regarding students' cultural profiles. • Practical way applying fourth-generation assessment for meaningful learning. • Concept maps creation in an novelty group way using hermeneutic-dialectic circle. • Hermeneutic-dialectic circle is considered a fourth-generation assessment method. • Conceptual maps with hermeneutic-dialectic circle showed average learning level gains. • Hofstede's cultural dimensions facilitated mediating for fourth-generation assessment.

AB  - Some of the online explainer videos for physics present misconceptions as scientifically correct explanations. Even so, some of these videos achieve good ratings on online platforms. A possible reason is that explainer videos with misconceptions foster an "illusion of understanding"—the mistaken belief that a topic has been understood. Misconceptions close to everyday experiences might appear more attractive than scientifically correct explanations. This experimental study (N = 149 physics learners with a low prior knowledge on average, sample of convenience) was conducted to explore this effect. Two explainer videos were developed to be comparable in terms of comprehensibility and duration. The explanatory approach was the only difference between the two videos. While the experimental group watched a video introducing the concept of force using misconceptions, the control group watched a scientifically correct video. Learners from the experimental group developed an equal belief of understanding, but more misconceptions and fewer scientifically correct conceptions than those from the control group. We argue that this illusion of understanding might become problematic (a) in physics instruction because students who have watched a misleading video might regard further teaching in school as irrelevant, and (b) learners might tend to rate videos including misconceptions better on an online platform like YouTube. Future studies should examine these two possible consequences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The theory of evolution can be a useful basis for developing students' understanding of ecology. Our study used concept maps to examine the development of sixth-grade students' understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem following several evolution 'Science Days' conducted at 'Nature Campus' – an informal learning environment comprised of a natural history museum, zoological and botanical gardens. The programme included physical experiences, such as observations and measurements of fossils, skeletons and mounted specimens, and observations in the zoological and botanical gardens. After the first and fourth days, the students watched the film 'March of the Penguins,' and were asked to draw concept maps depicting the penguins' lives. These maps were then analysed to assess: (a) the changes in the students' depictions of the ecosystem's complexity, and (b) the manner and extent to which they used ideas and concepts in evolution to explain phenomena in the Antarctic ecosystem. We found that the students' concept maps increased in complexity, and their post-maps incorporated concepts in evolution from their experiences at Nature Campus. Our results therefore emphasise the benefits of fundamentally changing how biology education is divided and defined, and transitioning to a more holistic approach that acknowledges the interdisciplinary nature of biological phenomena.

AB  - This study examined a network of concepts used in the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment in relation to somatic cell division and investigated the alignment of science concepts used in them. Textbooks and teachers' instruction and evaluation questions were collected to analyse the alignment between the concepts and the conceptual network used in the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment on the basis of the national science curriculum in the Republic of Korea. The findings of this study suggest that the concept of a cell was used as a linkage, and a lack of conceptual linkage prevailed between the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment in the somatic cell division unit. In comparison with the curriculum, a rapid increase in the number of concepts presented in classes led to a complicated conceptual network. As the conceptual network was complex and ambiguous, the concepts that students can learn are more likely to be ambiguous. Therefore, the conceptual network could be instrumental for facilitating students' conceptual understanding of somatic cell division. The alignment of concepts and conceptual linkage in the teaching of somatic cell division could contribute to improving conceptual associations between the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment.

AB  - Some science subjects are often perceived to be difficult and boring by students due to their nature and the way they are taught. This study sought to check the effectiveness of the technology-enhanced instruction method with comprehensive use of virtual labs and animations in teaching nerve cells' (neurons and glial cells) structures and functions. Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning provided the theoretical model to frame the study. This study used a quasi-experimental design of pre-test and post-test where four secondary schools all from the southern province of Rwanda were selected from two different districts. Two schools from Ruhango District were assigned to the experimental group while the other two schools from Muhanga District were assigned to the control group. The study involved 168 students, 83 forming the control group, and 85 forming the experimental group. The biology test based on nerve cells was used to assess the effect of teaching strategies before and after learning. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 23, and we computed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA. The results indicated that the students who learned nerve cells by use of technology-enhanced instruction of virtual labs and animations outperformed those who learned with conventional methods (M. exp. = 80.41% with SD = 10.32 versus M. cont. = 47.11% with SD = 10.68 and a p-value < 0.05). The results also indicated that after learning with virtual labs and animations, the number of students who were able to perform each of the 20 questions of the test increased considerably. The study recommends the use of virtual labs and animations to enhance students' understanding of nerve cells. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study investigated the impact of PhET simulation-based learning on students' motivation and academic achievement in learning oscillations and waves among Malawian secondary students. The following research questions guided the study: (i) What were students' motivation and academic achievement levels at the beginning of the study in oscillation and waves? (ii) To what levels do PhET interactive simulation-based learning impact students' motivation and achievement in oscillations and waves? (iii) Is the change in post-test scores due to the students' characteristics in non-randomized settings or the PhET interactive simulation-based learning? A sample of 280 (44.6% females) form three secondary school students with a mean age of 17.5 (SD = 1.424) from four schools in Blantyre urban district in Malawi was used in a quasi-experimental design of non-equivalent groups. The experimental group was exposed to PhET simulation-based learning, while the conventional teaching methods were used in the control group. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data on academic achievement, and questionnaires collected data on motivation. Independent samples t-test showed a statistical difference between the two groups on post-test of the academic achievement. Results from linear regression indicated that the differences between the two groups in the post-test were not due to students' characteristics but rather the intervention with p < 0.01. The ANCOVA test on motivation constructs showed a significant difference with a small effect size between the study groups on self-efficacy, active learning strategies, performance goals, achievement goals, learning environment stimulation, and attitudes towards learning with computer learning. The results from the study suggest that PhET simulation-based learning improved the learning of oscillations and waves. PhET simulation-based learning provides visualizations and teaching aids that help easily understand content knowledge, hence improving students' academic achievement and motivation levels.

AB  - Collaborative-metacognitive use of science literature teaching approach (CMSLTA) refers to a researcher-made teaching approach from the Philippines that comprises four components, namely (a) formation of groups with three to four members who have varied reading comprehension ability and assigned rotating roles; (b) use of Scientific Method Learning Plan; (c) reading a science literature including a comic strip, song, parable, poem, infographic, and short story; and (d) answering collaborative-metacognitive prompts in the learning journal. There are separate research studies on the use of science literature and collaborative metacognition in instruction. However, there is a dearth of studies combining the two teaching approaches. In this light, this research examined the effects of CMSLTA on grade 2 students' concept understanding of plants and animals. A two-group pretest–posttest quasi-experimental design was employed on 74 grade 2 students aged six to eight. One group was exposed to CMSLTA while the other group was exposed to the conventional teaching approach (CTA). Findings revealed that CMSLTA significantly improved students' concept understanding. Remarkably, this research aids educators in providing students with early exposure to science and understanding science concepts through the combined use of science literature and collaborative metacognition as a teaching approach.

AB  - In comparison with traditional lectures, active learning methods have the potential to foster learner agency and consequently raise academic performance. However, these methods are often applied with little knowledge about their effectiveness. In this study, we introduced two concept maps in an undergraduate cell biology course, to investigate their effect on student performance, but also mental health, in a quasi-experimental setup. By implementing group tasks into the work, we aimed to reduce feelings of loneliness among the participants, a common phenomenon among students in the study country. We evaluated the effects of the concept maps via exam grades and in an anonymous student survey. Here, we found no increase in student performance after introduction of the active learning task. Students also did not report improvements in their feelings of loneliness. We conclude that this active learning method did not detectably improve student performance or mental health, a result which does not conform to the popular perception of positive effects from active learning. The survey revealed that students do not have a preference for either active learning or traditional lectures, however, the students experienced that the concept map helped them to describe, explain and hypothesize about the topics. Overall, this shows that the concept map method is a valid alternative to traditional lectures, since students perform equally between both learning approaches. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: Access to learning resources in higher education is a prerequisite for effective learning. The purpose of this study is to investigate how marketing of library resources can influences library usage of students from the University of Education Winneba and University of Cape Coast in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study was grounded in the pragmatic paradigm and guided by the mixed methods research approach. The sequential explanatory design was used in that, quantitative data was collected first, followed by the collection of qualitative data. The respondents were selected using the multi-stage and purposive sampling techniques. A total of 1,170 students were involved in the quantitative study, and the qualitative study comprised 12 students and 6 librarians. The quantitative data were analysed descriptively using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), while the qualitative data were analysed thematically. Findings: The study found that the marketing of library resources and services increased awareness and motivates students from the University of Education Winneba and University of Cape Coast to use them. In addition, the study found no relationship between competencies in information literacy and the use of library resources and services beyond developing students' capacity to use library resources The study further established a positive relationship between improved learning activities and the use of library resources and services by students at the University of Education Winneba and University of Cape Coast in Ghana. Originality/value: The study is unique in its scope and focus and will lead understanding to the use of library services and resources to achieving positive learning outcomes in Ghanaian distance learning institutions. Thus, the expanded benefit to students' use of library services not only will improve their academic activities, performances, retention, programme completion, employment opportunities and lifelong learning but also is important for institutions to increase students' enrolments, increase university world-wide visibility and influence national development.

AB  - Learning activities are conducted to help students achieve optimal academic achievement. This research aims to optimize student academic achievement through a learning process that integrates comprehensive formative assessments, including formative tests, self-assessment, peer assessment, and the initiator of creating summaries or concept maps that are given to students in a structured manner at the end of every lesson. The research method used was a quasi-experimental method with a 2x2 factorial design. Students enrolled in the biology education program of the basic physics course for the 1st semester of the 2019 academic year participated in this study. The participants were 66 undergraduate students divided into two classes. Thirty-four students in the experimental group were in class A, while 32 students in the control group were in class B. Data were collected using a learning outcome test instrument to measure academic achievement, which was tested at the end of the semester. Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. This study concluded that a learning process that includes comprehensive formative assessment significantly affects students' academic achievement. These findings support the theory that formative assessment provides feedback, correction, and improvement in student learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this research, the teaching processes of Turkish language and literature, language-expression, mathematics, geometry, physics, accounting in companies, office programs in computers, legal services, legal secretariat, entrepreneurship and business management courses are described. The study, which describes the teaching-learning process of general and vocational courses, was carried out with a "cumulative case" study for 3 years and 5 terms. In the research, the annual plans of 24 teachers were examined and the lessons of these teachers were observed by 94 teacher candidates for 993 lesson hours. With the content analysis of the teachers' annual plans and the written observations of the teacher candidates, the themes of "teaching methodtechnique", "teaching tools" and "assessment tools" emerged. Teachers included teaching methods such as lecturing, question-answer, commentary, case study, problem solving and demonstration in their annual plans. In the classroom observations, it was determined that the teachers mostly used lecturing, testing, question-answer, and dictation methods in their lessons. In annual plans, course tools such as course book, presentation, tests, Eba materials, dictionary and spelling guide, concept maps and magazines were written. However, it was determined that the teachers used textbooks, tests and slides in their lessons, and it was observed that some of them did not use any materials. It has been revealed that teachers also use assessment tools such as multiple-choice and short-answer tests, written exams, and mixed exams in their teaching, which they specify in their annual plans. Although the years and students have changed, it has been revealed that the teachers use similar annual plans, teaching methods, teaching materials and assessment tools in their lessons. In addition, it has been determined that teachers who teach different courses in different schools with different students, use similar annual plans, teaching methods, lesson design and assessment tools in the teaching-learning process of their lessons.

AB  - This article describes how preservice elementary teachers learn about the nature of science and develop scientific literacy through a collaborative project that prepares them to design meaningful learning experiences for students. The Life’s Replica Project was an effort between a college professor and an elementary school teacher to facilitate meaningful science learning. The preservice teachers were students from two college courses in a teacher preparation program. The project’s strategy focused on learning through problematization and inquiry-based activities that engaged participants in diverse and collaborative learner-centered experiences. Students were presented with the problem of human beings’ impact on Earth’s ecosystems, and they were challenged to collaborate through community service by creating and presenting a product that addressed the needs they identified. Some of the project’s assessments were the answers gathered in the KWH table (know, want to know, and how will we learn it), from group reflections on the learning experiences with the core activities of the project, and through the creation of educational materials. The project’s assessment outcomes demonstrated its contribution to the development of meaningful science learning for preservice elementary teachers [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this study, we examined college STEM major students' development of computational thinking through collaborative mobile app coding activities in an undergraduate elective course. The computational thinking concepts of sequence, parallelism, events, conditionals, and operators are evidenced in the block codes of all five apps developed for trigonometry learning (e.g., some combinations of quiz, game, trigonometry conversion tool, or review guide) by students through pair coding. The concept of "data" was evidenced in three of the apps, while the concept of "loops" was not evidenced in any of the apps' block codes. Computational thinking practices such as problem analysis, communicating and collaborating were also evidenced in students' problem-solving processes. artifacts (e.g., app design proposals), design journals, and interview data. Specific codes were included as examples to showcase students' computational thinking concepts and practices during mobile app coding activities. This study demonstrated that computational thinking concepts and practices were evidenced in students' mobile app coding artifacts and during the mobile app coding processes. This study also demonstrates an innovative approach that enables students to develop CT concepts and practices in meaningful contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study identifies proficiency levels in pre‐service physics teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and reveals how teacher education can promote transitions into higher proficiency. Teacher education plays a fundamental role in supporting pre‐service teachers' PCK development. Proficiency levels are a powerful source when evaluating this PCK development because they characterize what learners are likely to be able to know on a specific level. Previous research has presented a model of proficiency levels in pre‐service physics teachers' PCK; however, evidence for the model's validity is still lacking. According to the Refined Consensus Model of PCK, factors such as teachers' content knowledge (CK), their teaching experience, and their beliefs about teaching and learning science promote PCK development. Thus, understanding how and when pre‐service physics teachers' CK, teaching experience, and beliefs contribute to their proficiency can bring insights into how teacher education can promote PCK development. To address this issue, N = 427 observations of pre‐service physics teachers were analyzed. Utilizing the scale anchoring procedure, four different proficiency levels in pre‐service physics teachers' PCK were identified. Analyzing these proficiency levels showed that lower levels can be characterized as remembering content‐unspecific knowledge, whereas higher levels encompass content‐specific strategies to structure and elaborate lessons. Additionally, logistic regression models revealed that pre‐service physics teachers' CK is crucial for an increase in PCK proficiency. However, transitions into higher levels of PCK additionally require teaching experience and adequate beliefs about teaching and learning. Thus, our proficiency levels can be used to bring insights into how proficiency in PCK can be supported during teacher education. For example, teacher education should provide courses focusing on the science curriculum and the assessment of student learning to promote pre‐service physics teachers' progression in PCK.

AB  - Augmented Reality (AR) based learning provides real experiences for educators and new strategies for presenting physics concepts but also provides opportunities for students to interact interactively, spontaneously, and interestingly. Previous research has shown that AR has many advantages in education, but only a few focus on Independent Learning, such as freedom in problem solving and independent learning skills in physics learning. This study develops an Augmented Reality Integration (ARI) learning application based on the Physics Independent Learning (MPIL) model on the marine physics concept. This application is to explore the influence of ARI on 21st-Century Skills (21-CS) which consists of Critical Thinking, Collaboration, Communication, and Creativity. A Quasi-Experimental Method was used, and 88 students aged 20-22 were randomly assigned to the experimental and control groups. After an intervention for 3 weeks, it was found that integrating ARI technology into physics learning can (1) significantly increase students' Creativity Thinking and Critical Thinking on Marine physics concepts; (2) guiding students to further improve in Communication, and Collaboration in solving problems contained in the ARI application; and (3) stimulate students' learning motivation to be enthusiastic about learning physics concepts.

AB  - The phenomenon of misconception and poor conceptual understanding is a problem that often occurs in science learning, not least in physics learning. Learning models that specifically aim to improve conceptual understanding and remediate misconceptions are not widely available. This study aims to determine the effect of the CCBL model in improving conceptual understanding and remediating misconceptions of students. The method consisted of pretest-posttest control group quasi-experimental design. The sample consisted of 89 students from three groups in the physics department. The research instrument was a static fluid concept test, a type of two-level multiple-choice test, and an open reason answer. Percentage techniques and descriptive narrative were used to obtain the level of understanding of students' concepts. These results indicated that the CCBL model was effective in remediating student misconceptions. The implication of this research is that the CCBL model has the syntax that capable of remediating students' misconceptions, namely; (1) activation of preconceptions and misconceptions; (2) presentation of cognitive conflict; (3) discovery of concepts and equations; and (4) reflection. It is recommended to conduct further research to see the significance of the effectiveness of the CCBL model. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Electricity is a very important concept in learning Physics. Mastering this concept can make learning Physics meaningful and relatable to real life problems. However, literature indicates that students have poor conceptual understanding of concepts about electricity. The current research aims to improve Form 5 (aged 17 years) students' understanding of direct current circuits by using Concept Cartoons Worksheets. Concept Cartoons are A single-group pre-test/post-test investigation was carried out using seven Concept Cartoons Worksheets designed to address common conceptual misconceptions about direct current circuits with a total of 30 physics student participants. The seven Concept Cartoons were modified based on the Concept Inventory Test "Determining and Interpreting Resistive Electric Circuit Concepts Test (DIRECT). Concept Cartoons Worksheets were used to correct students' misconceptions about direct current circuits and to increase their level of conceptual understanding. The data collected were analysed quantitatively to obtain percentages, means, and t-test values. The descriptive statistics showed an increase in the level of student's conceptual understanding after the use of Concept Cartoons. The t-test analysis reported that the difference was significant. The results show that Malaysian students do havemisconceptions about electricity concepts. However, Concept Cartoons Worksheets are effective to overcome students' misconceptions about electrical concepts, specifically toward current circuits. Concept Cartoons are not only effective in overcoming misconceptions among students, they are also refreshing and unique because of the cartoons presented while relating to Physics concepts that are abstract.

AB  - It is often challenging for physics instructors to dedicate time during a course to engage students in developing strategic approaches to learning in addition to problem-solving skills and content knowledge. In this work, we introduce a simple modification to our teaching practice with the purpose of fostering student development of self-regulated learning (SRL). Instructional practices supportive of self-regulated learning are associated with positive academic, social, and personal outcomes in higher education. Research also indicates that students can improve in their self-regulation over time, and we demonstrate that instructors can support this development in class with strategies that require minimal class time. In the context of classroom instruction, we can think of SRL as an intentional, active, and goal-driven engagement in learning activities that relies on metacognitive knowledge and skills.

AB  - Concept mapping remains widely used in education. However, little is known about how self‐constructed concept maps and peer feedback can improve student learning outcomes in chemistry. We investigated the effects of peer feedback on concept mapping and how it improves students' learning performance in a large second‐semester, introductory chemistry course. Three hundred and twenty students were randomly assigned to one of two concept mapping conditions: self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback and self‐constructed concept map without peer feedback. Each group constructed concept maps that depicted the relationship between concepts on the topic of intermolecular force. The results showed that students in the self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback condition outperformed students in the no peer feedback condition in chemistry learning outcome. Overall, this study demonstrates that peer feedback enhances the effectiveness of learning with generative concept maps. The implications and future directions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa secondary school science curricula recognise language as the most important communication tool for learners' biology learning outcomes. Despite this prominent goal, learners' scientific literacy at secondary school appears to be insufficient to cope with classroom teaching and learning of biology. This paper presents a review of literature regarding the way English as the language of instruction and inquiry-based learning strategies affect biology learning in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools. The scope of the review included journal articles, books and book chapters published in the period from 2005 to 2020 on the English language of instruction in biology education in Sub-Saharan Africa. We established criteria for first article searches indexed in Scopus, African Journals Online, the Education Resources Information Center, Web of Science and Psych Info as recognised index systems for science education. We considered studies related to the understanding of learners' language backgrounds, language-in-education policy and pedagogical language strategies (practice) that mediate learning. In this case, 53 studies were identified after removing redundancies; 27 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria when screened by key words and abstract and reviewed for eligibility; and only nine were selected after evaluating the full texts. The review analysis suggests that there is a gap in the corpus of literature on what and how pedagogical language strategies should be utilised to support meaningful learning of biology in multilingual settings. Poor learners' academic achievement and conceptual engagement in biology at secondary school level were the main effects reported by the reviewed literature. Less is still known about the effect of the use of inquiry-based learning strategies on learners' conceptual engagement in multilingual biology classrooms. We recommend formulating a clear policy articulation on the use of bilingual instructions in teaching and learning of biology at the secondary school level; assessing teacher and learner performance over pedagogical language strategies; and evaluating the contribution of IBL strategies in addressing language barriers in biology learning for higher order thinking skills in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools.

AB  - Teachers' spatial behaviours in the classroom can strongly influence students' engagement, motivation and other behaviours that shape their learning. However, classroom teaching behaviour is ephemeral, and has largely remained opaque to computational analysis. Inspired by the notion of Spatial Pedagogy, this paper presents a system called 'Moodoo' that automatically tracks and models how teachers make use of the classroom space by analysing indoor positioning traces. We illustrate the potential of the system through an authentic study with seven teachers enacting three distinct learning designs with more than 200 undergraduate students in the context of science education. The system automatically extracts spatial metrics (e.g. teacher-student ratios, frequency of visits to students' personal spaces, presence in classroom spaces of interest, index of dispersion and entropy), mapping from the teachers' low-level positioning data to higher-order spatial constructs. We illustrate how these spatial metrics can be used to generate a deeper understanding of how the pedagogical commitments embedded in the learning design, and personal teaching strategies, are reflected in the ways teachers use the learning space to provide support to students.

AB  - The teachers should support students in acquiring knowledge and developing skills thus preparing them to think and learn independently. Considering this, the significance of implementing the modified Know-Want-Learn (KWL) teaching strategy, which directs students to perform metacognitive activities, becomes more evident. Quasi-experimental research was used to investigate the correlation between elementary school students' physics performance and metacognition regarding the use of a modified KWL strategy. The study included an experimental and control group and a pre-test and post-test research method. Two physics knowledge tests and a questionnaire on metacognition were distributed to the 110 sixth-grade students in the elementary school. Results indicated that statistically significant correlation existed between students' performance in physics and metacognition when the traditional teaching method was used. At the same time, there was no statistically significant correlation when a modified KWL strategy was used. It can be indicated that, while addressing the problem of poor students' performance, an improvement can be seen in case of the metacognition. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps have been verified as an effective learning tool in technology-supported learning environments, in particular, in K-12 education. To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Creating concept maps is considered to be a powerful means for learning. It requires students to systematically organize and integrate their knowledge, which can foster meaningful learning. However, students scarcely spontaneously engage in the (meta)cognitive processes necessary for effective knowledge integration, such as reflection, which can hamper the effectiveness of concept mapping for learning. This study explores the effect of additional support that stimulates reflection by means of expert examples, reflection prompts, and classroom discussion. First-year technical vocational students (N = 144, Mage = 17.5 years) studied electricity-related topics in an online learning environment and created concept maps about their knowledge. Students' concept maps were supplemented with either (1) no support (control condition), (2) an expert example (a combined concept map, containing their own and an expert example concept map, with differences highlighted), (3) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually, (4) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually after a teacher-guided classroom discussion. Students in the classroom discussion condition showed higher learning gains compared to all other conditions. This can be explained by the quality of their reflection, which proved to be a significant predictor of learning gain. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0–5 years, 6–14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Through the artistic planning tool known to comic book artists and animators as storyboarding, students will embark on comic book–style adventures to plan, describe, and visualize the complex life of genes through the non-Mendelian concept of epistasis. Using storyboard templates, conceptual layouts, sketch booking, and cut-out genetic elements, students will construct their interpretation of the gene-gene interactions of epistasis. The incomplete story of the epistasis of human eye color will serve as the theme for this storyboard, which will also become its own assessment tool, inviting educators into a realm of a true STEAM experience.

AB  - Purpose: By envisioning the learning environment as an eco-social system, this study aims to map interrelated enablers of students' sustainability-oriented learning (SoL) in the context of a university course at the interface of science and society. Design/methodology/approach: A case-study approach was used to delineate what enables student learning in a university-wide transdisciplinary Master of Science course. A sample of 102 students, university and societal stakeholders participated to this study, by sharing their experiences and views through focus groups and questionnaires. Findings: A main finding is the development of a configuration of six intertwined enablers that through their interplay help to cultivate students' SoL, in the course under exploration. Originality/value: This study paves the way for a re-orientation of how to explore learning in complex environments. It shows that adopting a relational, situated and systems approach is not only feasible but is also desirable to understand and guide learning practices in complex environments.

AB  - Our civilization recognizes that errors can be valuable learning opportunities, but for decades, they have widely been avoided or, at best, allowed to occur as serendipitous accidents. The present research tested whether greater learning success could paradoxically be achieved through making errors by intentional design, relative to traditional errorless learning methods. We show that deliberately committing and correcting errors even when one knows the correct answers enhances learning—a counterintuitive phenomenon that we termed the derring effect. Across two experiments (N = 160), learners engaged in open-book study of scientific expository texts and were then tested on their retention and higher-order application of the material to analyze a novel news event. Deliberate error commission and correction during study produced not only better recall performance, but also superior knowledge application compared to two errorless study techniques that are popular among students and educational researchers: copying with underlining, and elaborative studying with concept mapping (Experiment 1). These learning benefits persisted even over generating alternative conceptually correct answers, revealing that the derring effect is not merely attributable to generation or elaboration alone, but is unique to producing incorrect responses (Experiment 2). Yet, learners were largely unaware of these advantages even after experiencing them. Our results suggest that avoiding errors in learning may not always be most optimal. Rather, deliberate erring is a powerful strategy to enhance meaningful learning. We discuss implications for educational practice in redesigning conventional approaches to errors: To err is human; to deliberately err is divine. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Errors are ripe with learning opportunity, but have traditionally been avoided or simply allowed to occur spontaneously. Here, we provide evidence for the derring effect—deliberately committing and correcting errors even when we know the correct answers enhances learning. Relative to popular errorless techniques such as copying with underlining, concept mapping, and even generating alternative correct answers, deliberate erring improved not only knowledge retention, but also higher-order application of learning. Yet, students were largely unaware of these benefits. Deliberate erring is a powerful way of learning from failure for greater success. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigated in what ways and to what extent the interactions between the components of pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) differ for junior high school science teachers with different levels of content knowledge. Data were collected from three science teachers through semi-structured interviews and classroom observations. The participants' content knowledge was analyzed based on inductive coding and the teachers were labeled as curriculum-led, content-expert, and content-novice. Interactions among PCK components were analyzed by making an in-depth analysis of explicit PCK. This included constructing PCK maps for each participant. Then, the constant comparative method was used to clarify differences in interactions among PCK components. Five assertions were proposed based on the differences among PCK interactions: (a) the curriculum-led teacher had the most integrated PCK map and the interactions were mainly reciprocal; (b) the most frequent interactions between knowledge of assessment and the other PCK components were observed in the content-expert teacher; (c) the most frequent interactions between knowledge of curriculum and the other PCK components were observed in the curriculum-led teacher's teaching; (d) the content-novice teacher's orientation interacted with the other PCK components more than in the other two participants' teaching; (e) the main ideas of the interactions among PCK components changed depending on the teachers' content knowledge. The findings are discussed and suggestions for researchers and teachers are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the past decade, sociologists have become increasingly interested in the formal study of semantic relations within text. Most contemporary studies focus either on mapping concept co-occurrences or on measuring semantic associations via word embeddings. Although conducive to many research goals, these approaches share an important limitation: they abstract away what one can call the event structure of texts, that is, the narrative action that takes place in them. I aim to overcome this limitation by introducing a new framework for extracting semantically rich relations from text that involves three components. First, a semantic grammar structured around textual entities that distinguishes six motif classes: actions of an entity, treatments of an entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients acted upon by an entity, characterizations of an entity, and possessions of an entity; second, a comprehensive set of mapping rules, which make it possible to recover motifs from predictions of dependency parsers; third, an R package that allows researchers to extract motifs from their own texts. The framework is demonstrated in empirical analyses on gendered interaction in novels and constructions of collective identity by U.S. presidential candidates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper presents an experimental study conducted on employing Active Learning strategies towards enhancing the attainment of learning outcomes of a course "Linear Control Systems" in the undergraduate (UG) Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) programme. The existing UG programme curriculum is retrofitted into outcome-based curriculum. The Programme Outcomes (POs) for this programme are derived from the Graduate Attributes of Washington Accord (WA). In order to meet the POs, Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) are written predominantly in the Cognitive (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) and Psychomotor (Dave's taxonomy) domains for lecture-based courses and laboratory courses, respectively and very few are written in Affective (Bloom's taxonomy) domain. In this paper, four CLOs (i) Discuss the various classification of control systems (K2), (ii) Define the time and frequency response of the system (K2), (iii) Derive the overall transfer function of the given Block diagram of a system (K3) and (iv) Derive the overall transfer function of a Signal Flow Graph (SFG) of a system (K3) are considered to measure the effectiveness of active learning methods in attaining the outcome. Active learning methods such as Jigsaw, Think-pair-share and Peer instruction, and traditional lecture-based methods were employed. In addition, ClassComm software with student interactive devices was used to measure the students' learning in the classroom and subsequently the attainment of CLOs. This study compares the effectiveness of active learning methods with the traditional lecture-based instruction method in relation to the attainment of CLOs. The overall analysis results reveal that both instructors and students received the active learning methods very well, and they are very effective in enhancing the attainment of learning outcomes. However, instructors are of the view that the duration of the contact period should be at least two hours. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Genetics is one of the hard to learn biological concepts owing to its connectedness to Latin / Greek origin. Hence, the need for its proper structuring for easy comprehension by the students. The effectiveness of text structure on students' proper understanding had been widely reported in literature, hence, this study investigated score levels, text structures and senior secondary school students' achievement in genetics. Specifically, the study assessed the: (i) variation in the achievement of students taught using different text structures (ii) interaction effects of text structures and score levels on senior school students' achievement in genetics among others. A quasiexperimental design of pretest, posttest, non-equivalent, and non-randomized control group was adopted. A total of 239 students purposively selected took part in the study. ANCOVA was used to analysed the hypotheses at 0.05 alpha level. Findings indicated that there was (i) a statistically significant difference in the achievement of students exposed to different text structure i.e., F (2, 238) = 15.11 at p < 0.05; (ii) no statistically significant difference in the interaction effects of text structure and score level. The implication of the finding is that the two structured texts were useful for improving senior school students' achievement in genetics. It was therefore, recommended that biology teachers should consider logical prose and concept maps in structuring their instructional materials. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Educators within agricultural and natural resource disciplines are tasked with educating students to critically engage with and problem-solve complex issues. As society's relationship with science and technology changes, coupled with an information-dense environment, strategies for sustainably addressing complex issues are needed. One potential approach for strategically addressing complex problems is systems thinking, which emphasizes the interdependence of the components of systems from ecological, social, and economic perspectives, among others. A mixed-methods study was used to explore the applicability of hypothetical case scenarios (HCS) as a teaching method to introduce and engage students in using systems thinking related to the seafood industry. Findings suggested HCS engaged students to think critically about socio-scientific issues. Participants demonstrated systems thinking capacity when discussing their decision-making processes in the hypothetical cases. The current study demonstrated the pedagogical potential of using HCS to enhance systems thinking capacities for students in the ANR disciplines. Implications for education and recommendations for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The use of augmented reality (AR) technology in the science curriculum has the potential to assist students in comprehending abstract and complex concepts or unobservable phenomena, as well as to better explain knowledge regarding science content by superimposing virtual objects over genuine items or environments in a multidimensional approach. However, the overall effects on students' academic achievement of using AR technology in scientific courses and the key factors that influence such effects are still unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis in this work to systematically review 35 empiric trials (with 39 effect sizes) that used experimental or quasi-experimental approaches to determine the academic achievement of using AR techniques in science-related courses. In addition, we explored possible moderators such as differences in disciplines, educational stages, types of AR (marker-based, markerless-based, or location-based), display devices (mobiles, tablets, computers, or headsets), intervention duration, group size, and instructional strategies. The results revealed that the overall mean effect size (with AR into instruction vs without AR into instruction) was 0.737 under the random effects model, indicating a medium-to-large significant positive effect on students' academic achievement. The disciplines had significant moderating effects, types of AR had marginally significant effects, while educational stages, display devices, intervention duration, group size, and strategies used had insignificant influence. The impact of AR technology on scientific education was discussed in connection to the above seven moderators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students—even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a powerful learning tool because of the feedback provider's active cognitive involvement with the products to be reviewed. The quality of peers' products is naturally an important factor that might influence not only the quality of the feedback that is given, but also the learning arising from this process. This experimental study investigated the effect of the level of quality of the reviewed product on the knowledge acquisition of feedback providers, as well as the role of prior knowledge in this. Dutch secondary-school students (n = 77) were assigned to one of three conditions, which varied in the quality of the learning products (concept maps) on which students had to give feedback while working in an online physics inquiry learning environment. Post-test knowledge scores, the quality of students' own concept maps and the quality of the feedback given were analyzed to determine any effect of condition on the learning of feedback providers. Students providing feedback on the lower-quality concept maps gave better feedback and had higher post-test scores. There was no interaction with level of prior knowledge. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: This infecological study mainly aimed to know the thematic and conceptual relationship in published papers in deep learning (DL) and smart manufacturing (SM). Design/methodology/approach: The research methodology has specific research objectives based on the type and method of research, data analysis tools. In general, description methods are applied by Web of Science (WoS) analysis tools and Voyant tools as a web-based reading and analysis environment for digital texts. The Yewno tool is applied to draw a knowledge map to show the concept's interaction between DL and SM. Findings: The knowledge map of DL and SM concepts shows that there are currently few concepts interacting with each other, while the rapid growth of technology and the needs of today's society have revealed the need to use more and more DL in SM. The results of this study can provide a coherent and well-mapped road map to the main policymakers of the field of research in DL and SM, through the study of coexistence and interactions of the thematic categories with other thematic areas. In this way, they can design more effective guidelines and strategies to solve the problems of researchers in conducting their studies and direct. The analysis results demonstrated that the information ecosystem of DL and SM studies dynamically developed over time. The continuous conduction flow of scientific studies in this field brought continuous changes into the infoecology of subjects and concepts in this area. Originality/value: The paper investigated the thematic interaction of the scientific productions in DL and SM and discussed possible implications. We used of the variety tools and techniques to draw our own perspective. Also, we drew arguments from other research work to back up our findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - acquisition of bioscience knowledge is challenging for nursing students. This calls for teaching methodologies that allow them to acquire this knowledge and add value in the nursing context. to evaluate a teaching experience using a movie clip and the collaborative use of C-Maps in first-year bioscience learning in nursing students. embedded mixed methods study. 143 students. data were collected in two phases: first, collecting quantitative data through a questionnaire on utility, satisfaction and perceived competency development, and collecting qualitative data on learning, teaching materials and developed competencies through an open-question instrument. The second phase consisted of a focus group to explore in greater depth learning experience. six themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: using C-Maps as a learning process; developing group competencies; knowledge integration and transfer; teacher-student relationship; art as a didactic support; and difficulties encountered and proposals for improvement. Regarding utility, the students highlighted learning and relating concepts. Elements of satisfaction were working in small groups and having the teacher as a guide. Finally, the competencies most developed were teamwork and learning ability. the combination of a movie clip and a C-Map is an innovative strategy motivating and valuable for learning biosciences. • Cinema and CMaps elaborated in groups turn out to be useful for the learning of biosciences. • The most developed competences are teamwork and the ability to learn. • The students recognise the integration of knowledge and the possibility to transfer it to a clinical context. • This combination of strategies allows for a flexible and creative way of developing knowledge.

AB  - A nursing programme in southern Sweden was revised to meet future demands. The aim of this study was to explore important conceptual areas to be included in a nursing programme in order to meet long-term societal and health care requirements. Group concept mapping (GCM), a mixed-methods approach, was used. Thirty-four experienced teachers participated. Data was collected during brainstorming sessions in focus groups. Following editing and removal of duplicates, 101 statements remained to be sorted into piles that had similar conceptual representation in nursing education. The final step was then to rate each statement from 1 to 5 (higher values = more important/more feasible). Quantitative analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in 11 clusters. Assessment and treatment and Person-centred care were rated as the most important and Scientific theories and methods , Basic caregiving in nursing and Person-centred care had the highest feasibility ratings. Further analyses suggested that the content of nursing education can be seen from a systems theory perspective, represented by the macro, meso, and micro levels. These levels may increase the understanding of the complexity of nursing care. Furthermore, the cluster analysis can facilitate the development of a concept-based curriculum for nursing education. • When developing a concept-based curriculum it is suitable to use a system theoretical perspective (macro, meso and micro). • Group concept mapping (GCM) is a feasible method for developing a concept-based curriculum. • By involving teachers, the transition from a content-based curriculum to a concept-based curriculum is facilitated.

AB  - How do archivists who find themselves in dual librarian/archivist positions approach library instruction and reference services? This case study examines the instructional experiences of an archivist serving in an interim role as a liaison librarian to a public affairs college at a large, public university in the United States. Utilizing action research methodology to study and inform their instruction approach and philosophy, the archivist created an instructional model which incorporates archival principles and concepts into a landscape mapping exercise. Archivists can make material contributions to library instruction through their unique knowledge, skills, and perspectives. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The main objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of technology-integrated formative assessment strategies on students' retention of conceptual and procedural knowledge in chemical equilibrium concepts. A quasi-experimental control group interrupted time series design was employed. Data were collected from 132 students, who were selected using a random sampling technique from three governmental secondary schools. Two experimental groups and one comparison group were involved in the study. A series of chemical equilibrium conceptual and procedural tests were used to collect data. A mixed model analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the test scores. The three groups had varied mean gain scores in conceptual and procedural examination scores as repeated measurements of time, as can be observed from the descriptive statistics. The two-way mixed ANOVA findings revealed that there was a significant main effect between groups on conceptual test scores. Furthermore, on conceptual knowledge test scores, there was a significant interaction between time point and intervention groups. On procedural examination scores, there was also a significant difference between the 3-time points and intervention groups. A significant interaction between time points and groups was also observed. Given that there was a significant difference between the pre-test, post-test, and follow-up post-test scores in the experimental group, with the difference favoring the post-test scores, it can be concluded that the technology-integrated formative assessment strategy is successful in raising secondary school students' conceptual and procedural test scores.

AB  - The concept of self-directedness is a missing link in South African science classrooms, and as a result, science teachers are often not self-directed in employing innovative teaching and learning strategies such as blended problem-based learning (BPBL) that might enhance self-directed learning. The literature is replete with studies showing that science teachers in the United States, Indonesia, and South Africa, to name a few, lack the necessary technological skills to utilize simulations in the teaching and learning of physical sciences. This intervention-based explanatory mixed methods study was conducted in one of the nine education provinces of South Africa. Quantitative data were generated using a self-directed learning instrument (SDLI), the Physics Education Technology interactive simulations questionnaire, and a PBL questionnaire. Forty participants were sampled using both cluster and systematic random sampling techniques. Qualitative data were generated through a BPBL scenario, a reflective portfolio, and semi-structured interviews with two purposively selected participants. The quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive and parametric statistics. The reflective portfolio was analyzed using performance standards scoring rubric adopted from Smith et al. (2001). The BPBL Scenario Evaluation Schedule and interviews were analyzed using Saldaña's (2013) code-to-theory analytical model. It was concluded that there was a significant difference in participants' perceptions of PBL, self-directedness, and interactive simulations after attending a teacher professional development intervention (TPDI) and implementing BPBL. The findings show that the utilization of interactive simulations and PBL in physical sciences classrooms was unknown to teachers - suggesting that teachers were not self-directed in implementing BPBL. This study presents a model for designing BPBL activities and an evaluation schedule for assessing those activities for self-directedness in educational practices. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students' perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students' developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students' perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students' perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students' science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students' learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students' perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - Scientific modeling is a practice that we use frequently in our undergraduate biomedical applications course for nonscience majors. We use case studies in which students apply course concepts to create cause-and-effect models. In this article, we describe a case study assessment on protein synthesis that examines the use of CRISPR to bring back the mammoth (i.e., de-extinction). Students learn about protein synthesis throughout the course and work on various case study scenarios to apply those concepts. Their final assessment is a team project to illustrate how protein synthesis is influenced by gene editing, including gene expression and its regulation, transcription, translation, protein structure and function, and the ultimate impact on an organism's phenotype. Although we use this case study as an assessment, it is also appropriate as a class activity in which students practice modeling the CRISPR gene-editing system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explores whether learning approaches combining augmented reality and multidimensional concept maps (ARMCMs) would improve learning effectiveness, learning motivation, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load more than multidimensional concept maps (MCMs) and augmented reality (AR) learning do. The study employed a quasi-experimental design, and the subjects were 93 students from an elementary school in Taiwan. By dividing the students into ARMCMs group, MCMs group, and AR group, the results show that the learning with ARMCMs can provide better promotion on learning motivation and positive influences on learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load.

AB  - Previous research has illustrated the potential of flipped learning for assisting teachers in designing meaningful activities to promote students' higher order thinking skills; however, several previous studies have challenged the effects of flipped learning on students' learning. One of the key problems is the lack of an effective learning approach or tools to engage students in the flipped learning activity. In this study, a concept mapping-based Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE) approach was incorporated into flipped learning (called CPOE-FL) to enhance students' scientific learning. Furthermore, a three-group experiment was conducted to assess the effects of the three flipped learning models, comprising the CPOE-FL approach, the POE-FL (incorporating POE into flipped learning) approach, and the C-FL (conventional flipped learning) approach. The experimental results displayed that the CPOE-FL approach can benefit the learning achievements and self-efficacy of the students with respectively lower prior knowledge and lower initial self-efficacy, in comparison with the POE-FL and C-FL approaches. Both the CPOE-FL and POE-FL approaches promoted the students' inner learning motivation, while the CPOE-FL approach enhanced the students' critical thinking. This proposed approach could provide a good reference for researchers or school teachers intending to implement POE-based flipped learning in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Location -based learning refers to place-based education conducted online with the use of geographic information systems and mobile devices; with the shift to distance learning, its integration in science education warrants careful evaluation. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of location-based learning on students' understanding of Newton's laws of motion and to characterize the learning outcomes. The participants were 373 eighth-grade students, divided into two groups: control (n = 167) — teacher-centered, textbook-oriented instruction — and experimental (n = 206) — student-centered, location-based learning. The study applied a quasi-experimental research design, within a framework of a mixed-methods approach, in which data were collected through pre- and post-questionnaires and the analysis of students' learning outcomes. The findings indicated a significant positive effect for the location-based learning approach on students' ability to generate and answer science-related questions, provide reasoned explanations, and connect scientific topics to daily life. Significant relationships were indicated between students' ability to generate questions and their ability to provide reasoned explanations. The study points to the importance of engaging students in location-based learning and in the process of generating science-related questions, information points on a digital map, and multimedia features.

AB  - Didactic lectures and exam-oriented learning can lead to students becoming passive learners who rely on rote memory. This learning style negatively impacts their ability to cultivate the core nursing values and critical thinking. This study aimed to investigate the impact of a concept mapping teaching-learning strategy on undergraduate nursing students' ability to integrate theoretical biosciences knowledge into care practice and on their skills in critical thinking and teamwork. A qualitative research design was adopted. A course entitled Evaluation and Analysis of Adult Nursing Cases was developed based on a concept mapping strategy involving 24 simulated cases relevant to medical and surgical nursing. The participants were students from the two-year undergraduate nursing programme at a university in Taiwan. Data were collected from September 2020 to February 2021. Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 20 students and from 100 reflective reports on students' learning journeys. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Two major themes were identified: (1) changes in learning style and thinking and (2) rewards from learning. The participants reported that their learning style had changed from reliance on rote learning to image memory, and their thinking process from linear (cause-effect) to multifaceted thinking at different levels. The teaching and learning strategies contributed to feelings of ability advancement and psychological safety, which led to learning achievement and confidence. The use of a concept mapping strategy and simulated cases enhanced students' learning by enabling them to integrate theoretical knowledge and improve their thinking abilities. The teaching and learning strategies helped participants in learning about psychological safety and increased their learning confidence. • The use of concept mapping facilitated the integration of multidisciplinary theoretical knowledge. • Simulated case studies connected theoretical knowledge and clinical practice. • Group learning activated learning and maintained students' learning psychological safety. • Learning psychological safety stimulated both learning potential and learning achievement. • The teaching and learning strategies influenced cultivation of core nursing values.

AB  - Here, we describe a free, web‐based simulation of the lac operon, "LacOp," that is designed to enhance the learning of prokaryotic gene regulation and pathways in advanced high school and undergraduate genetics courses. This new electronic resource was created by a team of students in an advanced undergraduate course and is hosted online (http://flask-env.rnwhymamqf.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com/lacop). LacOp has a simple web interface compatible with a range of devices, including smartphones. To determine whether the LacOp simulation enhances student learning from traditional instruction, we introduced the lac operon to undergraduate genetics students through a traditional classroom experience followed by use of the LacOp simulation. Students worked on their own using the included tutorial to create and test the effect of various genotypes on E. coli lactose metabolism and regulation. Upon completion of the tutorial, students showed measurable gains in conceptual understanding of the lac operon. These students also reported a generally favorable opinion of the LacOP simulation as a use of their instructional time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Student investment in learning is often stronger when learning incorporates student choice, "realworld" authenticity, and creativity. This action research study investigated the impact of a particular tool for emphasizing these elements in learning: a free-choice, or "Genius Time," project in which middle school students in an independent all-boys school were asked to develop and carry out an individual project to investigate anything of their choosing as part of their regular science class. This study aimed to determine how a project like this could impact student skill-building, self-efficacy, motivation, and student learning through the practice of inquiry. Through surveys, student self-assessment, student interviews, and teacher journaling, the results showed that this project was successful in building essential 21st-century skills, such as initiative, risk-taking, persistence, and resilience. In addition, students were engaged in meaningful inquiry learning because they were required to exercise and grow their own agency for learning, including their self-efficacy. Finally, this project may have facilitated a shift in participant personal motivation toward more intrinsic (rather than extrinsic) factors. These findings support a larger body of research and reporting about the effectiveness of project-based learning, and free-choice or passion projects in particular, to engage students with inquiry in meaningful ways.

AB  - Though concept maps and graphic organisers are useful tools for bilinguals to organise the information being managed and learned, its systematic use is not widened and decisive in CLIL domains. Apart from helping students to acquire meaningful learning, concept mapping might promote in them word-recognition skills for the identification and management of relevant information within foreign language (L2) texts. Hence, this article inquires into the influence of concept maps and graphic organisers as tools for noun category identification from L2 texts. Research sample comprises sixty Spanish primary education students from a bilingual school. Design is quasi-experimental, and the training programme lasted three weeks. Materials used during the training period are not exceptional, but the ordinarily found in regular classrooms. Data gathering procedure consists of the identification and circling of nouns by sample participants. As a starting point, secondary data as the intelligent quotient, learning style, and English level is collected via standardised tests. The analysis of the variance showed a highly significant interaction between the groups and the implemented texts both for noun identification (F3.171 = 12.124, p < 0.000, η2 = 0.175), and the grammatical categories mistakenly identified as nouns (F3.171 = 3.840, p < 0.016, η2 = 0.063).

AB  - The difficulty of tutors in all types of learning (face-to-face and online) is when they teach abstract concepts in modern physics courses, especially to improve students' reasoning skills. We see an opportunity that advances in digital technology can help overcome this problem. This study aims to improve the reasoning performance of STEM students in modern physics courses using virtual simulation integrated with the LMS platform. Experimental design was prepared with one control group (face-to-face learning with expository method). The sample was 54 STEM students at the University of Mataram which was divided into the experimental group (n = 27) and the control group (n = 27). Reasoning skills were measured using an essay test instrument, and the results were analyzed descriptively (analysis of increasing reasoning skills scores) and statistically (analysis of differences in reasoning skills scores between sample groups). The results of this study have clearly shown that the reasoning performance of STEM students in modern physics courses can be improved by learning using virtual simulation on the LMS platform. Descriptive and statistical analysis of the reasoning performance of STEM students shows the advantages of learning using virtual simulation when compared to face-to-face learning that relies on expository methods. We recommend using virtual simulation on the LMS platform to teach abstract concepts that are not limited to modern physics but in science learning in general. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In recent years, more and more systematic research has been conducted in science fields, focusing on identifying alternative ideas that the students have for essential concepts and principles of physics. This has resulted in the production of essential and valuable international bibliographic information in various science fields, including mechanics. In the present paper, we focus on physics, particularly in classical mechanics, including key concepts such as weight, energy, force, action/reaction, and work. A multiple-choice questionnaire was given to senior students of primary school, middle school, and Cyprus's high school. We analyzed the percentage of correct and incorrect responses of the three survey groups to determine whether the responses were related to the group's age or representative of statistical fluctuations. For most questions, there was a statistically significant correlation with age, as opposed to gender, which does not appear to play a role in students' correct answers. In particular, our results suggest that the alternative conceptions of students, reflecting misconceptions and preconceptions, reduce with age or equivalently with the education level. Nevertheless, there are also many questions for which such a correlation cannot be established. Our study can be used in science teaching, on the design of curricula, and teachers' professional development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to test how the collaborative constructivist learning strategies can reduce the gap in students’ understanding of biological concepts, compared to Novick’s constructivist strategies, and student team achievement divisions (STAD) collaborative strategies. Six classes of tenth graders consisted of 12 upper and lower academic students each were randomly placed into three learning strategy treatment groups: Collaborative constructivist, Novick’s constructivist, and STAD. Students were given essay to tests their biological concepts understanding before and after treatment. The difference in students’ understanding and the gaps in understanding between UA and LA students were analyzed. The results showed no difference in students’ understanding if treated with Novick’s and collaborative constructivist. Differences in students’ understanding were found in the treatment of STAD. Students’ understanding was higher if treated with collaborative constructivist and Novick’s constructivist than STAD. Collaborative constructivist strategies can reduce the gap in students’ understanding and optimize gain in students’ understanding to the other two strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study is about the effectiveness of concept maps as a formative assessment. It aimed to investigate the effectiveness of concept maps in formative assessment for the teaching and learning of biological concepts at the secondary level. One group pretest-posttest quasi-experimental design was used for this study. The experiment was completed in six weeks. A sample of 46 students was selected from Karimabad District Hunza. Data were collected by conducting a Bioenergetics Diagnostic Test at each interval with and without intervention. It was found that concept maps are useful for the development of a clear understanding of concepts in Biology. Concept maps refrain from rote learning thus promoting critical thinking and reasoning ability and act as an effective classroom instructional and a formative assessment tool. It was concluded that the concept maps can be used as an effective formative assessment tool in Biology at the secondary level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article critically discusses the ecology of public schools in the United States: systemic barriers and associated biases that permeate these learning contexts and derail efforts to close opportunity gaps for African American adolescents with emotional and behavioral challenges. Using results from a mixed-methods study, we illustrate the ubiquity of an a-developmental perspective that guides perceptions of what is needed to keep these students in and successful at school. A close examination of school mental health providers' perceptions of what is important and feasible in public school contexts shows recommended interventions to be necessary but not sufficient. We highlight important considerations in the reframing of schools as a dynamic developmental system and conclude with recommendations about how to harness adolescents' strengths to generate strategies that move us toward more equitable and socially just schooling.

AB  - Scholars and researchers generally believe that scientific inquiry is an important activity for cultivating students' applied knowledge and high‐level thinking ability. The process of scientific inquiry can promote students' learning motivation and trigger their higher‐order thinking ability. However, students may not have enough prior knowledge or they may lack inquiry experience, which may influence the effectiveness of their inquiry learning. Besides, in a scientific inquiry environment assisted by technology, students must face abundant and diverse learning resources, and may not effectively organize and carry out advanced cogitation to solve problems. Therefore, this research proposed an integrated concept mapping and image recognition (IR) approach to help students effectively acquire and organize knowledge in the process of scientific inquiry. This study applied a quasi‐experimental design to verify the effect of this proposed approach. The experimental group conducted the concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach, whilst the control group conducted the conventional IR‐based learning approach to evaluate the students' performance in terms of their learning motivation and learning achievements. The participants were two classes of 10th‐grade students in northern Taiwan. One was the experimental group with 22 students, whilst the other was the control group with 22 students. The experimental results show that the students learning with the CM‐IR learning approach had better learning achievement, attitudes and intrinsic motivation, as well as higher mental load than those learning with the conventional IR‐based learning approach. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided for future research in this field. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicWith the development of information technology, AI has attracted the attention of researchers.Image recognition (IR) is one of the AI applications, and has been used to support learning in various educational fields.Researchers have indicated that concept mapping is an effective instructional strategy and promotes students' knowledge construction.What this paper addsA concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach is proposed to improve students' scientific inquiry performance.A quasi‐experimental design was conducted with 10th‐grade students on the 'Plant identification' unit of the scientific inquiry course.The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve students' learning achievement, learning motivation and learning attitude.Implications for practice and/or policyThe CM‐IR learning approach could be an effective method to facilitate students' learning performances and motivation in scientific inquiry.It is worth promoting the CM‐IR learning approach in school settings since it is low‐cost and enables learning anywhere using mobile devices.Scholars and educators are encouraged to work on how AI technologies applications can be applied to support learning.

AB  - Purpose: Libraries, museums and cultural centers have long served as cultural ambassadors and foreign policy instruments, bridging diplomatic relationships among nation-states and institutions. The purpose of this scoping review is to ascertain and understand the emerging areas of research on libraries, museums and cultural centers in foreign policy and cultural diplomacy within broader research paradigms of international relations, social sciences, education and library and information studies by systematically mapping key concepts and identifying the types of studies and knowledge gaps. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis, relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book chapters that were published over a wide time period in any language from various databases were systematically examined. Two reviewers worked independently to extract the data and reached a consensus regarding the inclusion criteria using the JBI's data charting template. Findings: In total, 6,436 citations were screened, and 57 documents were identified as eligible for inclusion. The following sequences were reviewed and explored: study characteristics, theoretical approaches and research themes. The research themes were grouped into broader ones that included goals, actors, strategies and instruments. Finally, the concentration and clusters of ideas and gaps that emerged in the identified studies were investigated, resulting in a discussion of the recommendations and directions for future research. Originality/value: This first scoping review is a useful tool for investigating the changing and novel roles of libraries, museums and cultural centers in cultural diplomacy and foreign policy. Although substantial work exists on the topic, the potential remains for interdisciplinary research to challenge and extend the current knowledge about cultural diplomacy practices in libraries, museums and cultural centers.

AB  - In undergraduate engineering, most of the subjects do not have the open visibility of the Industry and Research requirements. Students are interested mostly on subjects which are useful for Industry placement. They do not show interest in non-open visibility subjects if an instructor teaches by simply following the textbook. Considering this, we presented a concept map based teaching methodology with Research and Industry assignments and problems. The proposed methodology focus on improving the teaching quality and students understanding level. In this paper, we have taken the Compiler Design subject and presented the concept map. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed methodology, the students feedback was collected and evaluated using the sign-test and the students' submitted problems and assignments were evaluated to understand their level. The analysis results show that most of students studied Compiler Design with interest as a result of proposed teaching methodology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a valuable learning experience for a feedback provider. However, different types of products require different types of feedback, which, in turn, may lead to different learning outcomes. The current study investigates the effect on the learning of feedback providers of reviewing different types of products. Secondary school students (n =127) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: giving peer feedback on either concept maps or answers to open-ended test questions. Both types of product, created by the researchers, were comparable with regard to content: they included the same misconceptions and were both of average quality. Giving peer feedback was part of a chemistry lesson delivered in an online inquiry learning environment. Students' post-test scores, their own learning products, and the quality of the provided feedback were analysed to check for an effect on learning. There was no difference in post-test scores between the conditions, but the quality of the provided feedback predicted post-test scores. This indicates that it is not the type of product reviewed that matters, but the effort that students put into giving feedback. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explores teachers' conceptions of STEM education at the beginning of an online graduate course for practicing PK-12 teachers (n=20). A grounded theory approach was used to analyze open-ended survey data and concept maps. Teachers in the study interpreted STEM teaching from either a disciplinary or an integrated perspective. Their conceptions of STEM education within their concept maps fell into one or more of six categories: (1) utilitarian; (2) acquisition of disciplinary knowledge; (3) activities and resources; (4) access to meaningful problem-solving experiences; (5) advocacy for systemic change; and (6) buzzwords. This study reveals the complexity of teachers' conceptions of STEM education as they prepare to integrate STEM in their classrooms. The use of concept maps as a formative assessment can better position teacher educators and professional developers to move teachers toward a more sustainable integrated perspective of STEM teaching.

AB  - To evaluate the effect of the problem-based learning (PBL) teaching model combined with mind mapping on nursing teaching. The Cochrane Library, PubMed/MEDLINE, EBSCO, OVID, Science Citation Index (SCI), China Knowledge Resource Integrated (CNKI), VIP, WF and other databases were searched for studies published from 2000 to 2021 on the application of the PBL model in nursing teaching. Literature screening and data extraction were conducted by two independent evaluators based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, and heterogeneity was analysed. A meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software. A total of 1907 papers were initially retrieved, and 8 randomized controlled studies were eventually included in the meta-analysis after screening. Theoretical test scores, practical test scores, and students' self-learning ability in the experimental group were all significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05); however, practical test scores were highly heterogeneous (I 2 = 76%). The PBL teaching model combined with mind mapping works well for nursing teaching in China. It can improve students' self-learning ability, which is conducive to Chinese nursing students mastering theoretical knowledge and improving practical abilities, and can be affected by a variety of factors in practical teaching.

AB  - The perception of students in six (6) Southern Colleges of Education in Ghana on the use of web-based technology software for teaching and learning of biology was studied using 120 students. A questionnaire was used to collect data from the students on the perception they have about the use of web-based technology. The data from the questionnaire were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The findings revealed that the use of web-based technology instructional approach during lessons delivery and accessing the internet to search for information during instructional hours provided opportunities for students to access internet information at their own pace. It also came to light that the use of web-based instruction improved students’ understanding in biology concepts, stimulated students’ interest and thinking, and was not a waste of instructional time. The study revealed that students could use web-based software without any difficulties, the use of web-based instruction was not boring, the use of web-based instructions individualized learning and finally, the use of web-based technology for biology instruction was not time-consuming. Therefore, science tutors especially biology tutors should use web-based technology software for teaching and learning of biology concepts to make learning meaningful to students.

AB  - As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience specifically on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simplified complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

AB  - The current study was designed to analyze the curriculum of the teaching of social studies in the context of Castro & Galace Model of Peace Education (2010) (CGMP) applying the suggested framework by Levander & Mikkola (2009) about core curriculum using concept mapping framework (CMF). The concept map instrument was developed based on all three aspects of peace education. According to the concept mapping framework, the text was noted and explained. Experts' peer reliability was established through curriculum analysis by experienced experts. The analysis reflects that concepts of peace education exist in the curriculum in the context of the Castro & Galace Model of Peace Education (2010) and Peace Education is also presented in the learning activities. The analysis exposed that 9 aspects out of 9 of peace knowledge represented while 11 aspects out of 12 regarding peace values and 7 out of 8 aspects have representation. The unit wise analysis exposed that 4 units out of 6 (67%) regarding peace knowledge while 4 units out of 6 (67%) regarding peace values and 5 units out of 6 (83%) have representation of peace skills. It is recommended that Higher Education Commission (HEC) should revise the curriculum, design a separate course for peace education, give equal weightage to all aspects of peace education and manage cocurricular activities for B.Ed. (Hons) elementary 4 years program. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research used Novakian concept mapping and interview techniques to track changes in knowledge and understanding amongst students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards a laboratory science-based PhD. This detailed longitudinal case study analysis measures both cognitive change in the specific subjects that are the topic for research, and the understanding of the process of PhD level research and supervision. The data show the challenges for students and supervisors from different national, ethnic, cultural, and academic backgrounds and traditions with a focus on how this impacts the PhD research process and development. Working cross-culturally, and often in a setting different from either the student or the supervisor's background and training, can lead to a lack of common language and understanding for the development of a pedagogically oriented supervisory relationship. Documenting change in knowledge and understanding among PhD students and their supervisors is key to surfacing what the joint processes of mutual democratic research and of supervision may entail. This study explores how one of these key processes is a student's developing sense of belonging (or non-belonging). Specifically, this paper engages the concepts of belonging, and democratic education through mutual learning, to explore the practices of working across national, cultural, ethnic, and diverse academic backgrounds, for both supervisors and students. Doctoral study is understood as a situated context in which belonging also acts as a gateway for who can join the global scientific community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research study investigated conceptions about buoyancy held by 55 elementary preservice teachers enrolled in a science methods course who participated in an instructional intervention designed to increase their knowledge about buoyancy. Pre- and post-concept maps were analyzed using a paired sample t test and thematic analysis was used to interpret narratives, drawings, and interview data. There was a statistically significant difference (t = −3.504, p =.001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD =.879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The total number of accurate propositions increased between the pre- and post-concept maps. The drawings revealed that most participants (66%) had alternative conceptions about how gravity is related to buoyancy and the role it plays in floating and sinking. Data from the interviews triangulated with other data sources that showed gains in scientific conceptions such as opposing forces (53%) and surface area (33%), while documenting the persistence of serious alternative conceptions about floating and sinking (49%), the key role of fluid density (56%), and density of an object (62%).

AB  - Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students’ learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine. The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater than that of students who used the Google search engine. This illustrates that the agent effectively filtered computer science articles, and DACMs helped students gain a deeper understanding of academic concepts and knowledge related to artificial intelligence.

AB  - Creativity is widely described as a key '21st Century skill'. Science education in schools has emphasized the development of science inquiry and problem-solving skills with the support of technology, and paid insufficient attention to creative thinking skills for producing innovative ideas or solutions. This paper presents an exploratory study aiming to investigate how secondary school students engage in scientific creativity tasks with the support of technology, in particular how they generate ideas in small groups via applying relevant thinking strategies, engaging in social communication, and constructing a computer-based mind map to facilitate group thinking. The participants were 24 Grade 11 students from a high school, who worked on a set of scientific creativity tasks in 6 groups. Epistemic network analysis of group conversations reveals that constructing a mind map helped students to retain ideas for elaboration and evaluation, stimulate new threads of discussion, and regulate task progression. Compared to low-performing groups, high-performing groups engaged more in divergent thinking, mind mapping, and regulative discussions, in addition to making these activities more closely connected with idea generation. These findings have implications for the design of technology-supported educational interventions intended to promote and improve group creativity in science education. • We investigate how students generate ideas together via computer-based mind mapping. • Mind mapping helps retain thoughts, stimulate new ideas, and regulate discussions. • High-performing groups engaged more in thinking, mapping, and regulative discussions. • Mapping, thinking, and idea generation are more connected in productive discourse.

AB  - This study examined the effectiveness of metacognitive instruction on science learning achievement using a meta-analytic procedure. Statistical analyses were performed using the software Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA) Version 3 developed by Biostat, Inc. Based on the findings, the overall effect size (ES=0.808) revealed that the use and integration of metacognition in science instruction has a significantly large and positive effect on student learning achievement. Moderator analysis showed that there was a significant difference in the effect sizes of the individual studies when grouped according to the student's level of education and the scientific disciplines being studied. However, the obtained positive and large effect sizes suggested that the use and integration of metacognition can be effectively implemented whether students are in the elementary, secondary or tertiary level, be it Biological or Physical Science. Moreover, the metacognitive strategies employed by individual studies are mostly found to be integrated with ICT mainly metacognitive prompts; other practices were student-led metacognitive discussions, concept mapping, metacognitive writing, and metacognitive practice and training. This result establishes the effectiveness of the use and integration of different metacognitive strategies to improve student learning. Thus, science teachers must be equipped with pedagogical knowledge on the implementation and integration of metacognition in classroom instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The effects of Concept Mapping (CM) and Cooperative Mastery Learning (CML) strategies on students' attitudes towards biology were investigated in this study to instill a positive attitude in students toward biology. The study adopted a quasiexperimental, non-equivalent control group design with pre-and post-tests. A total of 449 senior secondary students (SS2) from Nyamagabe District, Rwanda was studied. Pre- and post-administration of biology Attitude Questionnaire (BAQ) with the reliability (a= 0.95) was used to obtain data. Mean, standard deviation, analysis of covariance, and Bonferroni test were applied for data analysis. The findings showed that students exposed to the CM and CLM strategies have a significantly higher attitude towards biology than those taught using conventional teaching methods (CTM) (F (2, 445) =26.717, p=.000<.05). There was no significant difference in mean attitude scores between male and female students who were taught biology using CM (F (1,148) =.635, p=.427>0.05) and CML (F (1,141) =. 670, p=.796>0.05). Also, the results showed no significant interaction effect of treatment and gender on the attitude of students towards biology (F (2,442) =.586, p=.557>0.05). The study concluded that the CM and CML are effective teaching strategies in raising students' attitudes towards biology regardless of gender. It is recommended among other things that biology teachers should adopt the CM and CML strategies during instruction to help students develop a positive attitude toward biology.

AB  - As healthcare continues to shift from hospitals to community settings, it is vital to prepare nursing students for community-based care, including home health. This exploratory descriptive qualitative study examined students' experiences with a home health escape room and their perceptions of how the experience affected their learning. To escape the simulated apartment residence, student teams solved three challenges related to fall risks, food insecurity, and polypharmacy. Sixteen baccalaureate nursing students participated in focus groups and thematic analysis was conducted. Four themes emerged: Being in the home and taking it all in ; Elements that maximized thinking ; Practicing and reflecting on teamwork ; and Using lessons learned. Simulated escape rooms offer a unique way to provide experiential learning to prepare students for home health clinical experiences. • Classroom learning was enriched by being immersed in the simulated apartment home. • Participants desired for another simulation to implement concept map interventions. • Including other health professions students would provide needed teamwork practice. • Participants felt more confident and prepared for home health clinical experiences. • Discomfort for addressing social determinants may stem from lack of experience.

AB  - This study investigates how 19 third-grade students developed their understandings of enslavement during a six-week social studies inquiry. Using Teaching Tolerance's key concepts as my analytic framework, I analyzed the students' pre- and post-concept maps and classwork to understand their learning. The findings show that students conceptualized enslavement as interactions between individuals—such as getting whipped by an overseer or forced to work by a master—but did not focus on the systemic nature of power and economic gain. Furthermore, students' sensemaking about race was limited to naming enslaved people as African Americans without naming the enslavers as whites. These results point to the need for critical inquiries on enslavement in elementary schools that explicitly focus on systemic race/ism and white supremacy. I provide implications to support antiracist teaching about enslavement in K–5 social studies education and teacher education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the extant literature of knowledge sharing (KS) and knowledge transfer (KT) in the small and medium enterprise (SME) context and to contribute with predictions of emerging themes. Design/methodology/approach: Applied is a systematic literature review using three bibliometric techniques: (1) textual analysis for keywords and abstracts to identify the research hotspots, (2) co-citation analysis of references to identify the evolution of KS and KT in SME and (3) bibliographic coupling analysis of documents to synthesize antecedents and outcomes. Findings: A conceptual map emerges from the review to reveal the antecedents of KS and KT at the individual, group and organizational levels. The analysis shows the strategic importance of KS and KT for the SME context. Specific findings include: (1) KS and KT are involved in enhancing SMEs strategic focus for human resources, including organizational learning, customer relations, creativity, higher profit and positive effects on operational processes and decision-making. (2) Innovation, trust and performance are identified as central human factors linked to KS and KT in SMEs. (3) Human resource (HR) management research could contribute to KS and KT in the SME domain by exploring KS- and KT-based practices, linking the emergence of innovation and innovative behaviors to these practices, leading to a better understanding of strategies that enable the long-term storage and retrieval of tacit and explicit knowledge as organizational memory in the SME context. Originality/value: This paper is one of the first to systematically review KS and KT in SMEs and propose a concept map. The research adds value to the growing literature of KS and KT and exposes the need for more specific activities to support SME managers, as well as HR managers, who need to facilitate KS and KT in SMEs.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Menthol cigarettes were banned in Ontario, Canada on January 1st, 2017. We used concept mapping, a mixed-method approach, to describe how menthol cigarette smokers quit smoking after the Ontario menthol ban.<bold>Methods: </bold>Pre-ban daily and non-daily menthol cigarette smokers who reported smoking abstinence 24 months after the ban (n = 62; 53.2% women; mean age = 43.6, SD = 12.5) generated statements describing reasons and strategies for smoking cessation/reduction after the menthol ban. Participants sorted a final list of 57 statements into groups of similar content and rated statements on how true each statement was for them and multidimensional scaling analysis identified thematic clusters.<bold>Results: </bold>Six clusters were identified: Mental and Environment Changes, Direct Ban Impacts, Health Reasons, Cues to Action, Family and Friends, and Cessation Strategies. The highest rated statements (i.e., most true) suggested many participants were motivated to quit smoking before or after the ban and 30.7% of participants believed the menthol ban helped with smoking cessation. Some of the lowest rated statements included using nicotine replacement therapy products, medication (i.e., Champix), or other tobacco products suggesting these strategies were less common. Statement ratings suggested many smokers quit without using replacement products or medication, but modifying cognitions and avoiding smoking cues were common.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The menthol ban aided some menthol smokers to quit, while others reported the ban did not play a role in smoking cessation. These data suggest the menthol ban had direct and indirect effects on smoking reduction behavior. Campaigns supporting similar bans that target both types of effects will likely be most effective for smoking reduction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students' vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students' vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes.

AB  - This study aims to determine pre-service teachers’ conceptual understanding of blackbody radiation. Designed as a qualitative study, it employed a case study design, which is one of the descriptive research methods. The study group consists of 18 pre-service physics teachers enrolled as seniors. An opinion form and a concept map were used as data collection tools. In other words, results were intended to be comparatively examined by using two different qualitative data collection methods. Pre-service teachers’ answers were analysed with the help of answer sculptures. At the end of the study, it was determined that while pre-service teachers generally have the correct conceptual structure, they still have some specific gaps in knowledge. It was seen that pre-service teachers have problems with understanding, especially the Wien law and electromagnetic radiation taking place in black-body radiation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research is developing the skills of students with mild intellectual disabilities using interactive map applications (Google Maps, Yandex Maps), determining how to implement the applications, and revealing the problems encountered in practice and possible solutions in detail. The research is designed in an action research model. The study group of the research consists of three students who were diagnosed with mild intellectual disability by the Counseling Research Center (CRC) and study in the special education class of a secondary school in Ankara. In the research, "Observation Form Concerning the Use of Interactive Map Applications" was used in the pre-application, post-application and permanence application. researcher’s diary, video and photograph records are other data collection tools used in the research. At the end of the study, the students' ability to use interactive map applications on the phone, computer and smart board was measured and it was determined that the students' skills were improved. The development of interactive map use skills of students with mild intellectual disabilities in social studies lessons contributed to the development of students' direction finding and map literacy skills. In addition, it has been observed that developing these skills contributes to the life skills of students as it increases their self-confidence and improves their abstract thinking skills.

AB  - In fact, due to the aspirational nature of NAEP Geography, the opportunity to learn is especially critical due to the content knowledge, understanding, and applications that NAEP assesses, and the sampling of student cohorts necessary to represent the general student population. Black/Hispanic minority students in the same schools and classrooms as White students, and presumably experienced the same content resources for learning, the same school personnel, and have access to school-based resources have very different outcomes. Within school NAEP Geography scores by minority students at the 8 SP th sp grade, with the exception of Asian students, have been consistently lower than White students. The National Assessment of Educational Progress in Geography (NAEP Geography) was a latecomer to the portfolio of national assessments that began in 1969 (assessing citizenship, science, and writing).

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts' concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9–16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students' knowledge more thoroughly.

AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question "Who am I?," was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of concept maps on the academic achievements of Biology teacher candidates and the elimination of misconceptions comparing the method with the traditional rote learning method. The quasi-experimental design, specifically, the pre- and post-test control group type was used in this research to address the research questions. The research was carried out with 60 Biology teacher candidates. Achievement test and diagnostic test were used as data collection tools throughout the research. SPSS version 20 software was used to analyze the obtained quantitative data. Independent samples t-test was used to determine, whether there was a significant difference between the control and experimental group students' level of prior knowledge regarding the subject of protein synthesis. The findings revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups in pre-test (p > 0.05). However, the findings revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups, in the post-test, in favor of the concept map method used for the experiment group (p < 0.05). The increase in the post-test scores of the experiment group students indicated that the teaching method based on concept maps positively affected the students' academic achievement and elimination of misconceptions. Research indicated that students could not establish a correct relationship between the concepts of DNA, RNA, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, nucleus, chromosome, gene, genetic code, codon, anticodon, translation, transcription, ribosome, protein, and amino acid terms taught in protein synthesis subject. It was concluded that the areas of use for concept maps should not be limited as a teaching tool, but should be further extended to for determining misconceptions, eliminating misconceptions, and evaluating the instruction.

AB  - Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) provide a novel approach to support teachers' structured professionalization and to assess improvement in teaching competence thereafter. Despite their novelty, it is important to assess EPAs as a construct to ensure that they accurately reflect the work of the targeted profession. The co-creation of an EPA framework for training and entrustment of small-group facilitators has been discussed in the literature. Although a rigorous design process was used to develop the framework, its content validity has not been established yet. Approach: A modified Delphi technique was used. Three survey rounds were conducted from December 2019 to April 2020. Expert health professions educationalists were recruited using purposive sampling and snowball techniques. In Round 1, a rubric consisting of seven items was used to assess the quality of nine pre-designed EPAs. In Round 2, competencies required to perform the agreed-upon EPAs were selected from 12 competencies provided. In Round 3, consensus was sought on sub-activities recommended for agreed-upon EPAs. Quantitative data were analyzed using multiple statistical analyses, including item-wise and rubric-wise content validity indices, asymmetric confidence interval, mean, standard deviation, and response frequencies. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using content analysis. Three of the nine proposed EPAs achieved statistical consensus for retention. These EPAs were: (1) preparing an activity, (2) facilitating a small-group session, and (3) reflecting upon self and the session. Nine of the 12 pre-determined competencies achieved consensus and were then mapped against each agreed-upon EPA based on their relevance. Finally, results indicated consensus on five, six, and four sub-activities for EPA 1, EPA 2, and EPA 3, respectively. The final framework delineates three EPAs for small-group facilitation and their associated sub-activities. The full description of each EPA provided in this article includes the title, context, task specification, required competencies, and entrustment resources. Program developers, administrative bodies, and teaching staff may find this EPA framework useful to structure faculty development, to entrust teachers, and to support personal development.

AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry‐based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game‐based inquiry‐based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem‐solving performances. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children's learning motivation and engagement of game‐based inquiry learning activities.Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles.Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming.What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach (ARG‐CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry‐based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums).Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs.ARG‐CMQ improved children's learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs.ARG‐CMQ might limit children's divergent thinking and influences their creative problem‐solving performance.Implications for practice and/or policy ARG‐CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry‐based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher‐order cognitive abilities.ARG‐CMQ can be used to support competency‐based education.

AB  - A crucial step in problem solving is the retrieval of already learned schemata from long-term memory, a process which may be facilitated by categorization of the problem. The way knowledge is organized affects its availability, and, at the same time, it constitutes the important difference between experts and novices. The present study employed concept maps in a novel way, as a categorization tool for chemical equilibrium problems. The objective was to determine whether providing specific practice in problem categorization improves student achievement in problem solving and in conceptual understanding. Two groups of eleventh-grade students from two special private seminars in Corfu island, Greece, were used: the treatment group (N = 19) and the control group (N = 21). Results showed that the categorization helped students to improve their achievement, but the improvement was not always statistically significant. Students at lower (Piagetian) developmental level (in our sample, students at the transitional stage) had a larger improvement, which was statistically significant with a high effect size. Finally, Nakhleh's categorization scheme, distinguishing algorithmic versus conceptual subproblems in the solution process, was studied. Dependency of problem solving on an organized knowledge base and the significance of concept mapping on student achievement were the conclusion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The writing process has helped define students as autonomous writers within the composition classroom. Yet, our writing identities are not stable and shift throughout the writing process. I argue that composition instructors should enhance students' awareness to their own dynamic, writing subjectivities through a more expansive view of rhetorical invention, using posthumanism as a lens for composition pedagogy. This article presents a pedagogical practice utilizing concept maps and reflective prompts that help students recognize their ecological, writing landscapes. By tracking the human and non-human elements in their writer's network, students can learn that writers operate within fluid, writing situations that continuously impact their writerly identities.

AB  - Collaboration is regarded as one of the core competences of the 21st century when it comes to complex problem solving. In response to high dropout rates among STEM students, we developed a digital-collaborative intervention on a difficult topic, MO theory, for first-year chemistry students. First, students work independently in a Digital Learning Environment (DLE). Afterwards, they collaborate in small groups and create Concept Maps on MO theory. We evaluate this intervention through knowledge tests, tests of attractiveness, cognitive load, and usability during the DLE and concept mapping process, as well as audio and screen recordings during the collaborative group processes. This paper presents the detailed study design together with results from a first study in January 2021, focusing on the practicability of the intervention and students' feedback. Overall, each small group succeeded in creating a Concept Map. Students rated all phases of the intervention as attractive, with high usability and low cognitive load, although the interactive videos scored better for attractiveness and usability than the concept mapping process. On that basis, first adjustments for a second cycle of the intervention, which will be conducted in January 2022, were derived. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept mapping (CM) can be an effective strategy to facilitate understanding-based learning of complex and abstract scientific content. In our study, we tried to answer two questions that have not yet been clarified: (1) How effective is CM if the learners do not have the textual learning material available when constructing their concept maps (retrieval setting) in contrast to when the material is available (elaboration setting)? (2) Do potential effects of the two settings depend on the intensity of a previous CM strategy training? To this end, we established a quasi-experimental four-group plan and collected data of N = 93 undergraduate students. The participants received either a detailed CM strategy training or just a short introduction and were then asked to apply CM in a retrieval or elaboration setting. The quality of constructed concept maps and content-related learning success were assessed to determine potential group differences. Overall, our results show a significantly positive but setting-independent effect of the CM strategy training on methodical CM skills. However, the different setting conditions differed neither regarding concept map quality nor content-related learning success, implying that CM in retrieval settings could be as effective as in elaboration settings.

AB  - Purpose: This article presents a case study exploring how future teachers combine scientific knowledge and practical knowledge during a history didactics course and practicum field experience in history teaching in Quebec high schools. Design: Through a thematic analysis of the written assignments submitted during the practicum and conceptual maps designed as part of the didactics course, links between theory and practice are highlighted. Results: Future teachers' referring to different types of knowledge depends on the expectations specified for each written assignment, and shows discourse with little critical distance. However, the concept maps show a more complex representation of teaching practices which can be explained by both the didactics course and the experiential and practical knowledge gained through the practicum. Implications: This composite of experiences puts initial teacher training into perspective along a continuum that requires consolidating university expectations and varying school practices. Closer collaboration is needed between the different actors involved in both theoretical courses and practical training. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Basic systems thinking skills are conceptualized through the DSRP model. • The SATL strategy promotes the development of basic systems thinking skills. • The SAQs can efficiently capture basic systems thinking skills. • The SATL strategy enhance deep understanding of chemistry cocncepts. • Chemistry understanding is related with basic systems thinking skills. The implementation of systems approaches and systems thinking has been considered as an important parameter for reforming chemistry education and practice. The "Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL)" strategy is a teaching-learning approach which is based on the development and use of cyclic concept mapping procedures, known as systemics, for teaching as well as for students' assessment, known as SAQs. The SATL strategy focuses on the enhancement of students' systems thinking skills, which are believed to enhance their understanding of relevant science concepts. The aims of this study were: (a) To investigate the effect of the implementation of the SATL strategy on 11th grade students' deep understanding of chemistry concepts, and (b) to explore the relationship between students' understanding in chemistry and the development of basic systems thinking skills. For this purpose, an experimental group, taught by the SATL strategy, was compared with a control group taught by a traditional linear approach, regarding students' chemistry understanding. For the intervention group, the relationship between students' understanding and their systems thinking skills was also explored. The results indicated that chemistry understanding of students taught by the SATL strategy was significantly greater compared to that of students taught by a traditional linear approach. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between students' deep understanding of chemistry concepts and their systems thinking level. This research provides evidence for a possible relationship between chemistry deep understanding and the development of systems thinking skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Prosocial behavior is a voluntary one with utmost intention to do for the benefit of others with set of actions in terms of helping others, sharing what ones have, donating to the needy one, co-operating and volunteering in all activities without personal gain. It is well known that teacher is not only pivotal center for the transformer of knowledge, character, value, but its play a vital role and model for the educand for developing all necessary qualities. The prosociality concept teaches us the nature of being kindness with others and the nature of existence of pros-sociality among the school teachers is need for shaping the educand in the present and fastest scenario. This concept and it values would be promoted among the students without compramisation at any cost. As a teacher, the investigator is very much anxious to know about how the present level of pro-social behaviour and its influencing factor which is enough to handle the students with techno atmosphere at the high school level. So a study is designed to conduct on prosocial behaviour to a sample of 250 participants as high school teachers who are randomly selected from Government high schools in Namakkal and Salem Districts of Tamilnadu, India through simple survey method. RameshChelvans' Pro-Social Behaviour Scale (2018) was five point scale, developed and validated by the investigator was employed to measure the pro-social behaviour with respect to educational qualification as demographic variable. The descriptive analysis revealed that the majority of the school teachers (55.20 %) have average pro-social behaviour. The differential analysis has shown that different levels of pro-social behaviour were found as determinant factor and educational qualification has no significant influence on the pro-social behaviour in total and it dimensions including behaviour towards students, colleagues, and family whereas significant influence on the behaviour towards work, parents, and towards society of high school teachers. It is very high time to promote and nourish this more valuable pro-social behaviour among the teachers through pre-service, inservice and internship programmes without delay. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is considered to be an effective teaching and learning strategy as it leads to longer retention of concepts learnt, improves problem-solving skills and enhances critical thinking. However, teachers often find it difficult to implement as they do not receive guidance during their initial training. A professional development intervention lasting four weekends was organised on developing rural science teachers' knowledge and skills in the use of PBL strategies for teaching circuit electricity. The aim of the study was firstly to explore how rural science teachers' knowledge and classroom activity change after the intervention and secondly to establish these teachers' experiences when implementing the strategy in rural schools. Three different instruments, i.e. open-ended questionnaires, interview schedules and a lesson observation protocol, were used to obtain qualitative data from 16 teachers in a total of eight purposively selected schools. The theoretical framework used was the social constructivist theory as it embeds the PBL strategy. Findings indicate that teachers indeed changed their teaching as learners made predictions, formulated hypotheses and were involved in thought-provoking activities. Rural teachers' experiences were similar to previous findings. However, these rural teachers had to additionally deal with the challenge of large classes and a lack of information technology support in the use of a PBL strategy. The divergence of the language of learning and teaching from the learners' home language was not found to be problematic. Not all teachers were qualified but according to the classroom observations they all displayed good content knowledge in circuit electricity, even when using PBL strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept Mapping (CM) is a learning strategy to organize and understand complex relationships, which are particularly characteristic of the natural science subjects. Previous research has already shown that constructing concept maps can promote students' meaningful learning in terms of deeper knowledge and its more flexible use. While researchers generally agree that students need to practice using CM successfully for learning, key parameters of effective CM training (e.g., content, structure, and duration) remain controversial. This desideratum is taken up by our study, in which three different training approaches were evaluated: a CM training with scaffolding and feedback vs. a CM training without additional elements vs. a non-CM control training. In a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learning outcome of N = 73 university students who each had participated in one of the trainings before. Our results suggest that an extensive CM training with scaffolding and feedback is most appropriate to promote both CM competence and acquisition of knowledge. From an educational perspective, it would therefore be advisable to accept the time-consuming process of intensive practice of CM in order to enable students to adequately use of the strategy and thus facilitate meaningful learning in terms of achieving sustained learning success.

AB  - Understanding the nature of science and scientific inquiry constitute foundation stones in scientific education in general and in scientific literacy in particular. Therefore, students must develop informed perceptions regarding science inquiry in order to be scientifically literate. The current study's purpose was to examine students' perceptions regarding science inquiry (SI). This would provide deep description of students' naïve and informed perceptions of SI, and also locate flawed thinking patterns regarding SI. The unique contribution of the research is expressed in both mapping the concepts about knowledge of scientific research in Israel and extracting and naming the concepts that the students have. The research population included 446 students in grades 7–8. This research chose a quantitative research approach. The study used a questionnaire called VASI (Views About Science Inquiry). This is a research questionnaire intended to diagnose students' perceptions regarding science inquiry. The study's findings indicate that most of the students do not develop informed understanding regarding the aspects of science inquiry. The aspects about which the students' have the most informed responses among the students are that the question motivates the inquiry and that the study's conclusions should match the data collected. The conclusion arising from the findings is that the students lack scientific perceptions regarding a significant proportion of the aspects of science inquiry, which raises the great importance of focused instruction of the aspects of science inquiry in class. Therefore, perhaps training teachers professionally to teach science inquiry directly in the classroom may develop the student's' scientific perceptions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Evaluate efficacy of a year-long local food sourcing promotional campaign on school nutrition programs' (SNP) use of practices. Previous research established the benefit of locally sourced foods including increased dietary quality and support of local economies. Prior research also identified barriers including lack of product availability, knowledge of regulations and personnel time. Convenience sample of 25 Oklahoma SNP administrators/managers. Multiple communication methods were employed during the 2018-2019 academic year to address perceived barriers to local food sourcing by SNPs. Methods included development and use of a fact sheet at 2 statewide SNP management training sessions, culinary chef consults and follow-up emails. Management-level personnel completed hierarchical concept maps before and after the school year assisted by a trained research assistant. Two base questions assessed 1) procurement methods used and food types purchased, and 2) perceived barriers. Secondary data provided school demographic information. At post-assessment, research assistants queried about number of local food sourcing campaign trainings/contacts received. Programs were self-operated (92%) and served grades K-12 (96%). Most were rurally located (60%), with <10,000 student enrollment (96%) and mid to high poverty (96%). There was no difference in local food purchasing by geographical location. At end-of-year, there was a 20% increase in the number of schools purchasing local foods. There was an increase in the number of food types purchased (P = 0.043, Cohen's d = 0.89). There was no difference pre to post in procurement methods used (P = 0.14) or perceived barriers (P = 0.056). The most often reported barrier was lack of product availability. This study demonstrated efficacy of a campaign to increase SNPs' use of local food sourcing. More work based on social-ecological and diffusion of innovation behavior change theories is needed to increase availability of product and address perceived cost/benefits to further expand diffusion of the practices.

AB  - Mental models are relevant in both managerial decision making and management education. Decision-making studies have demonstrated how managers benefit from more accurate mental models by gaining higher-quality heuristics and better performance. However, management education studies assessing mental models as learning outcomes remain rare. This study aims at understanding how students' mental models change during a business simulation course. We designed a pre- and post-simulation concept map assignment that illustrated students' mental models as number of concepts, connections between concepts, and written explanations. The findings of our study demonstrate that students' mental models changed through two interconnected processes: addition of new knowledge and change of misconceptions in existing knowledge. Based on these results, we composed a model of conceptual change through business simulation gaming. Our study contributes to the research on learning from business simulations and addresses the recent call for more conceptual change research in social sciences by enhancing the conceptual change discussion in the management education literature. • Our findings indicate two types of change in students' mental models: increased accuracy and addition of new knowledge. • The misconceptions or ambiguities in written explanations were most commonly related to the concept of profit. • Students' concept maps became more complex and informed about the causalities after the simulation.

AB  - The purpose of the current study is to determine pre-service primary school teachers' cognitive structure regarding communication, cooperation and decision-making skills, which are among the basic life skills addressed in the Life Sciences curriculum. The study employed qualitative research method. The study group of was composed of 111 pre-service primary school teachers taking the course "Life Sciences Teaching" at the Department of Primary School Teacher Training in a state university located in the Marmara region of Turkey. A word association test prepared to test the skills addressed in the current study was used as the data collection tool. This word association test focused on three of the basic life skills; communication, cooperation and decision-making skills. By examining the words written by the pre-service primary school teachers related to these three skills in a detailed manner, a frequency table showing how many times the concepts were repeated was prepared and on the basis of the cut-off points, concept maps were developed. As a result of the analysis, it was found that the pre-service primary school teachers produced a total of 154 concepts in relation to the three skills. When the concepts most frequently produced by the pre-service primary school teachers were examined, it was found that "human" was the concept most frequently produced for the communication skill, "group" was the concept most frequently produced for the cooperation skill and "reaching a conclusion" was the concept most frequently produced for the decision-making skill.

AB  - Retrieval practice enhances the learning of educational materials, and prior work has shown that practicing retrieval can enhance learning as much as or more than creating concept maps. Few studies have combined retrieval practice with other learning activities, and no prior work has explored whether concept mapping and retrieval practice might produce especially robust effects when the two activities are combined. In two experiments, students studied educational texts and practiced retrieval (by freely recalling the texts), created concept maps, or completed both activities. In the combined-activity condition, students studied and created concept maps prior to practicing retrieval. On a 1-week delayed assessment, practicing retrieval enhanced learning relative to creating concept maps. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping and retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit over retrieval practice without concept mapping, even though students in the combined condition spent substantially more time engaged with the materials than did students in single-activity conditions. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Can students benefit even more from retrieval-based learning if they first learn the material by using an elaborative study activity? To investigate this question, students read educationally relevant biology texts and then practiced retrieval by writing down everything they could remember from the text, constructed concept maps, or constructed a concept map before practicing retrieval. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping with retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit beyond retrieval practice alone, calling the alleged learning benefits of concept mapping into question.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the views of preservice science teachers on concept map use in a General Chemistry II class. The study was conducted with 47 preservice science teachers. In the study, an interview form grounded on determining their views on concept maps and comprised of open-ended questions, was used as the data collection tool. In analysis of the data acquired, content analysis was performed. As a result of the analysis of the data, the preservice teachers expressed positive views on concept map use. They stated that it might contribute to their learning and increase the permanence of the knowledge learned. Furthermore, they reported that they liked creating concept maps and among the concept map types they usually chose to create hierarchical concept maps. Most of the preservice teachers stated that they had to know the subject related to the concept map very well to create concept maps more easily, otherwise they might have a difficulty in the concept map creation process and thus concept maps should generally be used after a lecture. In addition the preservice teachers stated that they intended to use concept maps in their teaching experience. As a result, before concept maps are used in teaching, it is recommended to inform students about the creation of concept maps, to use them for re-purpose in teaching activities, and to include activities containing concept maps in textbooks.

AB  - The primary aim of this study is to investigate the impact of the self-efficacy beliefs (SEB) on academic achievement (CGPA) of high achieving school students in science subjects. Students' SEB means the self-confidence and ability to perform a given task or assignment. The Malaysian high achieving school students in the science stream were randomly selected to participate in this study applying the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to answer two research questions: 1) what is the relationship between the control of learning beliefs and SEB for learning of the high achieving school students in science stream? 2) What is the impact of SEB beliefs on the academic achievement of the high achieving school students in the science stream? The finding shows a considerable relationship between the variables of SEB and indicates the effects of SEB on science achievement significantly. The direct effect of control of learning beliefs on academic achievement was.51 while the direct effect of SEB for learning on academic achievement was also. 60 indicating that the SEB play an important role in the lofty attainment of the participants. In conclusion, educators should strategically maintain a high SEB of high achieving students to boost science attainment in the country [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As the Baby Boomer generation reaches old age, there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults needing healthcare over the past decade. The physiology of aging is therefore a highly relevant topic for the preclinical medical curriculum. I describe a new capstone unit on the physiology of aging, placed at the end a medical physiology course, to provide a vehicle for integration of prior learning about physiology of each individual body system. Students were provided with online selfstudy modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a "Review of Systems" predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The motivation for the design of this study was to understand the possibility and impact of the involvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals on school STEM education. This involved two stages, with the design of a set of authentic STEM inquiry activities firstly and implementation in primary classrooms secondly. Five teachers from a local primary school, who were making their first attempt in implementing STEM learning with students at senior primary levels, participated in this study. The teachers worked collaboratively with an Environmental Scientist with support from the research team to design authentic STEM activities to solve a problem which is currently affecting the school environment. The study used a qualitative approach with teachers' pre- and post- concept maps, self-reflections and interviews to capture changes in teachers' STEM conceptions. The findings showed that "School-STEM Professionals' Collaboration" had a positive impact on teachers' conceptions of STEM education and STEM professionals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Critical thinking is embedded in 2 dimensions, critical attitude and ability, which may or may not mutually affect students' self-confidence in science inquiry learning. To understand this issue, we designed a website called Enriched Thinking Cloud based on the predict-observe-explain (POE) model of inquiry-based learning by providing themes for students to learn about moon science concepts. Moreover, we calculated their critical performance based on object identification theory. Data collected from 163 participants were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling to test the prediction among paths of the research model. The results showed that attitude toward POE online inquiry learning can positively predict participants' self-confidence in using Enriched Thinking Cloud (hereafter "self-confidence") and can also predict their critical attitude. Furthermore, self-confidence and critical attitude can positively predict their cognitive dimension of the critical thinking process. The results suggest that science teachers can design more POE inquiry models to enhance students' critical ability and attitude in earth science learning. • The cognitive dimension of critical thinking and students' attitudes towards online science inquiry learning are evaluated. • Attitude towards POE online learning was positively correlated to self-confidence and critical attitude. • Critical attitude was positively correlated to self-confidence and the cognitive dimension of critical thinking progress. • Self-confidence was positively correlated to the cognitive dimension of critical thinking progress.

AB  - Higher-order thinking is crucial to inquiry learning. It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students' inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students' written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Giving and receiving peer feedback is seen as an important vehicle for deep learning. Defining assessment criteria is a first step in giving feedback to peers and can play an important role in feedback providers' learning. However, there is no consensus about whether it is better to ask students to think about assessment criteria themselves or to provide them with ready-made assessment criteria. The current experimental study aims at answering this question in a secondary school STEM educational context, during a physics lesson in an online inquiry learning environment. As a part of their lesson, participants (n = 93) had to give feedback on two concept maps, and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions—being provided or not being provided with assessment criteria. Students' post-test scores, the quality of feedback given, and the quality of students' own concept maps were analyzed to determine if there was an effect of condition on feedback providers' learning. Results did not reveal an advantage of one condition over the other in terms of learning gains. Possible implications for practice and directions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Today, science educators accept that digital literacy has been one of the key concepts for science teachers in terms of creating meaningful science learning environments. Although there are many research attempts investigating digital literacy in science teacher education literature, the interrelations of this concept to cognitive and metacognitive aspects are still blurred. In this regard, this study was conducted to investigate the structural relations among preservice science teachers' epistemological beliefs, self-regulated learning skills, and digital literacy as well as the reasons for these relations. A sequential explanatory research design guided this two-step study. The first step involved structural equation modeling analysis of data from 612 preservice science teachers. The second step focused on the reasons for the structural relations observed in the first step. Six participants were selected as the cases in the latter. Overall, the results showed that participants' epistemological beliefs, self-regulation skills, and digital literacy are closely related to each other. Epistemological and self-regulational filters as well as epistemic bias and the context in which the filters exist directly affect these relationships. Considering the results, it was suggested that preservice science teachers should be involved in inquiry-based and argumentation-based learning mediums since these types of mediums contribute positively to the development of epistemological beliefs and self-regulation skills.

AB  - Developing students' ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students' recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students' thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students' representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Employing scientific reasoning when giving biological explanations comes easily to the experienced scientist. However, students often encounter difficulty when they attempt to explain biological phenomena. One significant obstacle appears to be the failure or inability to bear in mind the levels of organization. To address this issue, learning strategies, such as the yo-yo learning and teaching strategy, recommend moving across the levels of organization and making those levels explicit in the explanation. To support yo-yo learning, we developed a new graphic organizer, the zoom map. The zoom map combines the levels of organization with concept maps. It is specifically tailored to guide students in biology on ways to distinguish, interrelate and reflect the levels of organization. In this paper, we introduce the zoom map as a tool for instruction and diagnosis. We also provide evidence from teaching experiments that demonstrate how the zoom map benefited learning.

AB  - Researchers have found that computer modeling fosters the learning of causal mechanisms in systems, an important crosscutting concept in science that many novice learners find challenging. Despite the research that highlights the role of teacher's instructional practices in enacting computer tools, few studies have considered teachers' use of computer modeling and its implications for student learning in classroom interactions, compared to interactions without computer tools. In this study, we examine (a) the impact of computer modeling on students' understanding of causal links in decomposition and (b) classroom interactions with use of computer modeling. We employed a quasi‐experimental design with eight middle school science classes that served predominately Latinx students. The random treatment was at the class level (computer modeling; n = 60, four classes) and control (paper modeling; n = 59, four classes). Analyses incorporated student preassessment and postassessment, classroom observations, and audio‐recorded modeling instruction. Results indicate that compared to paper modeling, computer modeling enriched systems thinking, particularly students' ability to provide causally coherent statements in explaining scientific ideas and evidence. Enactment of computer modeling may be associated with a shift in classroom interactions to include more invitation for students' elaboration of causal systems. We discuss aspects of computer modeling that may foster systems thinking, with implications for the future design of tools and curricula. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The elaboration phase provides evidence of students' developing knowledge as students are given an opportunity to devise a way to measure the diameter of a coin. Following are sample student responses: Collecting random samples estimating the length of the straw, we collected a sample size of 50 measurements. Understanding probability or chance, simply defined as the possibility of something happening, is essential for making life decisions and for developing science literacy. Probability is subsumed under cause and effect, an NGSS crosscutting concept that provides students with intellectual tools that are essential for identifying patterns in nature: Phenomena may have more than one cause, and some cause-and-effect relationships in systems can only be described using probability.

AB  - This study investigated the extent to which the proposed Factory of Ideas (FOI) teaching approach impacted on students' understanding of energy based on their prior knowledge. The FOI is a didactic approach that, unlike the classic cognitive conflict approach, employs a variety of activities to offer students a scientific conception for comparison with their own, and to expose students to several contexts in which the concept is applied. A total of 122 Grade 8 students participated in the study. A quasi-experimental research design with both a pre–post-test and a control and experimental group was employed. The control group (an intact class, N = 58) was taught using traditional teaching methods while the experimental group (an intact class, N = 64) was taught using the FOI teaching approach, which is underpinned by tenets of argumentation theory. The content-based pre- and post-test produced quantitative data that were analysed using SPSS. Based on the t-test comparing the mean scores of the two groups after the intervention, the experimental group was consistently found to outperform the control group on the correct understanding of energy concepts. Thus the FOI teaching approach impacted significantly on students' understanding of energy concepts. However, for some students, the FOI did not significantly change the students' use of alternative conceptions related to the law of conservation of energy. It is concluded that the FOI strategy is in general an effective teaching strategy, with the potential to facilitate learning of new scientific concepts, particularly if supported by a number of relevant science applications, and by laboratory and visual resources.

AB  - The current article addressed middle school (13–15 years old) students' science-related career awareness (SCA) and aimed to determine the effects of a longitudinal intervention, which focused on integrating career education into science teaching, using a pre- and post-test design. During the intervention, five teaching/learning modules (TLMs) were implemented in science lessons that enabled students to experience being (1) an electrical engineer, (2) a food technologist, (3) a forensic scientist or a civil engineer, (4) a team member of oil catastrophe simulation clean-up team, and (5) a customs' officer. Concept mapping was used to determine the changes in students' SCA. The suitability of this technique was validated through semi-structured focus group interviews. It was found that concept mapping enabled detection of progression in the intervention students' SCA among both boys and girls. The interviews provided valuable input on how students interpreted science-related occupations and relevant competences, when constructing their concept maps. An implication from this study was that SCA supportive teaching and learning modules or other similar teaching methods needed to be an inherent part of science teaching to support students making well informed decisions, either towards or away from science-related careers.

AB  - Recently, scholars have noted how several "old-school" practices—a host of long-standing scientific norms—in combination, sometimes compromise the credibility of research. In response, other scholarly fields have developed several "open-science" norms and practices to address these credibility issues. Against this backdrop, this special issue explores the extent to which and how these norms should be adopted and adapted for educational psychology and education more broadly. Our introductory article contextualizes the special issue's goals by overviewing the historical context that led to open science norms (particularly in medicine and psychology); providing a conceptual map to illustrate the interrelationships between various old-school as well as open-science practices; and then describing educational psychologists' opportunity to benefit from and contribute to the translation of these norms to novel research contexts. We conclude by previewing the articles in the special issue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In 2020, due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the education system passed a fundamental change. Both students and teachers had to acquire new skills in a world with access to a multitude of written or audio-visual information. The role of the teacher in the education process has changed. As his central role diminished, the teacher assumed the position of mentor. This position is reflected in the integration in lessons of modern learning methods that teach the student to use the information he can find from the comfort of his home. The paper presents the neuron, as a cell of the nervous system, an interdisciplinary subject, through interactive concept maps. The conceptual map is realized on two levels, on the first level being presented the nervous system, and on the second level the physical quantities characteristic of the nerve cell membrane and the calculation of their values. The electrostatics and electrokinetics of the nerve cell membrane and its equivalent wiring diagram are presented. By using interactive concept maps, the teacher can present the essential concepts punctually, being necessary to understand them in order to solve new situations in disciplines related to physics. The presentation in Microsoft Office Power Point 365, introduced in the concept map, contains a 3D model of the neuron from its own library of 3D models and has hyperlinks to a video from an online source and to the educational site Mozaweb with interactive 3D content adapted to home learning through maths and information technology.

AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step‐by‐step hints when conducting problem‐posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy‐five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP‐FL), students in Group B used the problem‐posing strategy‐based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP‐FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Flipped learning enabled teachers to have more class time to engage students in applying knowledge.Scholars have suggested that the value of flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinkingProblem‐posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking. What this paper adds: This study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning.A flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school.It was also found that the results showed that the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy was effective in terms of improving students' flipped learning performance, especially for those with higher levels of critical thinking tendency. Implications for practice and/or policy: Employing concept maps as a guidance for problem posing is a promising approach.It is worth investigating the impacts of the concept map‐guided problem posing approach on the students with different personal characteristics, such as knowledge levels or motivational levels.It is worth applying the approach to other courses in the future to further explore its effectiveness.

AB  - Background: Although the importance of directing students to career options in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields at early ages has been emphasized in the literature, it has not been clearly stated just who will play a role in this process and what kind of consultancy process will be followed. It is of great importance for prospective counselors, who are studying in the field of counseling, to master the career selection process, specifically for STEM, towards achieving the national goals. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate the career counseling competencies of prospective counselors who were participating in a STEM career maturity program. Findings: The current study employed the mixed-methods sequential explanatory design. In this design, after collecting and analyzing the quantitative and qualitative data, both datasets were then interpreted together. The quantitative data analysis revealed a significant difference between the post-test mean career counseling and performance indicator scores of the experimental and the control groups (u = 49.00; P < 0.05). The career counseling and performance indicator mean rank and sum of mean scores of the students in the experimental group were higher than those of the students in the control group. The mean career counseling and performance indicator scores of the students in the experimental group increased after the experimental application (Z = – 3.07; P < 0.01). Moreover, the effect size was also calculated and determined to be 0.58. As a result of the analysis of qualitative data, 4 themes were established, comprising (1) personal and professional development, (2) awareness of the STEM majors and careers, (3) STEM-focused career counseling, and (4) feedback about the program. Conclusions: This study found that the STEM career maturity program that was designed and implemented herein resulted in positive impacts on the career counseling competencies and performance indicators of the participants, as well as their knowledge and awareness of professional STEM areas. Considering the role of school counselors in supporting students in choosing STEM careers, this newly proposed STEM career maturity program will provide a strong model for supporting pre-service and in-service school counselors in directing students towards STEM fields, so as to develop a qualified workforce in STEM fields, which is one of the main objectives of the STEM education reform.

AB  - The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the effect of the problem‐based learning (PBL) on science attitudes of middle school students from low socio‐economic status families. For this purpose, two intact classes of the same teacher were randomly assigned as experimental and control groups. In the unit of genetics, the experimental group was taught by PBL while the control group received traditional instruction. Students' attitudes were measured in terms of adoption of scientific attitudes, enjoyment of science lessons, and career interest in science administering a self‐report instrument as a pre‐test and a post‐test. Results showed that after the treatment, although there were not statistically significant differences between two groups with respect to attitude toward science; in the experimental group, the mean scores were found to be consistently higher across all attitude dimensions compared to the control group. In addition, the mean scores suggested an improvement in the attitudes of experimental group students from pre‐test to post test. Qualitative findings also revealed that students found PBL enjoyable. According to PBL students, searching for information and writing reports were among the features of the PBL contributing to their learning the most. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study with the intention of answering the question: can an intentionally structured online environment stimulate and enhance the processes of mutual interaction and hybridization between digital artefacts and analogic artefacts (books) so as to encourage the development of significant learning in students? This research, carried out in the academic year 2018/2019, involved 183 Italian students enrolled on the bachelor's degree in Primary Education Sciences at the University of Salerno attending the course "School experimentation and educational planning". The data were collected by working out and using an information retrieval questionnaire and four different tests. The virtual interaction space was e-LENA, the Learning Management System of the RIMEDI@ research lab. The experimental results highlight how this methodology, called DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) by the authors, has had effects in terms of reducing study time and improving learning outcomes. The online learning environment stimulated to study in greater detail with a book, with the learner being able to restructure and systematize his own knowledge. The DMRA valorises the active role of the learner during his process of knowledge construction and may have significant implications for educators who would like to use innovative and effective online learning environments to enhance student learning. • This paper presents the synergistic use of Dynamic Concept Maps (DCMs) in online learning environments. • DCMs are able to stimulate in students the processes of mutual remediation between digital artefacts and books. • DCMs encourage the development of significant learning. • DCMs favour a more efficient organization of learning in terms of reducing study time. • DCMs are effective in terms of learning outcomes.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the effect of using McGraw-Hill Education (MGHE) Connect on students' academic performance. It examined the effects of MGHE Connect on the course letter grade, pass rate, retention rate, total score, and final exam score in addition to the proportions of having more A and B grades in the course. The study used a posttest-only control group design. The 95-student sample was selected by sampling four sections using a simple one-stage cluster method. Then two sections were randomly assigned as a treatment group (N=45), in which using MGHE Connect Chemistry was required to complete course assignments, quizzes, and tests, and the other two assigned as a control group (N=40) in which students completed the course conventionally. The study used ordinal logistic regression, binomial logistic regression, and multiple linear regression. The study indicated that when controlling the effect of students' CGPA, there was no significant difference in the odds of having higher letter grades between the experimental treatment and control groups. Also, the experimental group did not significantly have a higher proportion of A and B grades compared to the control group. The course pass rates and the retention rates in both groups differed insignificantly. The total course score and the course final exam score did not differ significantly. The study findings of students' academic performance metrics in the study indicating no statistically significant positive effect of the MGHE Connect on the student academic performance.

AB  - Scaffolds are considered to be a promising method of supporting learning. In this study, we investigated the learning efficacy of scaffolds in an inquiry-based learning scenario. Three tasks posed a question/problem to facilitate inquiry-based learning, and scaffolds offered the answer/solution in multiple steps (so-called incremental scaffolds). The use of the scaffolds was voluntary and students' learning efficacy was compared with a traditional teaching approach. A total of N = 105 seventh graders participated in the quasi-experimental study. Incremental scaffolds were available to the students in the treatment group. Students in the control group received the same question/problem but could only ask the teacher about the answer/solution. Concept maps were used at pre- and posttest to assess conceptual knowledge acquisition. In-line with our hypothesis, results show that students in the treatment group outperformed controls concerning conceptual knowledge acquisition. Regarding the number of misconceptions students used, there were no differences between the groups. Our study indicates that incremental scaffolds are an appropriate method to provide students with the exact help they really need. Based on our findings, we offer practical implications and recommendations for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Feedback providers learn more from commenting than from grading peer's work. • Low prior knowledge students may benefit the most from commenting. • The quality of students' own concept maps predicts their post-test scores. In peer assessment, both receiving feedback and giving feedback (reviewing peers' products) have been found to be beneficial for learning. However, the different ways to give feedback and their influence on learning have not been studied enough. This experimental study compared giving feedback by writing comments and by grading, to determine which contributes more to the feedback providers' learning. Secondary school students from Russia (n = 51) and the Netherlands (n = 42) gave feedback on concept maps during a physics lesson. The lesson was given in an online inquiry learning environment that included an online lab. Students gave feedback in a special Peer Assessment tool, which also provided assessment criteria. Findings indicate that post-test knowledge scores were higher for students from the commenting group. The difference between the groups was largest for the low prior knowledge students. Possible educational implications and directions for further research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over 40 years of research, concept maps have shown that they are beneficial for learning. However, much of this research has been conducted in laboratory settings. Although there are a few studies conducted in the classroom, there is little understanding of the instructional efficacy of using different types of concept maps. In a between-subjects design, the present study investigates the effects of learning chemistry in a large undergraduate classroom with three concept mapping activities: static, fill-in-concepts, and fill-in-labels. Students reviewed a static map or completed a fill-in-the-blank concept map. Results show that students studying static concept maps outperformed those who engaged with the fill-in-the-blank concept maps. Further, prior knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of learning performance. Additional findings show that the accuracy of completing partial concept maps mediates the influence of concept map format on learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is widespread evidence showing that concept maps are effective for learning. However, little is known about the effects of various concept map activities. We conducted an experiment to examine the comparative effectiveness of three concept map activities: (i) translating a complete map to a paragraph format, (ii) filling in concepts in a partial map, and (iii) filling in labels in a partial map. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general chemistry course were randomly assigned to the three groups. Each concept map depicted the relationships between concepts on the topic of reaction enthalpy. Results showed that the map-translation group significantly outperformed the fill-in-concepts and fill-in-labels groups in conceptual understanding indicated by open-ended questions while there were no significant differences among the three groups in conceptual understanding indicated by multiple-choice questions.

AB  - Introduction: Accurate clinical decision‐making of dentists should be based on their knowledge and experience. In the past 10 years, interest in competency‐based dentistry education has rapidly increased, but there has been little attention paid to methods of improving dental education competency. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical presentation education model that provides opportunities for students to practice problem‐solving from the moment they greet the patient so that students can obtain the practical experience of competency‐based education and the effectiveness of this model can be confirmed through pilot test. Methods: This article is divided two parts: First, developing the clinical presentation dental education model (CPDEM) and Second, a pilot study adopted CPDEM. To confirm the effectiveness of this model, the students' satisfaction, their perception of self‐achievement were analysed. Results: Clinical presentation dental education model has been developed to provide practice‐related education experience and provide linkage between basic science and clinical science. The result of applying this education model to 10 students as a pilot test was shown an overall high satisfaction level. In addition, self‐achievement students' reported of all intended competencies was higher than for non‐participating students of this model. Conclusions: This study focuses on practical education centring on clinical presentation. This model could get a meaningful and realistic experiences through the practice using clinical presentation of patients, use their metacognition for organizing and memorizing the patient's case by using concept map. It can be used as a future instructional method to enhance students' competency. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Despite an increasing academic attention towards both gamification and competencies-based education, little is known about Higher Education teachers' beliefs regarding the use of gamification to develop students' competencies. To fill this research gap, concept mapping was used to cluster teachers' beliefs in 4 dimensions regarding the use of gamification to develop students' competencies. Our findings suggest that teachers believe that gamification encourages team working and oral communication skills. Moreover, critical thinking and social skills development were also found as some of the benefits that teachers believe the use of gamification can provide to the development of students' competencies. These findings should encourage both Higher Education teachers and policy makers to increase the use of gamification-based programmes to develop students' competencies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps are used to assess and improve prospective teachers' conceptual understanding levels. In this research, the aim was to describe prospective science teachers' conceptual understanding of the atom by using concept maps. The research employed the case study approach, one of the qualitative research patterns. The research group consisted of 15 fourth-year prospective science teachers. The concept maps drawn by the participants were used to describe their conceptual understanding of the atom. For data analysis, the descriptive analysis method, one of the qualitative analysis methods, was used. The data obtained from the concept maps were divided into the categories previously defined by the researcher. The created categories were evaluated by two academics with expertise in physics education, and a correspondence analysis was conducted. As a result of the research, it was concluded that prospective teachers could establish successful and meaningful propositions in concept maps, however, most of the propositions were collected in the categories of "meaningless," "improvable," or "acceptable.".

AB  - The objective of this study was to identify what competencies are identified in the literature as necessary for Industry 4.0 by conducting a survey of the literature and a scientific mapping of the evolution of the issues related to the qualification of professionals for Industry 4.0 and possible paths for research and education. A search was conducted on the Scopus, Web of Science and Science Direct databases for the interval from 2010 to 2018. This systematic review revealed topics and authors currently specialized in the field and allowed mapping the field of study. The identification of journals and keywords useful in future studies was also an object of this study. SciMAT software was used for the systematic literature review. The results are highlighted by the set of competencies (knowledge and skills) that must be developed in professional education to accompany the new industrial revolution, as well as the importance of integrating efforts by companies, governments and universities. These efforts should focus on creating "learning factories", which are understood to be environments that provide practical experiences to these professionals, preparing them in the best way possible for the requirements of Industry 4.0. This conceptual map showed that the main competencies needed include skills: (leadership, strategic vision of knowledge, self-organization, giving and receiving feedback, pro-activity, creativity, problem solving, interdisciplinarity, teamwork, collaborative work, initiative, communication, innovation, adaptability, flexibility and self-management) and knowledge of contemporary fields (information and communication technology, algorithms, automation, software development and security, data analysis, general systems theory and sustainable development theory). • Systematic Review of the Literature (SLR) using SciMAT software. • The manuscript presents a new approach on the training needs of future professionals in manufacturing systems. • It's proposes a set of skills (knowledge and skill) that must be developed in professional education for the new industrial revolution. • The integration efforts between companies, governments and universities for the creation of learning factories is presented.

AB  - The active learning literature has greatly expanded over the past few years. This article investigates the utility of employing concept map activities in a medium-sized class, and whether or not it improves students' learning and retention of material. We find that concept mapping activities significantly enhance students' mastery and recollection of class material. The size of the effect is considerably greater in our treatment group, relative to our control group. We discuss the advantages of this specific active learning technique, and offer suggestions for its incorporation into different institutional settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Learning metabolic pathways is vital for understanding biochemical processes and all of their implications for life. Their learning in the virtual environment is complex and generative learning strategies, such as the construction of online conceptual maps, can help in this process. This article presents a proposal for the collaborative construction of virtual concept maps on metabolism by students in the CMap Cloud browser application (free). A sequence of steps is suggested, which include online group brainstorming and discussions, peer assessment, and teachers feedback. This proposal is flexible and can be adapted to the didactic and technological reality of each teacher. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept‐maps are widely used to assess students' conceptual understanding in different subject areas. Conventionally, it is mostly built maps which are assessed. In this study, we explore if "concept‐mapping" could be used as a case for constructive alignment of both the process and the outcome of learning. Specifically, we have studied how a simple measure of looking at the order in which concept map elements‐concepts (cards, C), links (arrows, A), and linking phrases (phrases, P)‐ are placed on the working space reveals information about the quality of the final generated map. We report findings from analysis of the concept‐mapping process in two separate groups of university students (N = 38 (18 + 20)) who were asked, individually, to build concept maps related to two separate concepts in biology and chemistry respectively. We found that, across both groups, students consistently followed the same order of element placement that they began with and found significant differences in the quality of eventual maps resulting from students' map building strategies. Our results suggest that the quality of students' concept maps depends considerably on the strategy used to build it, and point to the supplementary role that the physical working space of the concept‐mapping exercise offers to students' own working memory as a possible explanation for these quality differences.

AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real‐world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers' concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers' ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi‐directional peer‐assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system can not only increase students' learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment.

AB  - This 2-group quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the following research questions: Do the fourth graders' post-intervention scores achieved in the unit of force and motion achievement test and attitude scale toward the unit depend on being in the groups that were taught the unit either with =Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material' (ONACOM) integrated PBL and with ONACOM-integrated EL when we control for their respective pretest scores and their science grades in the previous semester? What are the students' gains, achievement, attitude and retention from the two systematic applications of the ONACOM-integrated methods, PBL and EL? The sample (N=220) consisted of fourth graders at public elementary schools in Burdur, Turkey. Although there were no significant treatment effects favoring one of the methods, teaching science topics by integrating ONACOM consistently in both methods increased the students' achievement and attitude levels and supported their knowledge retention with large effect sizes significantly. As well-developed innovative software, ONACOM is effective on learning regardless of the course and method when it is systematically integrated into teaching methods, since it is prepared on the basis of multimedia learning strategies and is suitable for the essential structures of both teaching methods.

AB  - Concept mapping instructional strategy is one of the innovations in the teaching and learning of science and biology in particular. Previous studies have reported that teachers and students experienced difficulties in the use of concept mapping. Hence, this study investigated the effects of Concept-mapping instructional strategy on senior secondary school students' achievement and retention in biology in Lagos, Nigeria. Quasi-experimental research design was adopted for the study. The population comprised all senior secondary school two biology students. Two intact classes of SS II students were involved in the study. The research instruments used were Biology Achievement Test (BAT) and Concept-Mapping Based Lesson Plan (CMBLP). The reliability of the instruments was 0.75 and 0.82 respectively. Three research questions with corresponding three hypotheses guided the study. Analysis of Co-variance (ANCOVA) statistical tool was used tested the hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The results of the study showed that: (i) the experimental group performed better than the control group, that is: concept-mapping affects students' achievement and retention; and (ii) there was no gender influence on students' achievement. Based on results, it recommended among others that teachers should be encouraged to adopt the use of conceptmapping instructional strategy in teaching senior school biology. Also, male students should be encouraged to better their achievement and retention just like their female counterparts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article seeks to describe the implementation of a problembased learning (PBL) teaching-learning method in a university classroom. The aim is for the student through given real-life situations to acquire knowledge, abilities, and attitudes in the subject of electrical machines in the undergraduate electrical engineering program of the Catholic University of Cuenca. Solving problems related to static machines will be similar to the problems that students will face in their professional lives; namely, to be able to identify a static machine and its operation, parameters, model its equivalent circuits (open- and short-circuit tests), calculate losses, and carry out hysteresis loop measurement. Most of these concepts are abstract and challenging for students to assimilate. Therefore, the present research shows how using the PBL model in studying static machines improves the academic performance and achievement of students in an experimental group. There was an improvement of 7 points out of 100 in relation to the average of the grades of three groups of students from previous semesters. Also, the standard deviation is lower in the experimental group (SD 4.5584), which shows that most of the students improved in their performance. Finally, there was no failure of the study year nor remedial exams among this group. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Learning clinical reasoning skills in nursing education is a challenge for teachers and students. This study investigated the effects of a blended learning program on the acquisition of clinical reasoning skills via a blood transfusion course. The study employed a two group randomised controlled design with an experimental group (group 1, 16 students) and a control group (group 2, 16 students) recruited from a population of second-year nursing students at the Mohamed VI University of Health Sciences in Casablanca, Morocco, during the 2018-2019 academic year. The experimental group received blended instruction, while the control group received traditional classroom instruction over four sessions. One month after the experiment, a post-test was conducted with both groups using 'key-feature questions' that included four clinical situations and 30 questions. The mean scores of the two groups were compared to assess the degree of acquisition of clinical reasoning skills. The mean post-test score was significantly higher in the experimental group than the control group (the p-value of the Mann-Whitney Test is less than 0.05). Moreover, a statistically significant correlation was detected between students' clinical reasoning scores and their theoretical examination marks. These results suggest that blended learning is useful for enhancing the clinical reasoning skills of nursing students, at least in the short term. Thus, it seems appropriate to develop more blended courses and integrate this approach into nursing education programs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics' teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics' conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education.

AB  - Cognitive learning is gaining momentum in the world of education. This study aims to prove that 'Brain-Targeted Teaching Model (BTT) is an effective teaching technique that helps students improve their perceptive skills and become more creative. Hardiman (2012) initiated this method at The Johns Hopkins University, USA. The methodology used is the BTT model, a pedagogical framework, that seeks to connect research and practice by providing instructors with a cohesive structure of effective instruction based on the neuro-cognitive sciences. The findings highlight that the six targets help educators combine many elements related to research-based teaching and associate each component to what neuroscience reveals about how a human brain learns (Hardiman, 2003). The results shed insights into how the teacher has to change her attitude towards students and have a better understanding of their minds and emotions in establishing a positive relationship.

AB  - • Human trafficking prevention is of critical importance in social sciences and yet there remains a significant dearth in the emperical literature. • A final 10-cluster solution provides a burgeoning prevention framework built upon rigorous multi-level mixed methods analyses.. • This study is the first of its kind, including survivors of human trafficking in conceptualizing human trafficking prevention and data organization. • This study meets national and international calls for research which is empirically sound in the field of human trafficking. • This study supports the anti-human trafficking movement in the inclusion of survivors,bringing valuable insight, experience and knowledge to research and practice. The purpose of this study was to explicate a conceptual framework for the prevention of human trafficking from the perspective of those most impacted: human trafficking survivors. In doing so establishing an empirical foundation for human trafficking prevention research. To achieve this aim, researchers employed Group Concept Mapping (GCM). GCM is an integrated, mixed-method, research design that analyzes qualitative data via quantitative approaches, namely multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses. All participants (N = 35) identified as human trafficking survivors from one of four states in the United States. Results indicate that survivors in this sample conceptualize prevention via a 10-cluster solution. Furthermore survivors rated the cluster on Education and Awareness (9) as the most Important (4.60), as well as the most Feasible (4.28). This paper will review extant literature related to human trafficking, explicate results from this study, and discuss pragmatic prevention implications related to findings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Social networks provide traditional concept mapping of new opportunities for concept construction with grouping, social interaction, and collaborative functions. However, little effort has been made to explore the effects of social network–supported concept mapping compared with traditional individual concept construction. This paper explores the effects of social network–supported group concept mapping (SCM) activity and compares them with the effects of individual concept mapping (ICM) activity. A platform named CoCoing.info (http://cocoing.info) is utilized to examine the SCM and ICM activities under three studies, which drove the following research questions: (1) Do map structure (i.e., propositions, hierarchies, examples, cross-links, and scores) and mapping activity (i.e., map modification period and frequency) differ between ICM and SCM in students on specialized courses? (2) Do map structure and mapping activity differ between ICM and SCM in students on general education courses? (3) What are the effects of group size on SCM? In study I, four classes are selected to ensure a strong social network learning environment control. On the basis of study I, study II extends the controlled environment within an open social networking environment with a total of 1106 SCM maps and 569 ICM maps to produce an improved overview of concept mapping. The findings of studies I and II are consistent, demonstrating that the students constructed more comprehensive concept maps and had a higher modification period and frequency with SCM than with ICM, which indicates that in a social network learning environment, SCM is favorable to ICM. Study III considers each participant's contributions to identify an optimal group number. The results of study III indicate that groups with two to seven members perform better than larger groups. Overall, the findings demonstrate the benefits of integrating concept mapping with social networking for student learning outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous research on computer programming advocates that most computer science students, especially novices, lack programming competencies. The reasons given for this inadequacy is that most students lack the background knowledge, first experience of programming, and a new environment of writing programs in a syntax specific language, and so forth. Due to these reasons, the failure rate is high every year. Several researchers have used learning taxonomies; in that, Bloom's taxonomy has been widely used for assessment and learning of programming. Moreover, Bloom's taxonomy has been used as a scale for preparing the assessment questions, and the competency level was quantified based on that. In contrast, this study proposes a novel approach of programming assessment, in which the achieved competency level of a student is mapped to the respective cognitive levels of Bloom's taxonomy directly from the written code with no prior mapping of questions. The computation of the competency level in terms of mapping to the respective cognitive level is based on some principal criteria extricated from theories used in previous studies. Furthermore, this study emphasizes the basic topics of the structure programming course: Selection, repetition, and modular. The data collection was carried out from 213 students using an empirical test that is further analyzed through Structural Equation Modeling. The results show that Bloom's taxonomy is a beneficial tool for learning and assessing programming. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in the worldwide disruption of teaching and learning in main stream schools and in institutes of higher learning. Singapore was not spared. With the closure of schools in early April, it was imminent that the delivery and assessment of our freshman general chemistry course must be overhauled for the new semester. While the delivery of Home-based Learning (HBL) was a challenge for all educators, it was a mammoth roadblock for chemistry courses because of laboratory classes. Besides being thrusted to learn and use new technology tools for online lessons, instructors also had to quickly explore and design alternative assessments to substitute in-person written examinations and tests. This paper documents the struggles that played out in the decision to implement concept map assessments and "split-half" laboratory classes for safe distancing. Although these interventions are not novel, we confronted tensions as we sought to address academic integrity, administrative guidelines, and our own inadequacy particularly in concept map assessments. In light of positive and negative feedback from both staff and students, lessons were drawn to enhance future implementation and for further research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The affective domain and its impact on science achievement has been studied with increasing attention over the past decade. However, there has been little empirical work on how individual interest, and facilitation of situational interest in the classroom, facilitates learning of concepts within fine-grained units of instruction. Drawing upon previous theoretical and empirical work, we test the hypothesis that individual interest facilitates situational interest, and that this in turn facilitates content learning, with respect to a 10-day health education intervention focused on teaching middle school students about light, color, and vision. We found that individual interest in science facilitates situational interest in the classroom activities and the teacher's instruction, and that situational interest has a positive and significant effect on learning concepts related to light and vision. Our data suggest that facilitating situational interest is a requirement if individual interest and prior knowledge are to be effective scaffolds for conceptual learning. However, targeting of other affective traits like motivation and engagement or cognitive processes like goal setting may be necessary to fully harness students' interest toward effective scaffolding of learning.

AB  - This article addresses the demand for global content knowledge that the process of internationalization has placed on the preparation of social studies teachers. Drawing on scholarship about global perspectives in teacher education, this study examined what one cohort of preservice teachers learned about globalization during participation in a three-week, web-based, international relations simulation. The unit was part of a methods course designed to prepare preservice teachers to teach global issues and internationalize the curriculum. International simulations have long been touted as a means for learning challenging knowledge about global issues yet are rarely studied in teacher education. This qualitative study drew on concept maps and written responses completed before and after the simulation to document the preservice teachers' learning. The analysis generated two findings: (1) preservice teachers acquired a shared, conceptual vocabulary for globalization that included the events and actors represented in the simulation; and (2) they also demonstrated a more systematic and critical understanding of the ways that power and conflict shaped the events and actors. The study contributes to the question of what teachers need to know to teach with global perspectives and how efforts to internationalize teacher education programs can foster such knowledge.

AB  - Safe, effective and ethical clinical decision-making in nursing depends on critical thinking, yet there is no consensus on the educational strategies that are most effective in developing and refining this foundational skill. A qualitative inquiry among graduating Bachelor of Science in Nursing students sought to determine whether one such educational strategy, an operationalized critical thinking framework, would assist nursing students to better understand acute care patients' complex profiles. The Safe Care Framework™, consisting of the 'Concept Map Template' and the 'Priority Setting Tool Template', was developed using a constructivist pedagogical approach. The framework illustrates and operationalizes the systematic critical thinking processes that expert nurses use to provide safe, comprehensive care. Thematic analysis of qualitative survey results revealed the following three main themes; (1) greater organization and understanding of patient data; (2) guiding of assessments and priorities of care; (3) better communication with others, and several subthemes. Thus, the Safe Care Framework™ may be a practical operational tool that can support novice nurses in developing critical thinking skills. This framework adds to the literature on innovative pedagogy for nurse educators. • The Safe Care Framework ™ is an innovative pedagogy for critical thinking. • Greater organization and understanding of complex acute care patients. • Guiding of assessments and priorities. • Better communication with others. • Cognitive support for novice nurses to understand complexity.

AB  - The aim of the present research was to explore the use of concept maps as an assessment tool. The research question posed was: can concept maps be used to quantitatively assess the learning of a physics topic in an engineering course? This paper describes a new approach to quantifying concept maps. The research was preceded by a pilot project that allowed the necessary processes for the proper conduct of the research to be developed. The sample comprised 47 first-year engineering students who were asked to construct a concept map about the content of electrostatic interactions. The concept maps the students prepared were valued quantitatively and qualitatively by an expert instructor. To validate the approach, an analysis of the relationship between the scores given in the three evaluation forms was made. A comparative statistical analysis of the multiple-choice examination data with the quantitative and the qualitative evaluations of the concept maps found not only that there were no significant differences between them in either case, but also that they were moderately, but significantly, correlated. These results suggest that we are on the right track to obtain an effective and easy-to-use tool to evaluate the students' learning results based on the quantitative assessment of the conceptual maps elaborated by them. Moreover, the analysis of the concept maps in the pilot stage allowed the difficulties that the students had during their learning to be detected, which led to the sequencing of the content of the electrostatic interactions topic being changed.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of simulation-based instruction on students' greenhouse effect achievement. The simulations were chosen from the Physics Education Technology Project (PhET) website. The research was a pretest-posttest with a control group design quasi-experimental study. The sample of the study consisted of 45 6th grade students taking a science course in a secondary school from a city located in the Central Anatolia Region of Turkey in the 2017-2018 academic year. Participants were assigned randomly to control and experimental groups. There were 23 participants in the experimental group and 22 participants in the control group. While the control group was instructed with the constructive instructional methods, the experimental group was instructed by PhET simulation-based instruction over 1 week. Data were collected by the Greenhouse Effect Achievement Test. Independent samples t-test and paired samples t-test were used to analyze the data. The study results revealed that the PhET simulation-based instruction created a statistically significant difference between the control group and the experimental group in the students' greenhouse effect in favor of the experimental group (p = 0.03).

AB  - This study looks at the educational experiences, from the preschool years to advanced professional training in STEM fields, of a targeted sample of 10 (7 male, 3 female) early college entrants in China who later became professors at prestigious USA research universities. The purpose of the study was to find out (1) what some identifiable endogenous factors were about these individuals that facilitated the success of their accelerated learning and development; (2) what kinds of exogenous factors (e.g., environmental opportunities, resources, support) they experienced from childhood to adulthood that enhanced the successful acceleration experience; and (3) how these endogenous and exogenous factors facilitated their developmental transitions every step of the way, especially from the role of a student to that of an aspiring scientist. These questions are addressed in light of evolving complexity theory. Retrospective interviews were used for data collection. Thematic analysis of the codes from interview data yielded a conceptual map. A distinct set of endogenous and exogenous factors at different developmental junctures were identified, and their dynamic interplay was delineated to account for accelerated trajectories toward a scientific research career. The theoretical significance and practical implications of the study for talent development in science are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - During the university term, in addition to graduation, some Brazilian science undergraduate students have the opportunity to join Scientific Initiation Programs (SI). Students are expected to be able to develop scientific writing skills. Based on these goals, this descriptive study aimed to investigate the efficacy of practical activities for SI students on the topic of the structure of scientific articles, using a qualitative approach via a case study. Five female students, who were aged between 20 and 30 years and enrolled in a Food Engineering undergraduate course, participated in the study. The students attended two meetings. In the first, texts that dealt with the structure of scientific articles were distributed, followed by a scientific bingo game. The second meeting focused on the creation of concept maps. The activity methodologies used allowed the SI students to remember their previous knowledge about the subject and generate new knowledge. The association between the two activities provided a better understanding of the subject. It was concluded that educators should seek new ways to introduce the understanding of topics that are part of the student's daily life and that practical activities usually generate a positive result because they are dynamic, interactive, and undertaken in groups.

AB  - Colleges and universities continue to work toward innovative high-impact learning experiences to promote informed citizenship. Pedagogical research highlights the value of both interdisciplinary teaching and community-based participatory research (CBPR) in undergraduate civic development. Yet, research is limited in examining undergraduate student learning outcomes employing both pedagogical approaches. Utilizing mixed methods (i.e. surveys, concept maps, and focus groups) this study investigates the student learning outcomes of an interdisciplinary course (political science and criminal justice, community psychology, and social work) consisting of a CBPR project to inform local policy surrounding homelessness. Findings highlight student growth in the domains of: 1) interdisciplinary collaboration (applying an interdisciplinary lens and resolving diverse perspectives), 2) transference of course knowledge to real-world application, 3) critical consciousness building (specifically, critical reflection), 4) civic development, and 5) increased self-awareness. Finally, this paper highlights implications regarding course development, lessons learned, and future assessment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As medical schools have changed their curricula to address foundational and clinical sciences in a more integrated fashion, teaching methods such as concept mapping have been incorporated in small group learning settings. Methods that can assess students' ability to apply such integrated knowledge are not as developed, however. The purpose of this project was to assess the validity of scores on a focused version of concept maps called mechanistic case diagrams (MCDs), which are hypothesized to enhance existing tools for assessing integrated knowledge that supports clinical reasoning. The data were from the medical school graduating class of 2018 (N = 136 students). In 2014-2015 we implemented a total of 16 case diagrams in case analysis groups within the Mechanisms of Health and Disease (MOHD) strand of the pre-clinical curriculum. These cases were based on topics being taught during the lectures and small group sessions for MOHD. We created an overall score across all 16 cases for each student. We then correlated these scores with performance in the preclinical curriculum [as assessed by overall performance in MOHD integrated foundational basic science courses and overall performance in the Clinical and Professional Skills (CAPS) courses], and standardized licensing exam scores [United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)] Step 1 (following core clerkships) and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (at the beginning of the fourth year of medical school). MCD scores correlated with students' overall basic science scores (r = .46, p = .0002) and their overall performance in Clinical and Professional Skills courses (r = .49, p < .0001). In addition, they correlated significantly with standardized exam measures, including USMLE Step 1 (r = .33, p ≤ .0001), and USMLE Step 2 CK (r = .39, p < .0001). These results provide preliminary validity evidence that MCDs may be useful in identifying students who have difficulty in integrating foundational and clinical sciences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving. Studies of the usefulness and psychometric properties of the new assessments are needed with different groups and in different contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps were created as one of six measures to identify exceptionally talented students during the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM (CDTIS) project, with the goal of identifying and nurturing talents in students from groups traditionally underrepresented in special programs. New methods were compared with conventional methods to select students for an internship in the laboratories of scientists. In this article, we describe development, field testing, and implementation of the concept map assessments in life and physical science. Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: unknown, maybe, probably, definitely, and wow. The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t (41), p >.38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study analyzed the impact of different analogical learning approaches (analogies or metaphors) integrated with different presentation modalities (pictures or texts) on middle school students' learning performance of electricity with supporting evidence from their eye movement behaviors. Eighty ninth-grade middle school students were randomly assigned into four groups to receive four different versions of an online electricity learning program, including pictorial analogies, textual analogies, pictorial metaphors, and textual metaphors. Data regarding students' eye movement behaviors were collected simultaneously during their online learning. All the students took a pre-test, post-test, and retention test covering their comprehension of electricity concepts. Our results revealed that the analogy group provided more mapping and integration behaviors between the analog and target concepts about electricity, resulting in gaining better performance than the metaphor group. Additionally, students receiving pictorial modality generated more mapping and integration behaviors between the analog and target concepts, resulting in a better understanding of electricity concepts than students learning with textual modality. The associated implications for analogical learning approaches and presentation modalities concerning science learning and eye movement behaviors are also discussed in the paper.

AB  - Drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) Model, this study aimed to determine the key variables that facilitate the acceptance of mobile learning in two Middle Eastern countries (Saudi Arabia and Iraq), as well as identifying the constructs that can help enhance learners' motivation. A conceptual framework was proposed based on a modified UTAUT2, wherein trust was integrated, and new relationships were assumed among the proposed Model variables. Data were gathered using an online questionnaire from 469 higher education students of Computer Science. The collected data were analyzed with partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling and multi-group analysis (MGA) techniques. The results suggest significant differences in learners' perceptions from both countries. It was found that although some variables were significant in one country, they were not in the other and vice versa. Overall, the proposed framework explained 56.1% and 40.7%, respectively of the variance of behavioral intention and hedonic motivation among the Saudi sample (N = 246), and 51.1% and 41.9%, respectively of the variance of behavioral intention and hedonic motivation in the Iraqi sample (N = 223). These research outcomes are significant for educational institutions as they could help policy-makers better understand the issues facing mobile learning acceptance in terms of cultural similarities and differences. Accordingly, new strategies could be formulated to ensure improved mobile learning uptake. • Mobile learning has received less consideration in Saudi Arabia and Iraq. • The variables associated with the acceptance of mobile learning show the viability of the research framework. • New relationships have been confirmed to explain students' hedonic motivation for mobile learning. • Price value was a predictor of behavioral intention and hedonic motivation amongst Iraqi students only. • Trust significantly affected behavioral intention and hedonic motivation in both countries.

AB  - This study used a systematic review and meta-analysis as a method to investigate whether STEM enactment in Asia effectively enhances students' learning outcomes. Verifiable examples of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, effectively being applied in Asia, are presented in this study. The study involved 4768 students from 54 studies. Learning outcomes focused on the students' academic learning achievement, higher-order thinking skills (HOTS), and motivation. The analysis results of effect sizes showed that the STEM enactments in Asia were effective at a moderate level (0.69 [0.58, 0.81 of 95% CI]) of improving students' learning outcomes. Sequentially, the effectiveness of STEM enactment starts from students' higher-order thinking skills, moves to students' academic learning achievement, and ends with the motivation. In addition, STEM enactments in Asia were carried out with several variations where STEM integrated with project-based learning was preferred. The recommendations of this study include a combination of the learning approach, learning orientation, and duration of instruction, all of which contribute to the STEM enactment effectiveness and maximize results in STEM education. Some practical implications, such as the central role of the teacher during the STEM enactment, are extensively discussed. This study supports that STEM education is a universally crucial tool which effectively prepares students from various national and cultural backgrounds, across Asia, toward improved learning outcomes.

AB  - This study introduces issue concept maps (IC map) as an instructional tool for exploring students' idea about socio-scientific issues (SSI). By visualizing students' ideas in two dimensions, context and occurrence, IC maps represent what kinds of ideas students have on the issues, and how their ideas change and connect. In the study, we implemented a SSI program on fine dust for 77 seventh graders and used IC maps to investigate how their ideas changed after the program. Students collaboratively constructed IC maps in groups before and after the program. Results show that the number of ideas written on IC maps significantly increased after the program from 92 to 254 ideas, indicating that the program contributed to enhancing students' awareness about the issues in terms of its causes, effects, and countermeasures at various context levels. Students also presented a greater variety of types of connections among their ideas after the program. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Remap RT (Reading - Concept Mapping - Reciprocal Teaching) learning model on low-ability students' achievement in biology. This quasi-experimental research made use of a pre-test-post-test non-equivalent control group design. The population of this research was 125 tenth-grade students from the Natural Science classes aged around 16 years old. Four classes were randomly selected as the samples, and they were divided into two groups: two classes belonged to the high ability classes, and the other two were categorised into the low ability groups. The students' achievement was measured using an essay test. The results of the test were analysed using ANCOVA. The findings indicated that 1) students who learned using Remap RT had better academic achievement in biology than students who learned using a conventional method; 2) students with high academic ability had better academic achievement than students with low academic achievement; and 3) low-ability students who learned using Remap RT and high-ability students who learned using a conventional method had equal academic achievement. The results of the research suggest that Remap RT was effective in improving lowability students' achievement in biology. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Glavni cilj raziskave je bil preučiti učinke učnega modela Remap RT (branje - oblikovanje konceptov - vzajemno poučevanje) na uspehe dijakov z nizkimi dosežki v biologiji. Ta kvazieksperimentalna raziskava je uporabila zasnovo s predpreskusom in popreskusom iz neekvivalentne kontrolne skupine. V raziskavi je sodelovalo 125 dijakov desetega razreda iz naravoslovnih razredov, starih približno 16 let. Štirje razredi so bili naključno izbrani v vzorec in razdeljeni v dve skupini: dva razreda sta sodila v skupino z visokimi dosežki, dva pa v skupino z nizkimi dosežki. Dosežki dijakov so bili testirani z vprašanjem esejskega tipa. Rezultati testa so bili analizirani z uporabo ANCOVA. Ugotovitve so pokazale, da so: 1) dijaki, ki so se učili z uporabo Remap RT, dosegli boljše akademske dosežke v biologiji kot tisti, ki so se učili s konvencionalno metodo; 2) dijaki z visokimi dosežki na akademskem področju uspešnejši kot dijaki z nizkimi dosežki; 3) dijaki z nizkimi dosežki, ki so se učili z uporabo Remap RT, in dijaki z visokimi dosežki, ki so se učili s konvencionalno metodo, imeli enake akademske dosežke. Izsledki raziskave kažejo, da je bil model Remap RT učinkovit pri izboljšanju dosežkov dijakov z nizkimi dosežki v biologiji. (Slovenian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The flipped learning approach has been growing in popularity in both higher education and K-12, especially for its potential to increase active learning and student engagement. However, further research is needed to understand exactly how the flipped approach enhances student engagement. This narrative systematic review synthesises literature published between 2012 and 2018, focused on the flipped learning approach in K-12 contexts, and indexed in 7 international databases. 107 articles, book chapters, dissertations, conference papers and grey literature were included for review, and the results are discussed against a bioecological model of student engagement. The results indicate that the majority of research has been undertaken in North American and Asian high schools, heavily focused on student perceptions of flipped learning and achievement within STEM subjects, especially Mathematics, with a slight preference for quantitative methods. Studies in this review found the approach to overwhelmingly support student engagement, with 93% of studies citing at least one dimension of behavioural, affective or cognitive engagement, whereas 50% of studies reported facets of disengagement. Collaborative technologies such as Google Docs, Google Classroom and Edmodo were particularly linked to engagement, with videos not created by teachers more likely to lead to disengagement. Only 12% included a definition of student engagement, and less than half used a theoretical framework. Future empirical research should ensure that all contextual information is included, including year level of student participants, that multiple methods of both quantitative and qualitative data collection are included, and close attention is paid to grounding research in theory. Further research is needed on parent, teacher and school leader perceptions, as well as longitudinal and multiple-class studies. • 93% of studies found at least one engagement dimension & 50% at least one disengagement dimension. • Most found indicators: Increased interaction, enjoyment, participation & confidence. • Collaborative LMS/tools particularly improve engagement in flipped learning. • Teacher-created videos are more likely to lead to task completion & overall engagement. • More research needed on parent, school leader & teacher perceptions.

AB  - Mathematics has been, is and will remain a fascinating topic. Learning mathematics using modern means of information technology, pedagogical approaches specific to 21st century challenges, are issues that will be treated in this article. We live in an era of information explosion, accelerated and revolutionary technical progress, which is why it is imperative to ask questions, assess risks, modify methodologies, concepts and create new learning situations. It is our responsibility to prepare for the future, which today means the class of students / students, instilling in them patterns of attitudes and behaviors, transmitting the knowledge needed for a world in a continuous change worldwide. Software solutions in eLearning imply the existence of a complex system of teaching and learning online, through advanced technologies (laptops, smart phones, tablets, eLearning platforms, internet), offering access, at different levels of study, according to the users needs. Experimental mathematics continues to gain increasing importance in the engineering sciences, in this regard, computerization and simulation play increasingly important roles, providing clarity and accuracy in the technique of teaching-experimenting-evaluation. The Gergonne - Euler - Soddy triangle is a broad subject, for which we propose in this article the analytical and graphical treatment of the determination of the coordinates of NOOBS points and of the equation of GERGONNE's straight line, and through specialized software a graphical application is developed, highlighting their unique characteristics and properties, in Euclidean geometry. The graphical modeling of the triangle ABC, of the inscribed circle and its points of tangency with the sides of the triangle, was performed with Graph 4.3 software. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - With the developing technology educating students free from misconceptions, making sense of their learnings and using them in daily life are primarily aimed. This research is designed not only for teaching "work, energy and power" concepts and the relationships among them but also for investigating the effects of the teaching on students' achievements under the POE method. 6 students from the 9th grade studying at a private Anatolian High School chosen through easily accessible case sampling method, constituted the sample. 4 data collection tools (semi-structured interview, open-ended achievement test, concept map and concept cartoon) were applied. It was carried out within the scope of a single group pretest-posttest simple experimental study, a quantitative research method. For analyising the data, gap and content analysis methods were used. Thanks to the interviews, open-ended achievement test and concept map, as pre-tests, it was determined that students had many misconceptions about "work, energy, power" concepts and didn't have any scientific knowledge about the relationships among them. The students' drawings on these relationships were also far from scientific. After the concept teaching under POE was performed, the data collection tools were re-applied as post-tests. So, it was seen that students' misconceptions were largely eliminated by replacing them with scientifically-correct concepts and relationships as a result of that process. In the light of these findings, applying POE method in concept teaching on different classes, courses or subjects is higly recommended. Some suggestions are also made for the researchers wishing to work in this field. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps make connections between ideas apparent, and thus would seem ideally suited to demonstrate learning. Yet, they are not widely used by instructors, particularly in large university classes. In this paper we review the strengths and rationale behind concept maps and provide examples we have used to structure content for one of our introductory courses. A rubric that focuses on propositions was used to grade student-created concept maps on a final exam administered to 293 students. These grades are compared to those of multiple-choice questions, short answers, and an essay on the same exam. We find poor correlation between concept maps and the other instruments, and stronger correlations between short answers and multiple choice, as well as between short-answer content grades and essay writing grades. We speculate that concept maps may be less influenced by student language skills and short-term memory than written answers, and that concept maps should be used as an alternative assessment of higher-order thinking skills.

AB  - Many methods have been developed for managing groups in active learning classes, but little research has been done on the effect of group structure itself. Results are presented for an active learning physics class in which half of the class was placed in academically homogeneous groups while the other half was in heterogeneous groups. Students were given the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism as a pretest and posttest, and also filled out surveys on their experiences in their groups. The study was intended to be continued for three years, but was terminated halfway through the second semester as the evidence had become sufficiently compelling that placing half of the class in academically heterogeneous groups was placing them at a significant disadvantage. Student feedback, pretest, and posttest data indicated that low- and middle-performing students benefitted the most from academically homogeneous groups. Results for the one full semester of the study and the rationale for discontinuing are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today's schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants' correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to measure the role of mind mapping in learning models to improve students' metacognitive skills. The study used a preexperimental one group pre-test post-test design, involving 33 students of science teacher candidates, Science Education Study Program, Universitas Negeri Malang, Malang, Indonesia, for three meetings. The instruments used were a mind map assessment rubric and a metacognitive skills essay questions as many as 15 questions alongside with its assessment rubric. Students were given a pre-test before learning activities and the same post-test consists of essays related to metacognitive skills. Research data were analyzed descriptively and quantitatively using a t-test and correlation analysis. The results showed: (1) there was increasing scores over mind mapping skills in the average by each meeting, namely score of 13.91 (Enough), 15.39 (Enough), and 18.18 (Good); (2) the paired t-test results showed the value of t = 9.196, with a significance of 0.000 <0.05; and (3) the results of the influence analysis of 0.552 showed that mind mapping with metacognitive skills was correlated by moderate criteria. To conclude, the mind mapping applied in the syntax of learning models can improve the metacognitive skills of students as science teacher candidates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to promote scientific literacy among sports majors who were not interested in learning about science via a course called Addressing Macroscopic Issues in Biochemistry and Sports (AMIBAS). The participants were 54 students majoring in sports at an Indonesian university. Using a 1 group pre–post study design, students were required to participate in 2 consecutive biochemistry courses—conventional course and the AMIBAS course. The first part involved conventional teaching prior to administering a pretest, and AMIBAS was conducted in the second part, after the pretest. The 2 parts were conducted during two 7-week periods for 4 h a week. Data analysis results showed that the scientific literacy levels of 56% of the students rose from a nominal-functional level (pretest) to a conceptual-multidimensional level (posttest). Students' attitudes toward biochemistry also became more positive. The students were able to macroscopically explain biochemistry-related issues. However, they were unable to describe issues microscopically, due to a lack of preexisting biochemistry knowledge, mental habits oriented toward macroscopic thinking, and inadequate science communication. Sharing, feedback, and discussion can scaffold students' learning and help them to explain biochemistry and sports-related issues in more scientific terms, change their habits of mind, and become more scientifically literate.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine college students' conceptions of learning computer science and approaches to learning computer science and to examine the relationships among these two important constructs and possible moderating factors. Student data (N = 193) were collected using the conceptions of learning computer science and the approaches to learning computer science surveys at one public research institution in the southeastern United States. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics, Confirmatory Factor Analysis models, internal consistency reliability, Pearson correlations, stepwise multiple regression models, and Multivariate Analysis of Variance models. The results suggest that college students most favorably employ a deep strategy approach for learning computer science in which prior knowledge is activated and meaningful learning strategies are used. College students appear to be more extrinsically motivated to learn computer science than intrinsically. Higher level learning conceptions are associated with a deep strategy approach to learning (e.g., Seeing in a new way) whereas low-level conceptions are associated with a surface strategy (e.g., Memorizing) approach to learning. Male college students have slightly higher conceptions of programming than their female counterparts. The findings are discussed and both limitations and delimitations of the study are enumerated.

AB  - We report on seven secondary science teachers' initial efforts to understand and enact NGSS-aligned teaching. After interviewing and observing them over the course of the school year, we found that teachers revised their lessons to include instructional strategies that aimed to meet the demands of the NGSS. Yet at times, the purpose for which teachers used these strategies were misaligned with the demands of the NGSS. This suggests that appropriately supporting teachers during this time of science education reform must include opportunities for them to consider their own instructional goals in relation to the goals and demands of the NGSS. We present the strategies and goals identified from interviews with the seven teachers and the observations of their classroom teaching in order to illustrate the professional learning needs of the in-service science teachers in this study.

AB  - The study aimed to investigate the relationships between student-centered teaching approach, problem-based learning, and academic achievement in science teaching. The quantitative quasi-experimental research approach was adopted in this study. The data of the study was collected by a structured questionnaire. The sample of the study consisted an experimental group students (N= 215) and a control group students (N=204) by cluster random sampling. The results showed a significant difference in the student-centered teaching approach, problem- based learning, and academic achievement scores for experimental and control group of students. It is found that there is a low positive correlation between student-centered teaching approach and academic achievement, although there are significant differences between the experimental and control group. The study revealed that there is a medium positive correlation between problem- based learning and academic achievement, although there are significant differences between the experimental and control group. At the same time, it is revealed that the total variance of academic achievement levels explained by the student-centered teaching approach and problem- based learning is relatively a high percentage.

AB  - Background: Literature describing the effectiveness of teaching strategies in the clinical setting is limited. This realist synthesis review focuses on understanding the effectiveness of teaching strategies used in the clinical setting. Methods: We searched ten databases for English language publications between 1 January 1970 and 31 May 2017 reporting effective teaching strategies, used in a clinical setting, of non-procedural skills. After screening, we used consensus to determine inclusion and employed a standardised instrument to capture study populations, methodology, and outcomes. We summarised what strategies worked, for whom, and in what settings. Results: The initial search netted 53,642 references after de-duplication; 2037 were retained after title and abstract review. Full text review was done on 82 references, with ultimate inclusion of 25 publications. Three specific teaching strategies demonstrated impact on educational outcomes: the One Minute Preceptor (OMP), SNAPPS, and concept mapping. Most of the literature involves physician trainees in an ambulatory environment. All three have been shown to improve skills in the domains of medical knowledge and clinical reasoning. Discussion/conclusions: Apart from the OMP, SNAPPS, and concept mapping, which target the formation of clinical knowledge and reasoning skills, the literature establishing effective teaching strategies in the clinical setting is sparse.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the effect of using argumentation and problem-based learning approaches on the development of environmentally responsible behaviours among pre-service science teachers. Experimental activities were implemented for 14 weeks for 52 class hours in an environmental education class within a science teaching department. A mixed method was used as a research design; particularly, a special type of Concurrent Nested Strategy was applied. The quantitative portion was based on the one-group pre-test and post-test models, and the qualitative portion was based on the holistic multiple-case study method. The quantitative portion of the research was conducted with 34 third-year pre-service science teachers studying at a state university. The qualitative portion of the study was conducted with six pre-service science teachers selected among the 34 pre-service science teachers based on the pre-test results obtained from an environmentally responsible behaviour scale. t tests for dependent groups were used to analyse quantitative data. Both descriptive and content analyses of the qualitative data were performed. The results of the study showed that the use of the argumentation and problem-based learning approaches significantly contributed to the development of environmentally responsible behaviours among pre-service science teachers.

AB  - This article presents the results of a qualitative study aimed at determining the effectiveness of the camera obscura as a didactic tool to understand image formation (i.e., how it is possible to see objects and how their image is formed on the retina, and what the image formed on the retina is like compared to the object observed) in a context of scientific inquiry. The study involved 104 prospective primary teachers (PPTs) who were being trained in science teaching. To assess the effectiveness of this tool, an open questionnaire was applied before (pre-test) and after (post-test) the educational intervention. The data were analyzed by combining methods of inter- and intra-rater analysis. The results showed that more than half of the PPTs advanced in their ideas towards the desirable level of knowledge in relation to the phenomena studied. The conclusion reached is that the camera obscura, used in a context of scientific inquiry, is a useful tool for PPTs to improve their knowledge about image formation and experience in the first person an authentic scientific inquiry during their teacher training.

AB  - In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles of non-relativistic theory. The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of undergraduate textbooks, and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties. The answer consists of seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed to account for the results of measurement and time evolution. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets of the interplay between the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables, and to highlight the educational significance of the relations between observables. The maps can be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure and by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While this framework may be adapted to different approaches and interpretive stances, it provides indications in favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - "Didn't understand or not fully understand" is the most common situation that students experience when they learn medical biochemistry and molecular biology (MBMB). Therefore, the primary task of teaching MBMB is to help students overcome the difficulties in "conceptual understanding." The core of the solution to these problems lies in the acquisition and application of cognitive skills. The key to applying Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory (A's CAT) is to expand the knowledge capacity of students' cognitive structure through the purposeful "production" and employment of advanced organizers, with which students can replace "rote learning" with "meaningful learning" and ultimately develop an interest in MBMB courses. The results showed that the application of A's CAT did not only encourage the students to use cognitive skills to learn and understand MBMB knowledge and overcome the barrier to learning that results from the characteristics of the MBMB course, but also expanded and deepened the MBMB course contents. As a branch of learning theory, A's CAT provides practical methods for the several hypotheses of learning theory. Among these, the advanced organizer strategy realizes the organization and reorganization of new knowledge; the progressive differentiation strategy reduces the difficulty of complex and abstract knowledge; the implementation of the advanced organizer strategy and integrative reconciliation strategy forms the concept map. Taken together, the application of A's CAT includes cognitive strategy and metacognitive strategy when the cognitive process is conducted in a meaningful way. More importantly, application of A's CAT guides students to participate in active learning and builds "scaffolding" for the teaching/learning MBMB of student‐centered goals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The literature indicates that the use of mobile devices, wireless communication and sensing techniques can enhance students' learning in authentic environments and improve their learning effectiveness. Good learning strategy guides are essential for successful inquiry learning, and the question-posing strategy has been acknowledged as a type of high-level cognitive strategy that plays an important role in facilitating students' knowledge integration in the inquiry learning process. However, question posing seems challenging for many students and may lead to heavy cognitive load when appropriate scaffolding is not available. To solve this problem, the present research imported a concept mapping knowledge representation model as an auxiliary strategy for question-posing activities based on the research finding that visual knowledge representations are conducive to high-order thinking. It also developed a ubiquitous learning system which integrated multilevel concept mapping and question-posing strategy guidance to investigate the application effects of this learning model. A quasi-experimental design was applied, and an experiment was conducted to measure 5th graders' learning of a plant unit of the natural science curriculum. Students in the experimental group learned with the proposed ubiquitous learning system based on the multilevel concept mapping and question-posing approach, while those in the control group learned with the ubiquitous learning system based on the question-posing approach. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group from the perspectives of learning achievement and question-posing performance, but no significance was found in their cognitive load, meta-cognitive awareness, and science learning strategies. • The concept mapping-based question-posing approach promotes effective learning. • The concept mapping-based question-posing approach lowers cognitive load. • The concept mapping-based question-posing approach motivates learning. • Scaffolding question posing with concept mapping increases question-posing quality.

AB  - The study investigates the effect of an interactive simulation with embedded inquiry support, which was seamlessly embedded within the simulation, on students' scientific literacy and school science achievement, and explores the relationships among prior school science achievement, inquiry processes and scientific literacy. A total of 49 eighth-grade students at a public junior high school in northern Taiwan participated. Data collected include the students' pre- and post-scores for school science achievement, logging data that indicate their inquiry processes, and pretest, posttest, and delayed-test data that measure their scientific literacy. The results provide evidence that the designed simulation and inquiry support had a long-term effect on the students' scientific literacy. Replacing conventional teaching with inquiry activities did not harm the students' school science achievement performances. Moreover, compared to school science achievement, students' scientific literacy seems a better predictor of their inquiry behavior, especially in the aspect of making conclusions. Analyses of the students' inquiry processes indicate that the so-called low science achieving students conducted more data analyses than the other students, and demonstrated adequate inquiry engagement. The students with middle level school science achievement demonstrated the most active engagement in inquiry and showed good gains of scientific literacy after the learning. These results indicate that a guided inquiry learning environment can support students with different levels of school science achievement to highly engage in science inquiry. Implications and future studies are discussed. • The designed simulation and embedded inquiry support had a long-term effect on the students' scientific literacy. • Compared to school science achievement, students' scientific literacy seems a better predictor of their inquiry behavior. • The low science achieving students conducted more data analyses and demonstrated adequate inquiry engagement. • The middle-level achieving students demonstrated the most active engagement in inquiry and gains of scientific literacy.

AB  - The study examined the Impact of Peer-Mediated Learning on achievement and motivation in computer science among senior secondary school students in Minna metropolis, Niger state. The study adopted a randomized pre-test, post-test control group design. Two hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. Purposive sampling technique was used to select four (4) Private Secondary Schools from Minna, Metropolis. Eighty (80) Students were drawn from the four Secondary Schools as sample size through stratified random sampling technique. Validated Test Instrument; Basic Computer Skills Acquisition Test (BCSAT) and Questionnaire: Motivated Strategy for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ) vetted by experts from Computer Science and Educational Technology Departments were used for data collection. The BCSAT was made up of 20 items multiple-choice objective test questions to test students' cognitive knowledge and 5 practical questions, each comprising steps that tested students' computer practical skills while MSLQ, a Likert scale with 31 items was used to determine the motivational beliefs of students taught computer skills. ANOVA and Kruskal Wallis H test was used for data analysis and was tested at 0.05 level of significance. The study revealed that there was a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of students taught using Peer-Mediated Learning (PML) than those taught using conventional method. The study further revealed that students' motivation towards PML were significantly positive when compared to the students taught using conventional method. Based on these findings, the researchers recommended that Secondary Schools should adopt PML for effective teaching and learning of computer skills related concepts in Computer Science.

AB  - Conceptual change theories assume that knowledge structures grow during the learning process but also get reorganized. Yet, this reorganization process itself is hard to examine. By using concept maps, we examined the changes in students' knowledge structures and linked it to conceptual change theory. In a longitudinal study, thirty high-achieving students (M = 14.41 years) drew concept maps at three timepoints across a teaching unit on magnetism and electrostatics. In total, 87 concept maps were analyzed using betweenness and PageRank centrality as well as a clustering algorithm. We also compared the students' concept maps to four expert maps on the topic. Besides a growth of the knowledge network, the results indicated a reorganization, with first a fragmentation during the unit, followed by an integration of knowledge at the end of the unit. Thus, our analysis revealed that the process of conceptual change on this topic was non-linear. Moreover, the terms used in the concept maps varied in their centrality, with more abstract terms being more central and thus more important for the structure of the map. We also suggest ideas for the usage of concept maps in class. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Rotational dynamics is one of topic in physics for high school students that require visualization of its concepts. This research developed an interactive e-book for physics learning with its features consisting of multimedia content such as audio, video, animation, and simple problem-solving activities. This e-book has been validated and recommended by a team of experts. This trial aims to determine the effectiveness of e-book by students in mastering concepts, using a. quasi-experiment. The sample was chosen using purposive sampling technique at senior high school with 42 students. Data were collected using multiple choice questions. The increase of student concept mastery is determined based on the N-gain score of pretest and posttest data. The results show that the average student response to e-book is 81% in the very good criterion. The N-gain scores for the equilibrium concepts of A and B classes are 0.79 and 0.70 in the high criteria, while, the concept of rotational dynamics are 0.66 and 0.66 respectively and in the medium criterion. The increase of conceptual mastery occurs in every cognitive domain (remembering, understanding, applying, analyzing, evaluating, and creating). In conclusion, the e-book has been effective in enhancing the mastery of student concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using findings from a 4‐year research and development effort, we propose an updated model of sheltered instruction for science classrooms that leverages the opportunities provided by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to better support multilingual learners in middle and high school science. Using data from teacher implementation logs and interviews, we examine how secondary grades science teachers' participation in our professional learning framework and subsequent enactments of an initial set of project instructional practices led these teachers to articulate nuanced and strategic adaptations to the initial practices to better meet the needs of the multilingual learners in their classrooms. We found that teachers moved away from implementing sheltered instruction practices based on general principles or formal classifications, such as students' English language proficiency level, instead taking a more nuanced approach to adopting, adapting and rejecting practices based on perceived needs, assets, and personal knowledge about individual multilingual students in the specific disciplinary context of science. Based on this analysis, we conceptualize and refine what we now see as a new and exploratory set of Next Generation Sheltered Instruction practices for integrating science and language to support multilingual learners in secondary science classrooms in the age of the NGSS.

AB  - Background: Within STEM education, research on instructional practices has focused on ways to increase student engagement and thereby reap the associated benefits of increased learning, persistence, and academic success. These meaningful-learning goals have been tied most specifically to cognitive engagement, a construct that is often difficult for instructors to assess on their own. While it has been shown that certain instructional practices are tied to higher cognitive engagement in students, tools to measure instructional practices and student engagement have remained largely isolated in their development and use. Results: This research uses previously developed instruments to simultaneously assess modes of cognitive engagement in students (Student Course Cognitive Engagement Instrument [SCCEI]) and instructional practices (Postsecondary Instructional Practices Survey [PIPS]) within a course. A sample of 19 STEM courses was recruited to participate in this study, with instructors and students each self-reporting data. Results from the instructor and students in each course were scored, and ANOVA and partial correlation analysis were conducted on the sample. ANOVA indicated the significance of and classroom structure on student engagement. From the correlation analysis, a significant relationship was found between four student-reported modes of cognitive engagement and instructor-reported teaching practices. Conclusions: With an understanding of student engagement response to classroom structure, instructors may consider their teaching environment when implementing instructional practices. Moreover, Interactivity with Peers, the deepest mode of cognitive engagement suggested by previous research, was correlated with instructional practices in our study, suggesting that instructors may be able to shape their students' learning by encouraging collaboration in the classroom. We also found that assessment played a role in students' cognitive engagement; this indicates that instructors may wish to thoughtfully consider their methods of assessment to facilitate modes of cognitive engagement associated with deeper learning of course material. By understanding factor correlations, the PIPS and SCCEI can be used in tandem to understand impacts of instructional practices on student cognitive engagement within a course. We conclude that there is a need for ongoing research to study the interplay of instructional practices and student cognitive engagement as instruments are developed to measure such phenomena.

AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal – by using the concept mapping tool – the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students' concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We studied the initial conceptions of 73 pre-service primary teachers regarding the concept of ecosystem and examined how their understanding evolved as a result of participation in an inquiry-based learning exercise. The inquiry process involved identifying students' initial conceptions, making them aware of these, comparison of their ideas with scientific knowledge and knowledge building through activities in which they analysed points of agreement, discrepancies and conclusions. The activities were performed in groups and centred on the production of posters, which participants were required to compare in both the first and final sessions. This comparison, together with the qualitative analysis of the content of the posters, was carried out using a rubric designed on the basis of a literature review. The results showed that students progressed in their understanding of key aspects related to the concept of ecosystem. In particular, they became more aware of the role that humans play within such systems, although they continued to have difficulties with aspects such as identifying species in the aquatic ecosystem and discriminating between biotic and abiotic components.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to design and develop a theory-based summary writing online tool, named Summary Writing-Pal (SW-PAL), to assist English as a second language students in improving their summary writing. It also evaluates the effectiveness of SW-PAL in enhancing the students' summary writing performance and examines their perceptions about it. This mixed-method empirical study involved 53 English as a second language students majoring in computer science at a local university. Two intact groups were randomly chosen as the control and experimental groups with 26 and 27 students, respectively. The control group was taught using the conventional method, while the experimental group was taught using SW-PAL. Both groups were given a pre- and post-summary writing test. A Split-Plot Analysis of Covariance test was used to examine the effectiveness of the SW-PAL tool. A focus group interview was conducted to gather qualitative data on perceptions about the SW-PAL tool. Quantitative findings revealed that students' summary writing performance improved significantly due to the SW-PAL with a large effect size of.42. Qualitativewise, the users perceived SW-PAL to be useful as a motivating, challenging, and self-learning tool. Recommendations for practice for language instructors who wish to incorporate such a tool into their language instruction and suggestions for future research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Elementary teachers can integrate social studies into their curriculum through thematic or interdisciplinary units. This study explores fourth-grade students' responses to a month-long, structured inquiry. For two weeks, fourth-graders engaged in multiple readings of five secondary and fourteen primary sources using closed- and open-ended analysis questions and extemporaneous, text-based writing. For another two weeks, the writing process guided students through concept mapping, skeleton outlining, peer- and teacher-review, and revision. Three researchers examined students' writings for criticality, complexity, and clarity. Findings yielded positive, statistically significant correlations between secondary source usage and historical significance, secondary source usage and continuity-and-change, and primary source usage and contextualization. Positive, weak correlations appear between primary source usage and sourcing. No relationship appears between corroboration and other variables. Meaning is extrapolated for classroom practice and applied to seminal studies. Limitations include a small sample of largely homogeneous, inexperienced students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Canadian students experience many different assessments throughout their schooling (O'Connor 2011). There are many benefits to using a variety of assessment types, item formats, and science-based performance tasks in the classroom to measure the many dimensions of science education. Although using a variety of assessments is beneficial, it is unclear exactly what types, format, and tasks are used in Canadian science classrooms. Additionally, since assessments are often administered to help improve student learning, this study identified assessments that may improve student learning as measured using achievement scores on a standardized test. Secondary analyses of the students' and teachers' responses to the questionnaire items asked in the Pan-Canadian Assessment Program were performed. The results of the hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that both students and teachers identified teacher-developed classroom tests or quizzes as the most common types of assessments used. Although this ranking was similar across the country, statistically significant differences in terms of the assessments that are used in science classrooms among the provinces were also identified. The investigation of which assessment best predicted student achievement scores indicated that minds-on science performance-based tasks significantly explained 4.21% of the variance in student scores. However, mixed results were observed between the student and teacher responses towards tasks that required students to choose their own investigation and design their own experience or investigation. Additionally, teachers that indicated that they conducted more demonstrations of an experiment or investigation resulted in students with lower scores. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using problems from real life contexts which is related to learners' environment or their culture plays an important role in their learning that concept. In this regard, science educators especially physics educators search for real-life domain of theoretical concepts for effective science teaching and they consider analogical and physical models as an opportunity in their instruction. In the presented activity, we worked with 66 senior pre-service science teachers from our science teaching methods course. We used crowd movements as a real-life domain of our analogical models to scientifically explain a stampede case, then utilized physical model to explore continuity equation. Real life problem based scenarios could be used while taking advantage of the 3 D modeling in teaching of scientific principle. As a result, we found that pre-service teachers were able to make scientific explanation for causes of stampedes by using modeling activity. High school teachers and upper-level instructors could benefit from including the modeling activity introduced in this study to help their students understand the concepts related to continuity equation by designing a physical model based on an analogical model. Via the physical model, students are able to make predictions, observations, interpretations and explanations of a complex and abstract scientific phenomenon. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This conceptual paper offers a reconsideration of the application of Novakian concept mapping to higher education research by putting to work the Deleuzian concept of the rhizome. We ask: what does thinking with Deleuze's concepts offer researchers interested in concept mapping, and what conceptual, and terminological, obstacles might be created through such a reconceptualization? We have focused on the rhizomatic principles of mapping and tracing in the context of concept mapping. We contend that Deleuze offers a fresh line of flight with the potential to deterritorialise the discourse surrounding concept mapping, thus widening its applicability and increasing its accessibility to researchers who do not necessarily share the same arborescent concept mapping heritage: with its roots in science education. Exploring the overlap between rhizomatics and concept mapping also allows for the reappraisal and blurring of the boundary between structural and post-structural discourses—breaking down an unproductive binary in the literature.

AB  - Providers of K-12 in-service teacher science professional development programs (PDPs) in the United States are moving to address recent and unprecedented policymaker calls to close achievement gaps in K-12 science learning. Our systematic review of primary, peer-reviewed equity-focused PDP studies is intended to inform this movement. We structured our review around the themes of selected studies'PDP context, research design and methods, and outcomes. PDP context and research design and methods were evaluated against relevant effective practices for equity-focused K-12 in-service science teacher PDPs. The theme of PDP outcomes was structured around reported teacher and student outcomes. We use these themes to present a coherent picture of previous equity-focused PDP efforts. This picture informs discussion and selection of strategies for effective implementation of PDPsdesigned to target the needs of specific traditionally underserved student populations. It also highlights potentially promising lines of inquiry for PDP developers and researchers to pursue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The aim of this study is to determine the effects of educational games on students' academic achievement, attitudes towards the course and cooperative learning skills. Semi-experimental research design with pretest posttest control group was used. The study group consisted of 60 students at 5th grade secondary school. In this process, the topics identified were reinforced by educational games in experimental group and control group were strengthened by traditional methods for 6 weeks. Research data were collected by using Social Studies Course Attitude Scale (Cronbach Alpha=0.61), Cooperative Learning Scale (α=0.80) and Social Studies Course Academic Achievement Scale (kr-20=0.78). The mean, standard deviation, and Anova analyses were performed As a result: Social Studies Education reinforced by gamification contributes significantly more to students ' attitudes towards social studies course than traditional method. However, it was determined that it did not contribute significantly to the benefit factor. Social studies education, which is reinforced by educational games, contributes significantly more to students ' cooperative learning skills than the traditional method. Social studies education, which is reinforced by educational games, contributes significantly more to students' academic achievement towards social studies course than the traditional method.

AB  - This study aims to determine the effect of using out-of-school learning environments in science teaching on motivation for learning science. It is a quasi-experimental study and it has been designed as pre- and post-test experimental study. The study was carried out with seventh grade students enrolled in a secondary school in the city centre of a metropolis of Turkey in 2018 within a period of 20 weeks. There were 28 students in the control group and 28 students in the experiment group. Students’ motivation for science learning was evaluated using the Motivation Scale for Science Learning. The scale was used as pre-test before the study, post-test at the end of the study, and follow-up test 12 weeks after the study. In the research, the application step was carried out by the science teacher and the researcher. In the control group, science teaching process was performed in accordance with the present science curriculum. Out-of-school learning environments related to the objectives of the current science teaching were used for the experiment group during the science teaching. The students in the experiment group visited out-of-school learning environments like nature trips, botanic parks, science fairs, science museums, natural history museums, the observatory, anatomy exhibitions, and energy parks for the subjects that were taught to them. It was found in the study that using out-of-school learning environments in science teaching had a significant effect in developing students’ motivation for learning science. Based on this finding, formal education of science students can be supported with out-of-school learning environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines the effects of different simulation interface designs on students' conceptual understanding of optical imaging and mental model development, and clarifies these design implications on students' behavioral performance and average residence time. We developed simulations of two different interfaces—gesture- and mouse-based simulations—to collect and compare data from two respective student groups. We utilized a quasi-experimental design, and selected and assigned 64 sixth-grade students to the gesture-and mouse-based simulation groups. The results showed a significant difference between the mental model tests (MMT) of the two groups. Specifically, among the three aspects of a mental model, answer (phenomenon) and explanations (which explain the phenomenon) showed more significant differences with the use of gesture-based than mouse-based simulations. The multivariate analysis of variance results indicated that students using gesture-based simulations demonstrated a longer average residence time than those using mouse-based simulations. Further, the study results suggest that compared to a traditional mouse-based interface, the application of multi-touch gestures in optical imaging concept learning enabled not only the development of a more complete mental model but also the improvement of students' science explanation skills. • Mouse- and gesture-based simulations significantly enhanced conceptual learning. • Complete mental models could be created with multi-touch gesture-based simulations. • Multi-touch gesture-based simulation improved students' science explanation skills.

AB  - For learners to be successful in an information problem solving task, they should be able to effectively regulate their own behaviour. Despite views that such behaviour may come naturally to an individual, research generally shows that some learners do experience problems with information problem solving that may stem from such things as limited prior knowledge. As a means of addressing this challenge, the authors explored how the provision of both a concept map and search tool could overcome barriers to effective information problem solving. This was explored in the current study using data collected from 111 undergraduate students who completed an information problem solving activity, wherein a concept map and search tool were provided to help them write two short essays. Through the use of event-sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, two information problem solving strategy groups were identified (High Engagement and Low Engagement), which differed across time-on-task and essay grades. Additional analyses were undertaken to explore self-reported prior knowledge or motivation as predictors of group assignment. The findings show that even when presented with opportunities (i.e., concept map) to support effective information problem solving, not all learners will take advantage or glean the benefits of such tools. Trace data methodology is shown to be a promising approach to explore information problem solving behaviour that can overcome the limitations of solely relying upon self-report measures. • Engaging in information problem solving is important to learners throughout educational and workplace settings. • Identification of discernible patterns of information problem solving whilst using keyword searches and a concept map. • High engagement learners in an information problem solving task were more successful based on essay grades. • Information problem solving behaviour not associated with self-reported levels of prior knowledge.

AB  - To design, implement, and evaluate a molecular imaging elective course that would expose Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students to fundamentals of various imaging modalities and their pre-clinical and clinical applications. The "Surveys of Multi-Modality Imaging" course is a two-credit hour elective course offered to third-year PharmD and doctoral students. Experiential learning methods including active learning application-based exercises were used to supplement didactic lectures in the form of field trips (with follow-up debriefings), small group team-based tasks, hands-on demonstrations, visual modelling, gamification with problem sets, concept maps regarding given modalities, and concluding with written summary reports and formal in-class group presentations. In addition to standard course evaluations, a pre- and post-course survey were conducted to assess the students' confidence regarding course content. Since its implementation in 2013, 101 students have completed the course with 72% being PharmD students (n = 73) and the remainder being doctoral students in pharmaceutical science (n = 28). Pre- and post-assessments completed by the students the last two offerings (n = 40 of a possible 43) indicated a shift in students' self-reported confidence in discussing imaging modalities from a total of 2.4% confidence (pre-course) to 97.4% confidence (post-course). Also, post-course survey indicated that 77.5% (n = 31 of 40 participants) students strongly agreed that our immersive and experiential learning activities were beneficial to overall learning for this elective. Students who participated in this innovative experiential learning-grounded course gained an appreciation for molecular imaging and its value and role in modern drug therapy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Meaningful learning occurs by relating new information to and revising prior knowledge, making it essential to understand student knowledge before helping them move toward a more scientific understanding. In this study, we characterise prior knowledge about cellular respiration in undergraduate students enrolled in introductory biology by analysing student-constructed concept maps (N = 182) and interviews (N = 9). Students were instructed to create concept maps from a bank of 20 concepts with the purpose of interconnecting the processes of cellular respiration, showing how pools of ATP are generated and used, and identifying where the events of cellular respiration occur. Student maps were analysed for content, quality and organisation of knowledge. Interviews were used to corroborate inferences made from concept maps. Students had a simplified understanding of cellular respiration and its processes as evident by cognitive structures with limited quantities of schemas that were vaguely connected and linearly organised. Furthermore, students had a better understanding of glycolysis than fermentation. Instructors can use these findings to help students build better knowledge of cellular respiration by focusing on incorporating relevant schemas, creating quality connections among schemas, and organising their knowledge of cellular respiration to reflect biological complexity.

AB  - Two common goals of science teacher professional development (PD) are increased content knowledge (CK) and improved readiness to teach through inquiry. However, PD assessment challenges arise when the context is structured around inquiry-based, participant-driven learning, and when the content crosses scientific disciplines. This study extended the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool for examining changes in the content knowledge of 21 high school science teachers who participated in a field-based environmental science summer institute. The scoring rubric focused on documenting concepts, links, and map organization and scope in an attempt to capture development of cross-disciplinary knowledge in ways that correspond with theories of expertise development. The analysis revealed significant gains from pre-PD to post PD maps in the sophistication of links between concepts and in the number of additional, participant-generated scientifically valid concepts. Relative to the initial maps, post PD maps also manifested more complete clustering of concepts. Findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on teachers' learning and implications for future research using concept mapping as a means of assessing teacher PD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is so-called troublesome knowledge in every subject. There is various subject-specific research available on what these particular concepts are, as well as some examples of how to help students cross those thresholds. There is, however, a gap in the area of implementation, a more practical format for addressing student learning when there are threshold concepts. As active learning encourages deep learning, this is key to any pedagogical method used. There is a need for a mix of teaching approaches to address the diverse learning styles that exist in any class. This paper seeks to provide a viable format that can be applied to any subject. This format is based on a flipped lesson in physics (in a higher education context) and the results from three cohorts across two academic years. The paper highlights the need for meta-learning when dealing with threshold concepts, as well as the use of interactive videos as a practical tool that contributes to self-efficacy.

AB  - This research aims to reveal the effects of educational comics on teaching environmental issues and environmental organizations subjects in the 7th grade Social Studies course. The research was carried out according to mixed research method. The research included 83 students at 7th grade in a public secondary school in the Mediterranean region of Turkey. The experimental group consisted of 41 students and the control group consisted of 42. At the end of the study, statistical significance was found in favour of post-test scores between the mean scores of the students in the experimental group who were instructed by educational comics and those of the students in the control group in terms of academic achievement and attitude towards the environment. When the effect of the academic achievement pre-test scores was taken under control, the results of the academic achievement post-test scores of the students in the experimental and control groups were found to be significantly different from each other, which was in favour of the experimental group. Likewise, when the effect of pre-test scores on the environmental attitude was taken under control, it was found that the post-test scores of the students in the experimental and control groups differed significantly and this difference was in favour of the experimental group. And also it was concluded that students have a positive perspective on educational comics both in cognitive and affective aspects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the overall effectiveness of the flipped classroom on students' learning achievement and motivation. Data were collected from three databases, which include Web of Science, Scopus, and Eric. The present meta-analysis synthesized the findings of 95 studies with 15386 participants published from 2013 to 2019. The results revealed that the flipped classroom approach had a moderate effect size for learning achievement and learning motivation. The effect sizes of 12 moderators, including sample level, sample size, learning domain, the flip classroom model, research design, intervention duration, teaching method in the class, sample region, interactions in a pre-class and face-to-face class, tools in pre-class, and resources in pre-class were also analyzed. The results indicated that sample size, intervention durations, and sample regions significantly moderated the effect sizes. The findings of this study are discussed in-depth, together with the implications for practices on the use of the flipped classroom approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - "Complex systems" is a general‐purpose reasoning scheme, used in a wide range of disciplines to make sense of systems with many similar entities. In this paper, we examine the generality of this approach in learning chemistry. Students' reasoning in chemistry in terms of emergent complex systems is explored for two curricula: a normative and a complexity‐based one, so that the interaction could be examined under both the conditions. A quasi‐experimental pretest‐intervention‐posttest comparison group design was used to explore student's learning, complemented with interview data. The experimental group (n = 47) studied the topic of gases with a complexity‐based curriculum. A comparison group (n = 45) studied with a normative curriculum for the same duration. Students' answers to questionnaires were coded with a complexity‐based approach that included levels (distinguishing micro‐ and macro‐levels), stochastic particle behaviors, the emergence of macro‐level patterns from micro‐level behaviors, and the source of control in the system. It was found that students' reasoning about chemistry concepts in terms of complex systems falls into three distinct and coherent mental models. A sophisticated mental model included most of the above‐described complexity features, while the nonsophisticated model included none. The intermediate model is typified by distinguishing between levels, but not by stochastic and emergent behaviors. The nonsophisticated mental model was used mostly in the pretest. In the posttest, the experimental group used the intermediate and sophisticated models; while the comparison group used the nonsophisticated and intermediate models. Discussion approaches the topics of the generality of the complex systems approach; and the unique forms of reasoning that a complexity approach may contribute to learning science.

AB  - Mind maps that contain visual and verbal elements can be thought of as an effective graphical tool that can be used to reveal the existing knowledge, opinions and perceptions of individuals about a concept through mental association. In this study, the aim was to determine the mental models of middle school students related to science by using mind maps in terms of their gender and grade levels. 104 middle school students who were studying at different grade levels participated in the study. The study takes the form of a case study supported by qualitative data. First of all, students were given training on how to make mind maps, and sample implementations were carried out. Later, students were asked to prepare a mind map about the concept of science. Students' mind maps were first scored by experts by taking into consideration the evaluation criteria with regard to mind maps. In the data analysis process, each mind map was examined by using a descriptive analysis technique, while the frequency and percent values of the most common expressions were calculated. The results of the analyses revealed that the students' mind maps scores did not differ significantly in terms of their gender. It was concluded that the fifth grade students' mind map scores were significantly lower than those of other grade students. Thematic analyses showed that students mostly associate science with technology, and offer more examples of natural sciences in mind maps. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Görsel ve sözel öğeler içeren zihin haritaları, zihinsel çağrışım yoluyla bireylerin bir kavrama ilişkin var olan bilgilerini, görüşlerini ve algılarını ortaya çıkarmada kullanılabilecek etkili bir grafiksel araç olarak tanımlanabilir. Bu çalışmada ortaokul öğrencilerinin bilim kavramına ilişkin zihinsel modellerini zihin haritaları yoluyla belirlemek ve cinsiyetlerine, sınıf düzeylerine göre karşılaştırmak amaçlanmıştır. Araştırmaya farklı sınıf düzeylerinde öğrenim görmekte olan 104 ortaokul öğrencisi katılmıştır. Araştırma nitel veriler ile desteklenmiş bir durum çalışmasıdır. Çalışma verilerinin elde edilmesinde öncelikle, öğrencilere zihin haritalarının nasıl yapılacağına ilişkin eğitim verilmiş ve örnek uygulamalar gerçekleştirilmiştir. Daha sonra ise öğrencilerden bilim kavramının zihinlerinde yapmış olduğu çağrışımlara ilişkin zihin haritası hazırlamaları istenmiştir. Öğrencilerin yapmış oldukları zihin haritaları öncelikle uzmanlar tarafından zihin haritaları değerlendirme kriterleri dikkate alınarak puanlanmıştır. Daha sonra her bir zihin haritası betimsel analiz tekniği kullanılarak incelenmiş, en sık karşılaşılan ifadelerin frekans ve yüzde değerleri hesaplanmıştır. Yapılan analizler sonucunda öğrencilerin zihin haritaları puanlarının cinsiyetlerine göre anlamlı düzeyde farklılaşmadığı belirlenmiş, sınıf düzeyine bağlı olarak yapılan karşılaştırmada ise beşinci sınıf öğrencilerinin zihin haritaları puanlarının anlamlı düzeyde diğer sınıf seviyelerindeki öğrencilerden düşük olduğu sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Tematik analizler ise öğrencilerin bilim kavramını en fazla teknoloji ile ilişkilendirdiklerini ve zihin haritalarında daha çok fen bilimlerine ilişkin örnekler sunduklarını göstermiştir.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the ability of physics teacher candidates' to read a concept map previously prepared by the researchers about a light topic and then convert the concept map into the appropriate text. The study was carried out in the form of case study method in a Turkish University in the Black Sea Region with 32 physics teacher candidates in the 2016-2017 academic years. To collect data, the concept map about light was given to the physics teacher candidates and they were asked to convert this concept map into meaningful text. The meaningful texts that teacher candidates tried to transform according to the concept map were evaluated according to a reference text. The reference text was prepared by experts. When the findings obtained from the study were examined in general, it was concluded that 78.123% of these physics teacher candidates could read the concept map related to light subjects and concepts at medium level. According to the results of this study, it is recommended that studies related to reading concept maps should be studied for different subjects and concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study tested the effect of cooperative concept mapping on knowledge achievement and transfer in peace education on 159 social studies students using a quasi-experimental research design. Four intact classes—two each in rural and urban areas—were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions, and two instruments—Peace Education Achievement Test and Peace Education Transferability Test—were used for data collection. Findings showed that cooperative concept mapping unveiled students' misconceptions in peace education and their perceptions about violent behaviors, raised students' consciousness about asymmetric structures undermining peace, empowered them with ability to establish connections between intrinsic and extrinsic causes of conflict, and encouraged practical suggestions on how to resolve conflict and promote peace through enactment of peace virtues. Bivariate associations showed that students' achievement in one context correlated with their transfer of learning in another context, with stronger correlation exhibited among experimental students. We attributed the stronger correlation recorded among experimental students to the "concepts connection" and visual effect occasioned by concept maps and overt effort of experimental teachers to create cooperative, experiential, and learner-centered lessons. Also, our assumption that female students will do better than male students in peace education was met. Implications of findings for curriculum review, instructional delivery and teacher education were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problemsolving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science education today focuses on preparing future citizens who are critical consumers of scientific knowledge and not merely recipients of scientific facts. Thus, meaningful science learning is important in the learning process. The aim of this paper is to explore approaches for facilitating meaningful science learning in a context where an additional language is used as a language of instruction. The findings of this article were drawn from a video study of six teachers in classrooms in Tanzania and group interviews with 18 of their students. The findings suggest various approaches that can support dialogue by the use of an additional language. From this study it was noted that the home language of the learners can be utilised as a mediating agent to facilitate meaningful science learning using an additional language. In addition, hands-on activities, the use of gestures and real-life examples emerge as strategies supporting meaningful science learning in a multilingual context. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps can be used in undergraduate biology as ways to visually communicate the relationships among things and events. One strength of concept mapping is that there is not just a single, correct way to compose one, given a list of particular concepts. Nevertheless there seem to be associations among ideas that are expressed frequently while teaching biology. For example, hierarchical relationships among structures and steps within processes are two common kinds of relationships that students encounter regularly. Based on our own classroom experiences and surveys of concepts appearing in two popular textbooks, we provide here a resource for composing propositions within biological concept maps. This list of more than 50 linking words and phrases is appropriate for freshman biology but can be adapted for use in more advanced courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Scientific problems of the twenty-first century involve complex research questions that require an interdisciplinary approach. Educational research suggests that overall student achievement is greater in an interdisciplinary science curriculum than in a discipline-specific science curriculum. Regardless, the secondary school science curriculum in Ontario remains discipline-specific. The Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) released an 'Interdisciplinary Studies' curriculum in 2002; however, it appears to be sparsely implemented across Ontario. The objective of this study is to investigate what guidelines are provided by the OME to help Ontario secondary school science teachers (grades 11–12) design and implement interdisciplinary science courses. A document analysis methodology is used to gather data from selected OME curriculum documents. The results of this study found that interdisciplinary science courses are based on multiple models of interdisciplinarity; however, the guidelines provided for developing interdisciplinary curriculum, assessment, and teaching methods do not explicitly indicate which type of interdisciplinary model is applied, nor do the documents explicitly consider the degree of integration of concepts and skills from across disciplines/subject areas. Primarily, the results of this study may inform Ontario Ministry science curriculum writers, teachers and educators interested in interdisciplinary science curriculum elsewhere, about what aspects of the selected curriculum documents provide practical information for developing interdisciplinary science courses and components of the curriculum that may warrant potential revisions or additions during future curriculum drafting.

AB  - Résumé: Les problèmes scientifiques du XXIe siècle soulèvent des questions de recherche complexes qui nécessitent une approche interdisciplinaire. Les recherches en pédagogie indiquent que le rendement général des élèves est meilleur dans un programme de sciences interdisciplinaire que dans un programme de sciences spécifique à chaque discipline. Pourtant, le curriculum scientifique dans les écoles ontariennes reste centré sur des programmes à une seule discipline. Le ministère de l'Éducation de l'Ontario (MEO) a publié en 2002 un programme d'études intitulé « Études interdisciplinaires », mais celui-ci semble avoir été peu appliqué dans toute la province. L'objectif de cette étude est d'examiner les lignes directrices fournies par le MEO pour aider les enseignants de sciences au secondaire en Ontario (11e et 12e année) à créer et à proposer des cours de sciences interdisciplinaires. Une méthodologie d'analyse de documents est utilisée pour recueillir des données tirées d'une série de documents choisis provenant des programmes d'études du MEO. Les résultats de cette étude montrent que les cours de sciences interdisciplinaires sont basés sur plusieurs modèles d'interdisciplinarité; cependant, les directives fournies pour l'élaboration de programmes, de modèles d'évaluation et de méthodes d'enseignement interdisciplinaires n'indiquent pas explicitement le type de modèle interdisciplinaire appliqué, et les documents ne prennent pas explicitement en compte le degré d'intégration des concepts et des compétences provenant des différentes disciplines. Essentiellement, les résultats de cette étude peuvent renseigner les enseignants et les concepteurs des programmes de sciences de l'Ontario, de même que les éducateurs qui s'intéressent aux programmes interdisciplinaires en sciences appliqués ailleurs dans le monde, d'une part sur les aspects particuliers des documents analysés qui sont susceptibles de fournir des informations pratiques pour la création de cours de sciences interdisciplinaires, et d'autre part sur les éléments du curriculum qui pourraient justifier d'éventuelles révisions ou des ajouts lors de l'élaboration de futurs programmes.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) leverages technology and concept mapping to support conceptual understanding, as well as collaborative learning to foster knowledge co-construction. This article investigated the effect of different instructional designs using CSCCM on students' conceptual understanding, and on the type of processes of knowledge co-construction that students engage. Participants (N = 120) were 10th graders enrolled in their physics course, randomly distributed in dyads. They were asked to draw concept maps related to the conservation of energy law, by using CSCCM with different instructional designs (i.e., control, Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). In the control condition, dyads worked collaboratively all the time. In both Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, dyads worked first individually (one week) and then collaboratively (two weeks). However, in Exp. 2, the individual concept map was shared with the peer before collaborating. Conceptual understanding improved significantly for learners in all three experimental conditions, especially in Exp. 2. Statistically significant differences were found in students' knowledge co-construction among the three conditions. Dyads in the control group showed a significantly higher use of quick consensus-building. Dyads in Exp. 1 showed a significantly higher reliance on externalization and elicitation. Dyads in Exp. 2 showed a significantly higher enacting of integration- and conflict-oriented consensus building. Accordingly, an instructional design like Exp. 2 optimizes CSCCM learning outcomes in terms of conceptual understanding and knowledge co-construction. • Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) enhances conceptual learning. • Instructional designs of CSCCM condition students' knowledge co-construction process. • An individual concept mapping preparation phase enhances CSCCM learning outcomes. • Sharing the individual concept map with the peer fosters cognitive group awareness. • A shared individual concept map optimizes students' CSCCM learning outcomes.

AB  - Abstract Clinical experiences are an essential foundation of nursing education. While there have been many significant investigations into models of clinical education and student learning, how students 'make sense' of their experiences is less well investigated. Senior nursing staff in a tertiary health service partnered with nurse researchers to explore how students can learn more about practice through structured discussions with peers to promote shared understandings. The study aimed to evaluate the contributions to student learning from structured peer discussions about patient care. Exploratory observational study of the effects of learning circle discussions on individual understanding of patient care. A metropolitan health service in southeast Queensland, Australia. 72 Bachelor of Nursing students in Years 2 and 3. Students developed concept maps about patient care prior to peer discussions, and subsequently added further concepts (in another colour of text) after those discussions. Researchers' review of student generated concept maps and coded concepts indicated a five a priori ways of knowing categories: empirical, aesthetic, ethical, personal and socio-political. Descriptive analysis of categories was then conducted. Empirical knowing was high in both groups, with more concepts included in Year 3 student maps. Aesthetic knowing was relatively high in both groups. Socio-political knowing was lower than anticipated overall. Personal and ethical forms of knowing were rarely included on the concept maps. While clinical placement is valued for developing empirical and aesthetic forms of knowing, the other forms of knowing have value for patient and family care and warrant strategies to improve their further development. Developing strategies to support student learning of ethical and personal forms of knowing deserves further investigation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The present study defined four types of stances/positions in students' argumentation regarding socio-scientific issues (SSIs): affirmative (A), oppositional (O), multiple (M), and non-committal (N) positions. The central goal of this study was to examine the effect of students' positions toward an issue on the science conceptual understanding and quality of their arguments. Three types of debates were concerned due to their abundant production of arguments: the debates between the (1) O vs. A, (2) O vs. M, and (3) O vs. N position students. The quasi-experimental design was adopted in which three 11th grade classes totaling 108 students were invited. They were assigned to the three required types of debate according to their positions regarding two given SSIs. The results showed that there were significant differences among the three debates on both the conceptual understanding and arguments produced by the students. The OA debate exhibited the best performance no matter in the conceptual understanding and the use of claims, warrants, and rebuttals. Moreover, the OM debate exhibited the best performance in terms of the use of qualifiers, whereas the ON debate students exhibited the lowest abilities and improvements. • Four types of positions in perceiving a socio-scientific issue were identified. • The relationships among these positions were clarified and investigated. • Explorative arguments emerged in debate with relationship of multiple viewpoints. • Competitive arguments emerged in debate with relationship of opposite viewpoints. • A web-based argumentation program was developed to support such learnings.

AB  - The present study aims to explore student-teachers' (STs') progress in understanding social urban sustainability and how it is affected through the development of digital stories and engagement in civic actions. Participants were 44 STs enrolled in a Department of Primary Education located in Northern Greece. Although participants were aware of the principles of sustainable development and education for sustainability, none of them had familiarity with social or urban sustainability. Three individual digital concept maps constructed before, intermediate and after the end of the course served as data sources. Both quantitative (significance testing, effect sizes, and confidence intervals) and qualitative (categories development) methods of analysis were implemented. Results indicate a sound improvement of STs' understanding even in the intermediate concept maps with the most significant proposition gains associated with the society pillar. Moreover, despite the significant improvement in understanding of all main pillars of sustainability, this improvement was unbalanced because a minority of subcategories constituted the majority of STs' propositions in all settings, indicating a strong and constructive combination between theory and praxis for the advancement of STs' learning.

AB  - The lack of students' critical thinking skills has been a persistent problem in science education. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of Collaborative Concept Mapping (CCM) and Individual Concept Mapping (ICM) in improving students' critical thinking skills in science subjects. This study employed quasi-experimental research design that involved 189 form one students from public secondary schools in Malaysia. The manipulated variable in this study is teaching approaches, which includes Collaborative Concept Mapping (CCM), Individual Concept Mapping (ICM) and conventional method (CM). Meanwhile, the dependent variable is students' critical thinking skills in Science. Data was collected using critical thinking skills diagnostic tests and analysed using one-way ANOVA test. The study showed that the level of critical thinking skills is significantly higher among students in CCM group in comparison to students in ICM and CM groups while there is no significant difference in students' level of critical thinking skills in ICM and CM groups. This study indicated that CCM approach is effective in improving students' critical thinking skills in Science, and thus should be integrated into Science classroom learning in secondary schools.

AB  - Students always encounter difficulties in studying biochemical pathways. They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one‐by‐one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The "AG City" is a self‐learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy‐to‐understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as "railway stations". Students can easily identify common "railway stations" presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together. This interactive self‐learning tool has been packaged as a courseware using the Articulate Storyline eLearning authoring software. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(5):532–537, 2019.

AB  - In this study, researching the effect of a planned trip to one of the informal learning environments, zoos, on learning and taking students' opinions about the trip were aimed. The working group consists of 15 fifth grade students. The Experimental method was used in this research. The academic achievement test developed by the researcher was applied to the students before and after the trip to determine the effect of the planned zoo trip on the students' learning. To determine the change in students' misconceptions, concept maps were drawn before and after the trip. For the students' views about this learning experience, a semi-structured interview form was used. Pre and posttest results gotten from the achievement test were evaluated with Wilcoxon signed ranks test; the data obtained from the concept maps were analyzed with error frequencies, and the students' judgments received from a semi-structured interview about this learning experience were examined with content analysis method. Results of the research showed that a well-organized zoo trip has a positive effect on learning; that there is a meaningful difference between students' pretest and posttest academic achievement scores for the benefit of posttest; that it does not have any effect on misconceptions about general classification, however, it is effective on, more specifically, misconceptions about animal classification. Students have found this trip entertaining and informative. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Bu çalışma ile informal eğitim ortamlarından biri olan hayvanat bahçelerine yapılan planlı bir gezinin öğrenme üzerine etkisi ve öğrencilerin geziye ilişkin görüşlerinin belirlenmesi amaçlanmıştır. Bu araştırmada deneysel desen kullanılmıştır. Araştırmanın çalışma grubunu beşinci sınıfta öğrenim gören 15 öğrenci oluşturmuştur. Araştırmada, planlı yapılan hayvanat bahçesi gezisinin, öğrencilerin öğrenmelerine etkisinin belirlenebilmesi için, araştırmacı tarafından geliştirilen akademik başarı testi, gezi öncesi ve sonrası öğrencilere uygulanmıştır. Öğrencilerin kavram yanılgılarındaki değişimi tespit için gezi öncesi ve sonrasında kavram haritaları çizdirilmiştir. Öğrencilerin bu öğrenme deneyimine ilişkin görüşleri için ise, yine araştırmacı tarafından geliştirilen yarı yapılandırılmış görüşme formu kullanılmıştır. Araştırmada başarı testinden elde edilen ön ve son test sonuçları, uygulanan Wilcoxon işaretli sıralar testi ile; çizdirilen kavram haritalarından elde edilen veriler hata frekansları ile; öğrencilerin bu öğrenme deneyimine ilişkin yarı yapılandırılmış görüşme formundan elde edilen görüşleri ise içerik analizi ile değerlendirilmiştir. Araştırma sonuçları, iyi planlanmış bir hayvanat bahçesi gezisinin öğrenme üzerinde olumlu etkisi olduğunu, öğrencilerin ön test akademik başarı puanları ile son test akademik başarı puanları arasında son test lehine anlamlı bir farklılığın olduğunu; genel sınıflandırma ile ilgili kavram yanılgıları üzerinde etkisi olmadığını ancak daha özel olarak hayvanların sınıflandırılması ile ilgili kavram yanılgıları üzerinde etkili olduğunu göstermiştir. Öğrenciler, hayvanat bahçesine yapılan gezi faaliyetini eğlenceli ve bilgilendirici bulmuş, eğlenerek daha iyi öğrendiklerini ifade etmişlerdir. (Turkish) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The typical elementary classroom hosts a range of diverse students. Flexible grouping is dynamic, thus allowing for student movement and opportunities for students to work with a range of learners over time. For students with motor-orthopedic disabilities, I ensure there is adequate workspace for students to work with their peers (i.e., lower table tops, widen classroom aisles). In fact, Mastropieri et al. (2001) discovered that many students with disabilities "perform similarly to typically achieving students even though they are far behind in reading and math achievement" if they are engaged in hands-on science tasks (p. 135).

AB  - In this research, the effects of using digitally supported concept maps on the academic success of students in science classes in primary education and their opinions toward the advantages of digitally supported concept maps were examined. The research was conducted with seventh-grade students in a state school in Turkey. This research used a quasi-experimental design with two groups employing a pre-test/post-test. A total of 44 students participating in this study: Twenty-two students in the experiment group and 22 students in the control group. The control group of students experienced the concept maps using pencil and paper (manual) while the experiment used digital education materials. The data were analyzed through t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference between academic success points and then analyzed through content analysis. According to the results of the research, the students who experienced the digitally supported concept maps increased their academic success. These students reported that "learning takes place more easily" through this method. The results of this research show that the students got entertained and motivated much more in the environments that digitally supported concept maps were used. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Framework for K-12 Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) encourage us to actively engage students in learning experiences that help them integrate core ideas in a discipline, central science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts (NRC 2012). My ability to design lessons, orchestrate learning environments, and build assessments in which I felt core ideas, practices, and crosscutting concepts were seamlessly integrated significantly improved when I started thinking about crosscutting concepts in a different way. A teacher may use them as guiding tools to help structure student reasoning or as formative assessments that create opportunities to provide feedback as students develop understanding.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of flipped classroom on computer science students' engagement level among pre-university students. Computer science students were observed to be less engaged during the lecture of information system topic. Students fail to answer questions which need them to apply information system concepts into the real world situation. Hence, the flipped classroom approach is explored to solve the problem. With the increase in the usage of smart phones among students in higher learning institutions, cheaper prices of smart phones, mobile data plan and ready availability of instructional videos on the internet, the flipped classroom approach seems to be a perfect practice to be implemented. Therefore this research made use of the flipped classroom approach to gauge its efficacy on college students. Quasi experimental posttest only design was used in this research. Students were divided into two groups, namely a control group (didactic classroom) consisting of 41 students and an experimental group (flipped classroom) consisting of 43 students. These samples were chosen using purposive sampling. Students in the experimental group were required to watch a micro-lecture prior to coming to class and were involved in engaging activities in the classroom. After the intervention, both groups were measured in terms of their engagement level in class using a four-level Likert scale questionnaire which consisted of four engagement constructs namely behavioral, agentic, cognitive and emotional engagement constructs. Flipped classroom students' behavioral mean was 3.04, agentic mean was 3.06, cognitive mean was 3.16 and emotional mean 3.42. Findings showed that from the questionnaire, it was clear that the students in the experimental group (flipped classroom) were highly engaged. However, there was not much difference in terms of student engagement in the flipped classroom when compared to the didactic classroom. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Scientific argumentation skills are important for students for expressing their opinions, making decisions and solving problems in daily life. Previous studies have focused on students' scientific argumentation skills, but few studies have proposed an instructional model for specifically developing these skills by creating a supportive classroom atmosphere that considers factors that may influenced on students' ability to successfully enact argumentation practices. In this study, researchers have adapted the Argument-Driven Inquiry (ADI) model, which is a model that meets several important criteria for fostering argumentation in the classroom and we have revised the model to satisfy practical constraints faced by teachers and students in Thai classroom contexts. In this study, we describe our revised Argument-Driven Inquiry (rADI) model and provide examples of how this model was used to increase students' scientific argumentation skills when learning about socio-scientific issues. We additionally examine factors, such as gender, reasoning ability, prior experience with scientific argumentation, and content knowledge to determine what influence they may have on students' post-instruction scientific argumentation skills. Specifically, we examined the effect the rADI model had on students' abilities after controlling for covariates. We surveyed 155 Grade 10 students to assess their scientific argumentation skills using a set of situational open-ended questions. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, correlation, and ANCOVA. Findings indicated that 1) most students could develop or improve scientific argumentation skills after the instruction in most components, although the supportive argument element tended to be weaker; 2) pretest scientific argumentation skills was correlated with posttest scientific argumentation skills, but gender, content knowledge, and reasoning ability were not correlated with posttest scientific argumentation skills; 3) and after controlling for pretest scientific argumentation skills, students in the experimental group produced higher posttest scores of scientific argumentation skills than those taught by the conventional approach (p < 0.05). Outcomes from our study using the rADI model may be beneficial to teachers who seek to improve students' scientific argumentation skills in science classrooms in the Thai context. Implications for local and international use of rADI are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Physical sciences teachers in low-quintile South African schools avoid the use of inquiry on the grounds of inefficiency and ineffectiveness for test preparation. This avoidance is consistent with the view that the high cognitive load inquiry offers to extreme novices such as these learners may be prohibitive. Given the purported benefits of inquiry, this situation seems lamentable, but until empirical evidence is found to the contrary, the applicability of inquiry in this context appears an impractical ideal. In this study I begin the search for evidence of benefits of inquiry for the education of learners from such backgrounds, albeit within an educational setting atypical of the context. I investigate the effectiveness of a week-long inquiry holiday programme for 26 Grade 8 and 9 learners from low-quintile schools and the predictive value of their Natural Sciences marks for success in the programme. The findings show statistically significant learning gains from pre- to post-test scores and pre- to delayed post-test scores, as well as strong correlations between the learners' Natural Sciences marks and the post-test scores. This shows that holiday inquiry programmes can be effective at promoting learning, measured by test-performance, even for learners with backgrounds of underprivilege, at least among higher achieving learners.

AB  - The representation of knowledge is a process widely used in education for its potential to generate deep learning, metacognition, and also in mapping the student's cognitive structure while developing a broad spectrum of thinking skills. Notwithstanding the abovementioned benefits, the development and evolution of new digital ecologies of learning is still an unexplored field for knowledge representation systems. As part of a larger study, this article shows the process and results of a systematic review of literature on knowledge representation systems, with the purpose of identifying the foundations and main applicable instruments of digital educational environments. Among the most representative findings of this review is that despite the existence of a large number of educational experiences that have incorporated both physical and digital knowledge representation tools, their use has been restricted almost entirely to the understanding of concepts and the assessment of learning in non-collaborative environments. These findings suggest the relevance of studying the representation of knowledge in digital collaborative contexts that facilitate the development of thinking skills for the digital age, and the need for co-creation and transformation of knowledge. Together these suggest a new perspective on knowledge representation for digital ecologies of learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study was made in order to determine the impact of the education, based on the integrated curriculum that was developed for the theme of "Science and Technology", on the academic success of the students and the views of the students and teachers, participating in the study, on the integrated curriculum. In this study, based on associating five different lessons, it was examined whether information that is learned in different lessons can be transferred, or not. The study was performed at a middle school, at a middle-class socioeconomic level in the province of Ankara, in the academic year of 2014-2015. In this study, in which the quantitative and qualitative research methods were used together, the mixed method was adopted. In the quantitative aspect of the study, the experimental pattern, with pretest-posttest control groups, was used. In the study, the social studies, Turkish language, sciences, visual arts and elective folk culture lessons were studied with the experimental group students by being associated with each other. And in the control group, the existing lessons were studied according to teachers' routine lesson plans with a disciplinary concept. As the academic success test was used in the quantitative aspect of the study, the semi-structured interviews were made with the students and the teachers who conducted the lessons of the experimental group, in the qualitative aspect. Furthermore, the students' study documents, researcher field notes and observations were benefited from as the qualitative data collection instruments. For the analysis of the quantitative sub-problems of the study, SPSS 17.0 package program was used. In the analysis of the quantitative data, two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used; and content analysis in the analysis of the qualitative data. According to the analysis of the obtained data, it was determined that the lessons, performed with the integrated curriculum, were more effective than the existing one, in terms of academic success. As the result of the interviews that were made with the students, it was found that the students liked the lessons, studied with the integrated curriculum model, more. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking (CT) studies in e-learning settings to provide a comprehensive analysis of CT studies. Research indexed in the Web of Science database which includes major peer-reviewed social sciences citation index journals in the e-learning field from January 2006 to November 2017 was searched for a systematic review and analysis. A total of 42 studies were selected and synthesized. The distribution of publishing years, geographical areas, education sectors, publications, disciplines, research methods, activities, CT measurement instruments, teaching instruction, the CT roles applied in the studies, and the experiment durations were reviewed. The results showed that most CT studies were conducted in nontraditional teaching environments using strategies such as online discussion or concept mapping; the most used quantitative method was the California critical thinking skills test (CCTST), whereas the most frequently adopted qualitative method was the practical inquiry model of cognitive presence (PIMCP). The common method to enhance students' CT was online synchronous or asynchronous discussion, and the role that CT played in these studies was as a dependent variable for evaluating whether the designed e-learning instruction(s) can cultivate CT. This study concludes that with active learning instruction and experienced tutor facilitation, students' CT could be enhanced in a variety of e-learning environments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - One of the key agendas for the emerging field of disciplinary-based education research is the evaluation of the trajectory of disciplinary knowledge development from novice to expert. However, with the ongoing promotion of student-centered and collaborative undergraduate science classrooms, it is unknown how peer discourse during these exercises might influence (promote or hinder) student construction of expert knowledge. This study documented the knowledge structures of n = 13 undergraduate biology students in a first semester biology course for majors across four instructional units. Participants constructed both individual and group-negotiated concept maps and map complexity, propositional stream similarity, and propositional accuracy were used as measures of quality of knowledge structure. Results indicated that on individually-constructed maps, in general, students had moderate quality knowledge structures when compared to experts. Individual map complexity seemed to increase over time, but stream similarity and propositional accuracy were more dependent on content unit. Group-constructed maps were consistently more accurate than individually-constructed maps. Results are discussed in the context of the use of collaborative concept mapping as a means to develop disciplinary expertise in biology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigates the impact of the Case-Based Learning (CBL) method for the topic of 'B6, B9 and B12 Vitamins' on students' academic achievement in a biochemistry course for an associate degree level in health. To this end, a case study with the title 'The Reasons for Depression: Do We Know What They Are?' was developed and implemented. The study had a one-group pre-test and post-test research design. The 'Vitamins' Achievement Test' (VAT) and a Structured Interview Form were used as data collection tools. First-year students of Medical Laboratory Techniques at the Ahmet Erdogan Vocational School of Health Services at Bulent Ecevit University (N = 34) who were aged between18 and 20 made up the study group. The VAT and the Structured Interview Form were analysed using content analysis and the paired-samples t-test was used for the VAT. The results indicated that the frequency of students' responses in the 'clear understanding' category improved in the VAT post-test and it was concluded that there was a significant positive difference in the post-test scores of students. The results of the structured interview indicated that most of the students had positive opinions about the method, material and case study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper focuses on the design and evaluation of a theory‐based computer‐assisted summary writing learning environment called Summary Writing‐PAL (SW‐PAL). The SW‐PAL was developed based on four aspects: summarizing strategies, learning theories, prior knowledge, and cognitive load. A quasi‐experiment that involved 58 undergraduates majoring in Computer Science was conducted to examine the effectiveness of SW‐PAL in writing summaries. Two intact classes were selected with 28 and 30 students in control and experimental groups, respectively. The conventional teaching approach was employed in the control group, whereas the SW‐PAL was introduced to the experimental group. Pretest and posttest were administrated to both groups. The findings indicated that SW‐PAL improved students' summary writing performance. A significant variance was noted between intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load among students with varying levels of English proficiency in the experimental group, signifying that the SW‐PAL is more suitable for students with lower language proficiency. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Currently, there has been a lot of interest in CAL English language and numerous summary writing tools have been developed for language learning and teaching.Existing summary writing tools did not focus on learning theories incorporation.Worked examples approach is effective in well‐defined domain (mathematics, physics, etc.), how about if apply in ill‐defined domain (summary writing)? What this paper adds: Design and develop a CAL environment for summary writing.Incorporate learning theories in CAL environment.Apply worked example instructional approach in learning summary writing. Implications for practice and/or policy: Conventional teaching versus CAL environment in summary writing: CAL environment achieved better performance.Worked examples in ill‐defined domain (summary writing) are also effective in language learning.Worked examples is more effective for lower English language proficiency students.Cognitive load: Lower language proficiency students demonstrated lower cognitive load when using CAL environment.

AB  - The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. On the one hand, the investigation of such abilities is the purview of psychology; on the other hand, subject-specific educational research is also of interest, as a number of research works in the field of science education show. For computer science education, no corresponding studies are currently available. However, investigating how learners build categories from a choice of given terms may be useful for several reasons; for example, learners' perspectives on relations between terms, as well as potential misconceptions, can be detected and made available to educators aiming to improve lesson planning. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study with 490 German students from primary to higher education, in which we presented them with 23 information technology-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) on a questionnaire, with the task of assigning these to self-defined categories (and then giving their categories individual names). In the results, we identified a number of potential categorization strategies the participants might have used to categorize the given terms; these include generalization, purpose, place of use, state, part-whole relationships, and association. Recognizing and defining such categorization strategies can help teachers construct learner-adequate concept maps of the domain, which helps foster the elaboration of learners' knowledge structures in this field. We found that the younger participants used less abstract names for their categories, and observed that some participants had difficulty categorizing some terms (such as robot and 3D).

AB  - The aim of this research is to ask what kind of geography is taught in Finnish upper secondary schools and whether this knowledge is powerful knowledge. This is achieved by analysing 11 in-service geography teachers' concept maps and in-depth interviews with qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the dominance of three terms: spatiality, phenomena and a holistic approach running through the teachers' conceptions of geographical knowledge, skills and assessment. Geography is described by the teachers as a science which studies extensive spatial phenomena with the help of concepts and a holistic approach and in which values and students' own lived experiences play a major role. We conclude that the in-service Finnish upper secondary teachers' perceptions of geography are a form of powerful knowledge because they: (1) urge students to form new geographical thinking about the world, (2) give possibilities for students to study geographical phenomena and (3) evaluate their own knowledge, (4) encourage students to follow topical debates in different scales, (5) open up the students' world views and (6) support the general objectives of Finnish upper secondary schools by applying four of the six cross-curricular themes to a great extent in teaching geography, particularly sustainable development.

AB  - We examined if and when English-learning 17-month-olds would accommodate Japanese forms as labels for novel objects. In Experiment 1, infants (n = 22) who were habituated to Japanese word–object pairs looked longer at switched test pairs than familiar test pairs, suggesting that they had mapped Japanese word forms to objects. In Experiments 2 (n = 44) and 3 (n = 22), infants were presented with a spoken passage prior to habituation to assess whether experience with a different language would shift their perception of Japanese word forms. Here, infants did not demonstrate learning of Japanese word–object pairs. These findings offer insight into the flexibility of the developing perceptual system. That is, when there is no evidence to the contrary, 17-month-olds will accommodate forms that vary from their typical input but will efficiently constrain their perception when cued to the fact that they are not listening to their native language.

AB  - Real life jobs need interdisciplinary skills and educations should be adjusted in a way that students obtain these skills in their education lives. Designing interdisciplinary online courses seems to be unavoidable in educational institutions to have the technological and innovational catch-up in the 21st century. This paper includes a discussion about the importance of the assessment methods and presents BWG assessment method as an option. It is measuring students’ success in three factors with BWG Assessment: Behavioral Success, Work Success and Group Success. A teaching method, as an alternative to STEM and STEAM approaches, combining the expertise of Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts and Math with specialized, student-centered Unique projects called USTEAM was delivered to lycée students’ for 9 months. To find students’ attitude towards this new method USTEAM Attitude test is used. Descriptive Statistics, Compare Means and General Linear Models were used in IBM SPSS Statistics 25 for analyzing the data obtained from BWG pretest and BWG posttest marks of the Standard Online Courses and the USTEAM Online Courses. Results was awarding parts of the study and success was more than what was expected. Although some students were aggressive at the beginning toward being a member of USTEAM groups, they were more motivated by assuring that they didn’t have any competitors and they were expected to produce their Unique projects regardless of what others do! For motivation theorists, the results from this study provide evidence that interdisciplinary cultural influences in courses can be expressed in diverse educational settings. For educators, this study underlines the importance of cooperative and creative USTEAM activities in online courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this exploratory qualitative study was to investigate prospective elementary teachers'conceptual understanding of buoyancy. Specifically, the study aimed to identify the scientifically accepted conceptions, and misconceptions that preservice teachers hold about buoyancy using an instructional intervention. Presently, there is a gap in the research literature concerning how preservice teachers understand floating and sinking as it relates to the scientific concept of buoyancy. Conceptions were analyzed using pre/post concept maps, and interviews. Findings showed that preservice teachers had scientifically accepted conceptions and misconceptions about buoyancy as a force and that both conceptions interacted with associated concepts of buoyancy (gravity, weight, mass, density, etc.). Overall, preservice teachers showed a significant deficiency in their content knowledge of buoyancy at the end of the study. Implications include (1) the need for teacher educators to review the science content courses prospective teachers are required to take for certification; and, (2) the need for elementary teachers to understand the concept of buoyancy and all related concepts in order to develop and implement curricula related to the topic of buoyancy.

AB  - According to the Felder and Silverman Learning Styles Model (FSM), students have learning preferences regarding how information is obtained, processed, perceived and understood. The Index of Learning Styles (ILS) is an online questionnaire created by Felder and Soloman to classify students according to their learning styles. With a priori knowledge of students' learning styles, one might hypothesize that the instructor could adapt his/her class to support, and even improve, students’ learning. Still, one question that remains open is whether it is possible to individualize the FSM, i.e., if students of determined learning styles perform different (better or worse) on questions mapped to different styles. In this work, we assessed the correlation between students' performance and their learning styles in an Introductory Physics course. We designed a Learning Styles Classification Method (LSCM) and implemented it online (LSQuiz) to predict individual students’ performance on pre-class questionnaires (N = 63). We found that, in general, the ability of the ILS to predict individual student performance on pre-class questionnaires was not better than random, with no significant correlation between students' performance and their learning styles, indicated by a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of 0.54. Nevertheless, when independently analyzing the learning styles dimensions, we have identified heterogeneous data between the dimensions, with a greater correlation in the Sequential-Global dimension, with a 0.76 coefficient, followed by a coefficient of 0.50 in the Visual-Verbal and 0.35 in the Sensory-Intuitive. We found, however, that the results related to the Sequential-Global dimension are not supported by the internal consistency of that dimension in the ILS (Cronbach’s alpha of 0.30). We conclude suggesting that the adoption of customized learning practices in the Visual-Verbal dimension have potential and could be the focus of further studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Student-generated tagclouds provided an intuitive overview of a group of learners' collective knowledge. Although such tagclouds may have the potential to be used as effective learning tools, it has not been clear how students use this tool for knowledge construction. In this paper, we report a two-stage study that investigated college students' experiences of using tagclouds for developing their domain knowledge, culminating in individual concept maps and research papers. Based on the results of the qualitative analyses of students' reflections from the first stage, an intervention was introduced: group discussions on tagclouds generated from different groups. The result of Study Stage II showed that group discussions highlighted the utility of the tagclouds. Treatment group participants were more likely to use tagclouds as metacognitive strategies for planning, searching, retrieving, and organizing their learning. The two-stage study also underscored the importance of collecting students' reflections earlier in the learning process when introducing a new technology tool to promote learning.

AB  - Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have deleterious effects on health across the lifespan. Educating health professionals for ACEs awareness and prevention facilitates quality care. Literature documents concept mapping as an effective teaching strategy used in health professions to stimulate learning and foster students' critical thinking. However, ACEs curricular concept mapping remains unexplored. Method: Content analysis with manifest coding was used to identify key concepts based on faculty narratives and discussion notes about ACEs content. Results: Major and minor themes emerged to support the ACEs Curricular Concept Map development with direct and indirect paths to culture of health and health equity. Conclusions: The ACEs Curricular Concept Map was developed to guide teaching ACEs knowledge in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of ACEs curricular concepts on nursing students' learning and graduates' ability to translate knowledge to practice ACEs awareness and prevention toward health equity for all.

AB  - This study is based on the low attention of teachers on students' potential compared to academic ability. Teachers' focus on academic ability as the sole determinant of successful learning causes learning to be incapable of developing the students' potential called Multiple Intelligences (MI), whereas they can be applied to make students enjoy learning as well as develop the potential and thinking skills of students. To overcome this problem, a teaching strategy based on Multiple Intelligences was developed in science lesson. The effectiveness of the teaching strategy was evaluated by pretest-posttest-control-group design. The samples consisted of 124 of junior high school students. Data were obtained from Multiple intelligences test, Science Process Skills (SPS) test, and observation sheets. The hypotheses were tested using t-test, simple linear regression, and one-way ANOVA. The study revealed that Multiple Intelligences strategy has an effect on and can be a significant predictor of the development of students' Multiple intelligences. This study showed an improvement of the SPS, specifically in the questioning ability. The results of this study will change the teaching strategy in the future, from academic ability oriented to be multiple intelligences oriented and focus on the potential of each student.

AB  - Retention of students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematic (STEM) degrees is declining and it has been suggested that undergraduate research experiences early in students’ collegiate careers may increase this trend. We developed an animal behavior research course for freshman and sophomores, and found that students enrolled in this course had improved opinions, learning gains, and attitudes towards science. We also found numerically higher STEM retention in students enrolled in this course (98.1%) compared to college and university-level STEM retention data. Descriptive feedback from the students also indicated that they enjoyed their research experience and that the experience generated enthusiasm for research and scientific careers. These results suggest that this course may be a good working model for further undergraduate research courses at other institutions and may keep students interested in STEM careers.

AB  - There are a growing number of studies that have examined science learning for preschool children. Some research has looked into children's home experiences and some has focused on transition, practices, routines, and traditions in preschool contexts. However, little attention has been directed to the relationship between children's learning experiences at preschool and at home, and how this relationship can assist in the development of science concepts relevant to everyday life. In drawing upon Hedegaard's (Learning and child development, 2002) cultural-historical conception of motives and Vygotsky's (The collected works of L.S. Vygotsky: problems of general psychology, 1987) theory of everyday and scientific concept formation, the study reported in this paper examines one child, Jimmy (4.2 years), and his learning experiences at home and at preschool. Data gathering featured the video recording of 4 weeks of Jimmy's learning in play at home and at preschool (38.5 h), parent questionnaire and interviews, and researcher and family gathered video observations of home play with his parents (3.5 h). Findings show how a scientific motive develops through playful everyday learning moments at home and at preschool when scientific play narratives and resources are aligned. The study contributes to a more nuanced understanding of the science learning of young children and a conception of pedagogy that takes into account the reciprocity of home and school contexts for learning science.

AB  - In our first year science and sustainability education subject, how to best support pre-service teachers to meet the conceptual demands of understanding important socio-ecological challenges such as climate change is a key focus of our teaching practice. In this multi-method case study, we explore how a flipped classroom supported students' engagement and learning by way of an end-of-semester student survey, and a narrative account of our experiences, as educators, enacting the active learning strategies in class. Analysis of survey data showed that while students reported a high level of engagement with the videos and believed that they supported their learning, opinions were divided as to whether a flipped classroom was preferred over traditional lectures. Additionally, our reflections on how students engaged with the active learning strategies revealed that significant time was required at the start of class to review key concepts, as students appeared reluctant to engage independently with the planned activities-particularly those that involved more challenging science concepts. Informed by these findings, we propose a flipped learning continuum that fosters different levels of student-centred learning and autonomy, depending on students' learning needs and their readiness for a flipped learning approach. In the context of the first year experience, specifically, some teacher-led instruction may be appropriate in a flipped classroom to support students' transition to learning in higher education.

AB  - • Concepts in hypothesis testing are related through higher-order mental Processes. • Successful students appeared to have coordinated more Schemas. • Guided questions are suggested based on the results. Hypothesis testing is a prevalent method of inference used to test a claim about a population parameter based on sample data, and it is a central concept in many introductory statistics courses. At the same time, the use of hypothesis testing to interpret experimental data has raised concerns due to common misunderstandings by both scientists and students. With statistics education reform on the rise, as well as an increasing number of students enrolling in introductory statistics courses each year, there is a need for research to investigate students' understanding of hypothesis testing. In this study we used APOS Theory to investigate twelve introductory statistics students' reasoning about one-sample population hypothesis testing while working two real-world problems. Data were analyzed and compared against a preliminary genetic decomposition, which is a conjecture for how an individual might construct an understanding of a concept. This report presents examples of Actions, Processes, and Objects in the context of one-sample hypothesis testing as exhibited through students' reasoning. Our results suggest that the concepts involved in hypothesis testing are related through the construction of higher-order, coordinated Processes operating on Objects. As a result of our data analysis, we propose refinements to our genetic decomposition and offer suggestions for instruction of one-sample population hypothesis testing. We conclude with appendices containing a comprehensive revised genetic decomposition along with a set of guided questions that are designed to help students make the constructions called for by the genetic decomposition.

AB  - Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n = 245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert's referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners' productions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The merging of several teaching methods and pedagogic tools is a recurrent technique that is geared towards meeting the needs and expectations of students with varying dispositions, learning styles and intelligence styles. This study investigated the effects of blended learning on the outcomes of Ordinary Level students in a rural chemistry classroom in Zimbabwe. The study adopted a quasi-experimental research design with a non-equivalent control group. Purposive sampling technique was used to select two intact chemistry classes from two equivalent co-educational secondary schools that were distantly located from each other within rural schools in Gweru district. The main instrument used for the data collection was a Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT). The internal consistency of the instrument was obtained as 0.81 using the Test Retest method to establish the reliability. The researcher also administered survey questionnaire to students to solicit their views regarding blended learning and its implementation. Intact classes were used and in all, 67 students participated in the study (35 in the experimental group taught with the blended learning and 32 in the control group taught using the traditional method). Data collected for the study was analysed using ANCOVA. The obtained results indicated a statistically significant increase in the students' outcomes after being exposed to the blended learning approach. The findings showed positive perceptions of students on the blended learning environment. Recommendations were made that the blended learning strategy should be given more emphasis during teaching and learning of chemistry and be integrated into other related subjects in secondary schools.

AB  - A duty of in-service teachers is to prepare K-12 students in STEM education. However, due to the nature of science education in postsecondary settings, in-service teachers are ill-equipped to teach science in the K-12 classroom. The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of classroom teachers who participated in a science-focused study abroad during their time as pre-service teachers and how they use their study abroad experiences in science curriculum and instruction. Participants were two in-service science teachers who enrolled in a two-week study abroad course. This study employs an experiential learning theoretical framework, resulting in the conceptualization of a new lesson after the study abroad experience. A cross case study design was used to answer research questions. Data collection included participant- created concept maps of science experiences during study abroad, in-depth interviews detailing study abroad and classroom instruction, and participant reflective journal entries. Four themes were constructed via data analysis: (1) Experiencing science in Costa Rica, (2) Studying abroad in Costa Rica, (3) Transferability of science experiences, and (4) The multicultural classroom. Implications for study abroad decisionmakers are included. Recommendations for future research are also described. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract Concept mapping was used to identify the needs of nonkinship foster parents from Caucasian ethnicity who care for unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Nonkinship foster parents (n = 30) described their needs in response of the question: "What do you need to be a good foster parent for the unaccompanied refugee minor(s)?" Next, 50 unique responses were sorted by 15 foster mothers, and analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. Furthermore, foster mothers indicated the degree of importance of each statement. Fifty unique responses were grouped into eight clusters. In descending order of importance these clusters referred to parenting skills and a good fit of the URM into the foster family, good parenting conditions and personal skills, a tolerant society and information about options for reunification, support for the URM and certainty about the future, information on and open attitude for the background and friends of the URM, preparation of the URM and reassuring contacts with the biological family and others, support and fellow contacts for foster parents, and support from the context. Their needs resemble the needs of normal foster parents, with the exception of some specific needs, such as the preparation of URM for the placement, information about the options for reunification and certainty about the future, experienced foster care workers, specialized psychological support related to trauma, openness to and information about culture, religion and language. Highlights • Foster parents who care for unaccompanied refugee minors have specific needs. • Unaccompanied refugee minors should be well prepared for placement in foster care. • Placement success is associated with flexible cultural adaptation. • Specialized services are needed to support foster parents of unaccompanied minors.

AB  - Purpose: The research mainly aims at the hotspot of inventory management by knowledge mapping and provides a visualization reference in this research field. Design/methodology/approach: First, inventory management journals during 1986 to 2017 were selected as the research object and text formatting in the Web of Science (WOS) database is exported. Then inventory management knowledge mapping is done and clustering keywords are extracted by using CiteSpace and VOSviewer software. Based on co-word analysis, the three special clusters are exported: inventory optimization strategy, inventory pricing and inventory technology. Besides, the clustering structure and time evolution are analysed. Finally, bibliographic item co-occurrence matrix builder (BICOMB) was used to extract the "journal" and "researchers" keywords in the inventory management research fields. Setting three parameters such as the cited half-life, centrality, frequency and keywords for data mining, it can infer the trend keywords of future research. Findings: Results showed that inventory management research has been abundant in literature over the past 30 years and has experienced a change from focusing on inventory optimization strategy to inventory pricing and inventory technology in process. It shows that inventory management research focused on the classic topics and includes economic order quantity, dynamic pricing, design and technology, and the new topics include channel coordination, hierarchical price and simulation. Research limitations/implications: Based on knowledge mapping, this study is still relatively macro and cannot cover all areas of inventory management. This study only investigated the state of correlational research in WOS and Google Trends and not additional databases. Originality/value: The current research mainly builds on knowledge mapping for the research hotspot of inventory management and provides visual references for future research in this field.

AB  - This study examined effects of the Polya's problem solving Technique (POPSOT) as observed by Shaibu (1987) in Atadoga (2010) and conventional problem-solving Technique (CONPSOT) on cognitive achievement of physics students. A pre -test post - test quasi experimental design used adopted for the study. The sample comprised of 102 senior secondary two (ss11) physics students drawn from the 6(six) public owned secondary schools in Aguata Education zone, Anambra State, Nigeria. Two research questions and one hypothesis guided the study. The instruments consisted of pre-test (PREPHY) and Post-test (POSTPHY) questionnaire comprising of 20 test items constructed by the searcher. There are two groups of Physics students. One group (experimental group) was taught using Polya's problem solving Technique (POPSOT) while the other group (the control group) was taught using conventional problem-solving technique (CONPSOT). The instrument was validated, and reliability tested using pears product moment correlation technique. The internal consistency was found to be 0.87. The research questions were answered using mean and standard deviation while the hypothesis was tested using t-test statistics. The t-test used for analysis was because pre-test adopted in this study established homogeneity. The result showed that student taught with Polya's problem solving technique as in Atadoga (2010) performed better than those taught with conventional problem-solving technique. Based in the findings, the researcher recommended that physics students should be taught with Polya's problem solving technique rather than conventional problem-solving technique to enhance their learning of physics.

AB  - In computer science education at school, computational thinking has been an emerging topic over the last decade. Even though, computational thinking is interpreted and integrated in classrooms in different ways, an identification process about what computational thinking is about has been in progress among computer science school-teachers and computer science education researchers since Wing's initial paper on the characteristics of computational thinking. On the other hand, the constructionist learning theory by Papert, based on constructivism and Piaget, has a long tradition in computer science education for describing the students' learning process by hands-on activities. Our contribution, in this paper, is to present a new mapping tool which can be used to review classroom activities in terms of both computational thinking and constructionist learning. For the tool, we have reused existing definitions of computer science concepts and computational thinking concepts and combined these with our new constructionism matrix. The matrix's most notable feature is its scale of learners' autonomy. This scale represents the degree of choices learners have at each stage of development of their artefact. To develop the scale definitions, we trialed the mapping tool, coding twenty-one popular international computing activities for pupils aged 5 to 11 (K-5). From our trial, we have shown that we can use the mapping tool, with a moderate to high degree of reliability across coders, to analyse classroom activities with regard to computational thinking and constructionism, however, further validation is needed to establish its usefulness. Despite a small number of activities (n = 21) being analysed with our mapping tool, our preliminary results showed several interesting findings. Firstly, that learner autonomy was low for defining the problem and developing their own design. Secondly that the activity type (such as lesson plan rather than online activity) or artefact created (such as physical artefact rather than onscreen activity or unplugged activity), rather than the computational thinking or computer science concept being taught was related to learner autonomy. This provides some tentative evidence, which may seem obvious, that the learning context rather than the learning content is related to degree of constructionism of an activity and that computational thinking per se may not be related to constructionism. However, further work is needed on a larger number of activities to verify and validate this suggestion. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study seeks to develop and validate a model of living values-based interactive multimedia in Civic Education learning. A Research and Development approach was employed. Data were gathered through observations, interviews, document study, focus group discussions, and questionnaires. Data were analyzed by way of interactive models and a descriptive quantitative analysis. The subjects were students and teachers at junior high schools and senior high schools in Bandung, Indonesia. Results reveal that: i) the model conceptually integrates living values and the principles of living values education into interactive multimedia with especial attention to core competencies and basic competencies of Civic Education according to the 2013 curriculum of Indonesia, the principles of scientific learning, and the principles of interactive multimedia development; ii) the framework of the model consists of motivation, title, menu, CC-BC (Core Competencies and Basic Competencies) and learning objectives, concept maps, material contents with multimedia variations, motivational/reflection videos, VCT Lists, and Quizzes; iii) the results of the validation indicate that most of the components of contents, presentation, multimedia principles, and the initial product of the model are considered fairly good. Most students very positively perceived the use of interactive multimedia in Civic Education learning for character development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of foundation chemistry learners concerning the sustainable development concept.Design/methodology/approach Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted. Atlas.ti software was used to analyse the chemistry curriculum based on selected themes and sub-themes. A survey was carried out involving 132 chemistry learners. The chemistry learners were students from a foundation programme in a local university located in Selangor, Malaysia. The collected data were analysed using SPSS 21.0 involving descriptive and inferential statistics.Findings Document analysis on the chemistry curriculum shows that water is the theme most covered in the chemistry learners' textbook, as compared to other themes. In general, the chemistry learners have good knowledge and attitude concerning the sustainable development concept. However, their knowledge and attitude do not reflect in their behaviour as an individual, as well as in the classroom. Moreover, their knowledge, attitude and behaviour focus more on environmental dimension, as compared to other sustainable development dimensions.Practical implications This paper is instrumental in assisting educators to assess how chemistry learners perceive sustainable development, and this may help to bring about changes to improve chemistry teaching and learning processes towards education for sustainable development.Originality/value This paper is an original and novel research paper which is first conducted on sustainable development concept in chemistry curriculum in Malaysia.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify conditions for the effective use of visual modeling tools that can help reduce the difficulty level of solving problems during the teaching high school students programming. Visual modeling tools are a type of software that allows you to create visual abstractions that reproduce concepts and objects of the real world with their relationships, which can help in solving the problem. In this paper, we focused on preformal models based on intellect- and concept-maps. The article gives a classification and describes techniques for using various visual modeling tools to solve problem tasks. Formed skills of working with such tools will allow students to produce, represent and express independently their knowledge. In addition, these tools allow structuring the process of solving the problem, optimizing the time for solving each stage of solving a problem task. The article presents the results of comparing the learning outcomes of the control and experimental groups, which show that the proposed visual modeling tools can help in solving the programming problem tasks.

AB  - The need for all students to develop a stronger ability to express their science knowledge in writing is important. In this article, the authors take you on a journey in an elementary school classroom with tools to help foster deeper learning and stronger writing skills in science content. With many students in high school required to pass end-of-semester science exams to receive a diploma, teaching writing at an early age across various content areas is an even more critical component of today's curriculum. Presenting curriculum material through multiple means (Universal Design for Learning-Representation) allows students to gain information through a learning approach that best fits the students' learning needs. The authors examine multiple means of representing science curriculum to engage students in creating detailed and comprehensive concept maps and to provide supportive scientific evidence in written explanations as they gain more content knowledge in science.

AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students' understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The research assessed secondary school students' conceptions of acid-base strengths by using the conceptual change instruction accompanied with concept maps and analogies. These teaching strategies were employed to help them make unfamiliar events familiar. Within a quasi-experimental design, the sample of the study consisted of 73 secondary school students. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data. The results showed that the experimental group that took the conceptual change-oriented instruction performed better than the control group. In light of the results, it can be concluded that employing such visuals and interactive materials as concept maps and analogies for achieving conceptual change is effective in generating better understanding of chemistry concepts.

AB  - In this study, the use of concept cartoons in a particle structure of matter unit was investigated using the flow map of 7th-grade students' academic achievement. The development of their cognitive structures and thoughts about concept cartoons was analyzed. 27 experimental and 27 control group students who were studying in the 7th grade participated in this research. The model of the study was "pre-test posttest control group model" from the experimental research models. Achievement test and concept cartoons developed by the researcher were used as data collection tools. As a result of this research, it was found that there was a difference between the post-test average scores in favor of the experiment group. The cognitive structures of the students were analyzed by the flow map technique, and there was a significant difference between the pre-test and post-test mean scores of the control group in the obtained data, but there was no significant difference in the correctness parameter. In the experimental group, there was a significant difference in the mean scores of size, integratedness, correctness, and richness parameters. When the opinions of the students on the use of concept cartoon were examined, it was revealed that the cartoons were thoughtful, funny, deficient in information, and different from each other. When the literature was examined, no research investigated the effect of concept cartoons on the academic achievement and cognitive structures of students and tried to reveal the cognitive structures of learners in a concrete way using flow map, which makes this study important.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of teachers’ use of focus questions on students’ knowledge structures and classroom teaching-learning process by re-analyzing selected data from a quasi-experimental pre-post video study (Wadouh, <xref>2007</xref>). Focus questions are content-related anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual lessons (Forbes & Davis, <xref>2010</xref>). In Wadouh’ study, students answered a knowledge test before and after the lesson on “blood and the circulatory system” and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were re-analyzed for teachers’ use of focus questions—no focus questions, non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging focus questions. Individual students’ scores in the concept mapping exercise were aggregated as students’ topic-related knowledge structure. Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers’ use of specific and challenging focus questions on students’ topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students’ co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their pre-instructional ideas, whereas non-specific or simple focus questions anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific knowledge. This study’s limitations and implications for teacher education reform are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The use of external representations has a potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially in hypothesis generation and scientific reasoning, which are typical difficulties encountered by students. This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three‐dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group‐based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open‐ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept mapping is an important tool used in science learning to help students construct understanding about fundamental concepts and how they are related. The EcoXPT research project has the goal of supporting authentic experiment-based inquiry within an immersive virtual world curriculum for middle school ecosystem science. It builds on prior research with the EcoMUVE curriculum, which includes, as a culminating activity, student teams creating hand-drawn concept maps to represent their hypotheses about the causal relationships in a virtual ecosystem. As part of the initial Design-Based Research phase of EcoXPT, researchers developed a new electronic concept mapping tool which was piloted with the EcoMUVE curriculum. This study looks at differences in concept maps drawn by student teams based on whether they were given access to the new concept-mapping tool. The findings provide insight into the impact of concept map scaffolding choices, and inform the design of future versions of the tool. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify and understand the mental models developed by 67 high school biology students as they learn about the human body as a complex system. Using concept maps, it sought to find an external way of representing how students organize their ideas about the human body system in their minds. We conducted a qualitative analysis of four concept maps created by each student throughout the 3-year learning process, which allowed us to identify that student’s systems thinking skills and the development of those skills over time. The improvement trajectories of the students were defined according to three central characteristics of complex systems: (a) hierarchy, (b) homeostasis and (c) dynamism. A comparative analysis of all of our students’ individual trajectories together revealed four typical learning patterns, each of which reflects a different form of development for systems thinking: “from the structure to the process level”, “from macro to micro level”, “from the cellular level to the organism level,” and “development in complexity of homeostasis mechanisms”. Despite their differences, each of these models developed over time from simpler structures, which evolved as they connected with more complex system aspects, and each indicates advancement in the student’s systems thinking.

AB  - Abstract: An online course on Oscillation and Wave Physics ( https://ocw.upc.edu/webs/42254/Acustica_EN/) was implemented. As the first objective, this article describes its main features, especially the two types of indexes for accessing the different items (a traditional linear index, and a hypertextual index based on a concept map). The second objective is to describe the students’ response to the one index in comparison to the other. As a qualitative response (perception), obtained from the students’ free comments, some advantages of the hypertextual index were found, for example, the ability to raise curiosity about physics contents, or the building of a convenient attitude for learning autonomously. Some drawbacks perceived, which are put into perspective, were the possible equivocal interpretation of the guiding questions, or the uncertainty about following the optimal order of items. As a quantitative response (performance in exams), a small but significant difference was found only for two subtopics related to cross‐linked relationships between different conceptual aspects. This can be explained by a deeper internalization of these relationships through the concept map underlying the hypertextual index. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In responding to Murakami and Siegel’s “Becoming Bermuda grass,” one is led to reflect on one’s own practice in what becomes an example of reflexivity. Following the authors’ lead of incorporating Deleuze and Guattari’s rhizomatic theory and the art form of decalcomania to reflect on practice, discoveries are made regarding the practice of a middle school science teacher. These reflective discoveries can be used to inform teaching practice in a manner that supports the development of identities of participation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article argues that the development of rap song lyrics or lyrical concept mapping can be a viable pedagogical alternative to the development of concept maps as a means to reinforce STEM vocabulary. Hip-hop pedagogy is a culturally responsive pedagogy that leverages the funds of knowledge acquired from hip-hop culture. Unfortunately, many students with strong hip-hop cultural identities may lack equally strong mathematics identities. Given the success of hip-hop pedagogies within the science content area, we posit that hip-hop pedagogies are appropriate in other STEM content areas such as mathematics. Concept mapping is an instructional tool that has been empirically validated as an effective means to develop strong conceptualizations of mathematics content. While hip-hop pedagogy is well established in the science content area, it remains underdeveloped within mathematics education. We argue that the lyrical structure of a rap song is fundamentally similar to the structure of a concept map. This article provides a framework to support lyrical concept mapping as a culturally responsive instructional tool that can be used as an alternative to traditional concept mapping. Special attention is placed on the use of hip-hop pedagogy to affirm and empower dually marginalized students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review.Design/methodology/approach A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability.Findings Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach.Research limitations/implications Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students.Practical implications By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making.Social implications The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration.Originality/value This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student-student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students’ interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (R2 = .05) and supportive interactions (R2 = .16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (R2 = .07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (R2 = .07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (R2 = .28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Despite increasing attention to STEM education worldwide, there is considerable uncertainty as to what constitutes STEM education and what it means in terms of curriculum and student outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the commonalities and variations in educators’ conceptualizations of STEM education. Sensemaking theory framed our analysis of ideas that were being selected and retained in relation to professional learning experiences in three contexts: two traditional middle schools, a STEM-focused school, and state-wide STEM professional development. Concept maps and interview transcripts from 34 educators holding different roles were analyzed: STEM and non-STEM teachers, administrators, and STEM professional development providers.Results: Three themes were included on over 70% of the 34 concept maps: interdisciplinary connections; the need for new, ambitious instructional practices in enacting a STEM approach; and the engagement of students in real-world problem solving. Conceptualizations of STEM education were related to educational contexts, which included the STEM education professional development activities in which educators engaged. We also identified differences across educators in different roles (e.g., non-STEM teacher, administrator). Two important attributes of STEM education addressed in the literature appeared infrequently across all contexts and role groups: students’ use of technology and the potential of STEM-focused education to provide access and opportunities for all students’ successful participation in STEM.Conclusions: Given the variety of institutionalized practices and school contexts within which STEM education is enacted, we are not convinced that a single worldwide definition of STEM education is critical. What we do see as essential is that those working in the same system explore the common elements that are being attributed to STEM education and co-construct a vision that provides opportunities for all their students to attain STEM-related goals. This is especially important in the current reform contexts related to STEM education. We also see that common conceptions of STEM education appear across roles and contexts, and these could provide starting points for these discussions. Explicitly identifying the ideas educators are and are not selecting and retaining can inform professional learning activities at local and larger scales. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners’ knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners’ knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review.Design/methodology/approach A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability.Findings Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach.Research limitations/implications Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students.Practical implications By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making.Social implications The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration.Originality/value This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

AB  - Abstract: Learner‐centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health‐profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long‐term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case‐based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension‐based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health‐professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:343–353, 2018.

AB  - A lot of research studies have been conducted on effects of teaching methods on academic performance of students and they proved to be significant. But there is a discordant view on their results. This study uses metaanalytic review to harmonize studies conducted in Nigeria from 1990 to 2010 on effect of teaching method on students' academic performance in chemistry. This quasi experimental review was carried out under six phases namely; collection of the study, coding of the study, determination of inter-raters reliability, setting a benchmark for selecting a study, calculation of effect sizes and carrying out analysis. The required research studies must have statistics descriptions for computation of effect size. Fifty-one research works were sampled and used because they met the benchmark set for selection. Seven classes of teaching method were identified and they include: mastery learning (-0.013), Computer Assisted Instruction (0.146), Instructional Materials (0.208), Problem solving (0.315), Constructivist/concept mapping (-0.203), games/simulation/animations (0.173), student grouping/cooperative learning (0.218). The overall effect size is 0.147. The significant variations in the magnitude of effect sizes were resolved to some extent by application of random-model effect size meta-analytic technique. The major implication of this review is that we generated the most effective method of teaching chemistry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Highlights • Evaluated student understanding of tissue engineering as a result of hands-on module. • Module involved cell culture elements, histology, and DNA quantification. • Learning assessed with concept maps and design prompts prior to and after module. • Results show students broadened their perception and understanding of the field. • Experiential modules are beneficial for teaching students multi-disciplinary topics. Abstract This study focused on examining how students’ perception and understanding of the tissue engineering field changed as a result of their participation in a hands-on experiential learning module. The module involved the cellular and biochemical characterization of three-dimensional cultures of mesenchymal stem cells in chondrogenic media. Students were instructed to complete concept maps depicting their perception of the tissue engineering field both prior to and after completion of the module. Similarly, they had to respond to provided design prompts and identify experimental tests and questions for doctors that would allow determination of their adaptive expertise. The results from this study demonstrate that students significantly broaden their perception of the tissue engineering field through statistically significant changes in their comprehensiveness and correctness scores on the concept map rubric. Similarly, the results of the adaptive expertise analysis demonstrate that students significantly increased adaptive expertise upon completion of the module in comparison to their responses at the start of the module. These results imply that a hands-on experiential module can be a beneficial tool for teaching students the complexity associated with a multidisciplinary field such as tissue engineering.

AB  - A wide range of opinions exist regarding the science of social work, yielding a challenging discourse to navigate in its entirety. Yet understanding the diverse perspectives and contributions is critical for doctoral students of social work. This teaching note describes the use of concept mapping as a pedagogical method employed by a class of doctoral students and their instructor to articulate the various points of view expressed in the recent literature. We begin with a brief overview of concept mapping, followed by a description of our four-stage methodology. This teaching note offers a brief conclusion that remarks on the value of the exercise and its potential in social work education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Some research findings showed that Indonesian students' critical thinking skills below average, especially those who have a low academic ability; even though that skills are needed to face this 21st century. There should be a strategy to train students to develop their critical thinking, one of them is by implementing an appropriate learning model. One of the alternatives is Reading-Concept Map-Timed Pair Share (Remap-TmPS) model. This study aimed to find out the effect of Remap-TmPS model and students' different academic ability towards their critical thinking skills on Biology. This research was conducted in Senior High Schools in Batu, East Java, Indonesia. Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Control Group Design was employed in this study and 116 students were involved as the participants. There were two experimental classes taught using Remap-TmPs and two control classes taught as well by using conventional learning. Data on students' critical thinking skills were collected using an essay test. The results of the test were assessed using the critical thinking skills' scoring rubric and an ANACOVA test. The research finding showed that students who have the low academic ability in Biology learning who taught by using Remap-TmPS have equal critical thinking skills or the same as students' who have high academic ability who taught by using conventional learning. So, learning Biology using Remap-TmPS can be used as an alternative for students' who have a low academic ability in order to enhance their critical thinking skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (<italic>n</italic> = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (<italic>g</italic> = 0.58, <italic>p</italic> < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (<italic>g</italic> = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (<italic>g</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important skill in today’s rapidly changing times, as industries and economies depend upon innovation. It is therefore a requirement for school graduates, especially those who strive towards a technical or scientific career. However creativity has not been integrated into curricula of STEM subjects in many European countries including Germany. To successfully incorporate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers’ and student teachers’ attitudes towards creativity, as they influence teaching and lesson planning. In cooperation with Kagoshima University, Japan, the possibility to investigate Japanese student teachers’ conceptions of creativity and compare them with those of their German colleagues became available. This is of special interest as many differences exist between Germany and Japanese, such as the culture, society and educational system as well as different rankings in PISA and TIMSS. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate, compare and analyse the concepts and views of German and Japanese student teachers. To achieve this, a research instrument, including the creation of concept maps and a questionnaire have been used. In the evaluation of the data, an extensive qualitative analysis of the propositions in the concept maps and statements in the questionnaire were made. These were supported by structural and quantitative analysis. The results show that almost all the student teachers in this study had a positive attitude towards creativity, but there were differences in the understanding and implementation of creativity in the classroom.

AB  - In recent decades, internationalization within higher education has emerged as a distinct field for practice and research. However, there are few meta-analyses of how the research trends and foci of this topic have evolved and shifted over time. This article analyzes the content of the Journal of Studies in International Education (JSIE), a central outlet for internationalization research, thus shedding light on overarching developments and trends within the field. In this investigation, the text-mining tool Leximancer™ is used to generate concept maps based on the titles and abstracts of all 406 scientific articles published in the JSIE between 1997 and 2016 (first issue). Four major developmental waves in this research area are revealed: delineation of the field (1997-2001), institutionalization and management of internationalization (2002-2006), consequences of internationalization: student needs and support structures (2007-2011), and currently, moving from the institutional to the transnational context of internationalization (2012-2016). The results show how the meaning of the concept has evolved to encapsulate several other related concepts in research on higher education, while reporting practices toward internationalization at individual, institutional, and national levels.

AB  - The aim of this research was to reveal the relationship between student's reading interest and critical thinking skills through Reading Concept Map Group Investigation (Remap GI) and Reading Concept Map Jigsaw (Remap Jigsaw) learning models. To do so, two science classes from first grade of two Senior High Schools in Malang, Indonesia were selected as the participants of the study. They were given the reading interest questionnaire and critical thinking skills essay test after thought by two different learning models. The obtained data were analyzed through Pearson Product Moment Coefficient of Correlation and doing a statistical regression analysis. The result revealed that there was no correlation between two variables both in Remap GI or Remap Jigsaw class. Because of no correlation between two variables was found, two variables were compared through Remap GI and Remap Jigsaw using descriptive analysis. The finding of this study has some implications for teachers to consider some aspect or skills from students and their relationship with each other. So the teacher can predict what needs to be developed and how to do it. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explored early stages of civic engagement among 48 young adolescents by examining what they think about as a result of participating in various civic learning activities during a summer civics camp, and whether or not this thinking varied based on participants' entering civic profiles. Participant thinking was assessed through concept maps. Based on survey data, participants were classified into entering profiles of civic development: justice-oriented or participatory youth; civically purposeful or not, and civically involved or not. Findings show that, of the eight camp activities studied, interactions with guest speakers from various community agencies were most likely to generate thinking about knowledge and civic action. Participant thinking did not differentiate in any consistent ways based on whether or not they were justice-oriented. However, there were differences in thinking when participants were classified by presence or absence of civic purpose and civic involvement. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although concept mapping remains widely used in education, there is little research showing how best to teach it. We investigated if practice, feedback, and knowledge of relational framing help improve students' concept mapping skills over time. Four online graduate courses at two universities were randomly assigned to one of two teaching conditions: a traditional concept map teaching strategy or traditional plus relational framing teaching strategy. Students in each course created three concept maps over three weeks following repeated instruction and instructor feedback. Repeated practice and feedback improved the structural quality of students' concept maps, as well as the number of autobiographical elaborations within those maps. Teaching strategy moderated the effect of practice and feedback on the relational quality of students' maps. Relational scores in relational framing groups improved over time, whereas those in the traditional groups remained unchanged. Implications for teaching concept mapping are discussed.

AB  - This study presents an 'education for sustainability' curricular model which promotes science learning in an elementary classroom through equity pedagogy. A total of 25 fourth-grade students from an urban, public school in Denver, Colorado participated in this mixed-methods study where concept maps were used as a tool for describing and assessing students' understanding of ecosystem interactions. Concept maps provide a more holistic, systems-based assessment of science learning in a sustainability curriculum. The concept maps were scored and analyzed using SPSS to investigate potential differences in learning gains of English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Gifted/Talented (GT) students. Interviews were conducted after the concept maps were administered, then transcribed and inductively coded to generate themes related to science learning. Interviews also encouraged students to explain their drawings and provided a more accurate interpretation of the concept maps. Findings revealed the difference between pre- and post-concept map scores for ELA and GT learners were not statistically significant. Students also demonstrated an increased knowledge of ecosystem interactions during interviews. Concept maps, as part of an education for sustainability curriculum, can promote equity by providing diverse learners with different--yet equally valid--outlets to express their scientific knowledge.

AB  - Introduction: Sport management is a relatively young and fast-growing academic discipline. Through the dedication of scholars, the field has matured into a distinctive discipline in recent years. Meanwhile, many Asian scholars collaborated to organize the Asian Association for Sport management (AASM), an association created with the purpose of bringing together academics in the field of sport management to not only promote but also carry out practical research. In order to gain a better understanding of the evolution of sport management research in Asia, the purpose of this study was to map out the sport management research landscape in Taiwan and Korea. Methods: Leximancer (a text-mining tool for visualizing the structure of concepts and themes in the text) was used by analyzing data from articles published in the Journal of Taiwan Society for Sport Management (from 2002 to 2017) and the Korean Journal of Sport Management (from 1996 to 2017). These two journals were selected due to their relatively long histories of publication and their large volumes of articles, which allow for more thorough and accurate analyses of trends and themes in these two nations. Results: Between the two journals, the themes "Sport" and "Satisfaction" were shared. However, Taiwanese studies in sport management placed more emphasis on the themes "Leisure" and "Education," while studies in Korea concentrated on "Professional" subjects. Taiwan studies also moved from a physical education focus toward participant experience in leisure activities, sporting events, and sports strategies over time. On the other hand, earlier studies in Korea focused more on the development of the sports industry and strategies to promote public sports, while recent articles emphasize sport participants' and spectators' behavior by empirically examining the relationship between variables such as satisfaction, service quality, value, brand image, attitude, and behavior. Conclusion: This study firstly examined and compared the sport management literature between Asian countries. The findings provide a better understanding of different patterns and trends of sport management research in Taiwan and Korea. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives Collaborations between communities, healthcare practices and academic institutions are a strategy to address health disparities. Trust is critical in the development and maintaining of effective collaborations. The aim of this pilot study was to engage stakeholders in defining determinants of trust in community academic research partnerships and to develop a framework for measuring trust. Methods The study was conducted by five collaborating National Institute of Health’ Clinical and Translational Sciences Awardees. We used concept mapping to engage three stakeholders: community members, healthcare providers and academicians. We conducted hierarchical cluster analysis to assess the determinants of trust in community-academic research partnerships. Results A total of 186 participants provided input generating 2,172 items that were consolidated into 125 unique items. A five cluster solution was defined: authentic, effective and transparent communication; mutually respectful and reciprocal relationships; sustainability; committed partnerships; and, communication, credibility and methodology to anticipate and resolve problems. Conclusion Results from this study contribute to an increasing empirical body of work to better understand and improve the underlying factors that contribute to building and sustaining trust in community academic research partnerships.

AB  - E-Learning has become a common way to teach and learn. The number of technologies for a variety of educational purposes is already quite high and constantly rising. Scientific experiments and studies increasingly confirm the usefulness of various technologies for teaching purposes. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of formal training and support of digital skills within faculty training. Studies that report the potential of E-Learning are matched by those reporting the barriers. Universities throughout Europe have now established Learning Management Systems (LMS); instead of using these to their full potential, lecturers often just upload their syllabus and some reading material. At the same time, higher education institutions all over Europe are expected to implement innovative technologies and scenarios such as Open Educational Resources (OER) or Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but only a small number of universities actually do so. What are the reasons for not utilizing the pedagogic potentials of E-Learning? What findings does the current research provide on this topic? Which barriers can be derived from studies and what can be done to avoid them? What are the individual barriers of one institution or university? This contribution summarizes barriers that were identified in recent studies and discusses possible solutions to finding connections between barriers to mitigate the negative effects. It also describes a data collection method (group concept mapping) suitable for identifying the individual barriers at an institution or university using a study in the European ERASMUS+ project AduLeT (Advanced Use of Technologies in Higher Education) as an example.

AB  - Given that parents are the main carriers of change in their child, their participation in programs for preventing behavior problems in early childhood represents a key element in ensuring the success of the intervention. That said, although at-risk families benefit the most from this type of program, they are identified as being hard to reach. This study aims at identifying the factors that influence parent recruitment based on the points of view of the actors concerned. To this end, a concept mapping operation was performed, which involved parents ( n = 19), practitioners (n = 19), and administrators ( n = 13) from community and public organizations. The participants generated 131 statements to complete the following sentence: In your opinion , parents would enroll more in prevention activities for their child if…. These 131 statements were classified into 12 groups representing the factors that influence parent recruitment, all of which were considered relatively important (between 3.51 and 4.42 on 5). The participants also agree on an understanding of recruitment that tends toward an ecological model. This study shows that parent recruitment into prevention programs targeting behavior problems in early childhood is complex and multifactorial (including factors that concern parents, practitioners, services, organizations, and policies). Because the map shows that the influencing factors in recruitment appear to be interrelated, they should all be considered to increase the chances of reaching at-risk families.

AB  - Two forms of interactive video were assessed in an online course focused on conservation. The hypothesis was that interactive video enhances student perceptions about learning and improves mental models of social-ecological systems. Results showed that students reported greater learning and attitudes toward the subject following interactive video. Moreover, metrics of network complexity applied to students' concept maps of socio-ecological systems increased longitudinally through the course highlighting greater awareness of socio-ecological linkages. We conclude that interactive video can increase awareness of interdisciplinary connections in socio-ecological systems and should be more widely employed in general education geography courses.

AB  - Teachers need an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to enable them to incorporate NOS into their teaching of science. The current study examines the usefulness of a strategy for challenging or changing teachers' understandings of NOS. The teachers who participated in this study were 10 initial teacher education chemistry students and six experienced teachers from secondary and primary schools who were introduced to an explicit and reflective activity, a dramatic reading about a historical scientific development. Concept maps were used before and after the activity to assess teachers' knowledge of NOS. The participants also took part in a focus group interview to establish whether they perceived the activity as useful in developing their own understanding of NOS. Initial analysis led us to ask another group, comprising seven initial teacher education chemistry students, to take part in a modified study. These participants not only completed the same tasks as the previous participants but also completed a written reflection commenting on whether the activity and focus group discussion enhanced their understanding of NOS. Both Lederman et al.'s (Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 39(6), 497-521, 2002) concepts of NOS and notions of 'naive' and 'informed' understandings of NOS and Hay's (Studies in Higher Education, 32(1), 39-57, 2007) notions of 'surface' and 'deep' learning were used as frameworks to examine the participants' specific understandings of NOS and the depth of their learning. The ways in which participants' understandings of NOS were broadened or changed by taking part in the dramatic reading are presented. The impact of the data-gathering tools on the participants' professional learning is also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous studies have shown that students often ignore molecular mechanisms when describing genetic phenomena. Specifically, students tend to directly link genes to their encoded traits, ignoring the role of proteins as mediators in this process. We tested the ability of 10th grade students to connect genes to traits through proteins, using concept maps and reasoning questions. The context of this study was a computational learning environment developed specifically to foster this ability. This environment presents proteins as the mechanism-mediating genetic phenomena. We found that students' ability to connect genes, proteins, and traits, or to reason using this connection, was initially poor. However, significant improvement was obtained when using the learning environment. Our results suggest that visual representations of proteins' functions in the context of a specific trait contributed to this improvement. One significant aspect of these results is the indication that 10th graders are capable of accurately describing genetic phenomena and their underlying mechanisms, a task that has been shown to raise difficulties, even in higher grades of high school.

AB  - This research aims to study impacts of the teaching method - supported in out-of-school environments - of the unit of "Let's Solve Puzzle of Our Body" on students' attitude towards science. The mentioned unit takes part in teaching curriculum of Fifth Grade Science Lesson of Secondary Schools. When the literature is studied, there is no research about this unit regarding to the impacts of science lessons supported with outof- school environments on students' attitude. Therefore, this research is thought to contribute into the literature in this respect. In the research, the pre-test - post-test equalized control group model, which is one of quasi-experimental methods, has been used. The experimental group of the study includes 15 students, whereas there are 16 students in control group. The groups were determined through random sample. Before and after the research, the "Primary School Fifth Grade Science and Technology Attitude Scale" developed by Yaşar and Anagün (2008) has been used on both experimental and control groups. The students in the experimental group studied the unit with current program as well as activities in out-of-school environments. In control group, the students just studied the lessons at the current program, without having additional activities. A t-test was performed for pre-test independent samples, whereas the post-test was carried out through covariance analysis. At the end of the research, there was not a significant difference between pre-test (t29= .646, p<.05) and post-test (F(1-28)= .05 p<.05) scores. It is thought that the reasons such as the pre-test scores being high and the application being limited to just a unit had impact on failing to find a significant difference on the attitude scores. It is also thought that carrying out research on different grades from now on and out-of-school environment activities including more units might impact on students' attitude toward science.

AB  - Although studies repeatedly show both the importance of teachers’ science subject matter knowledge (SMK) and the fact that teachers have limited SMK, there are few opportunities for teachers to formally enhance their understanding of science after entering the classroom. Therefore, there is significant need for teachers to develop their SMK through classroom experience. In this longitudinal study, we explore the development of new secondary science teachers’ SMK by analyzing concept maps constructed in their 1st year of teaching and in their 5th year of teaching. We present a scoring system that reliably accounts for both the quality of connections and knowledge structure. Based on the findings presented, we conclude that these new chemistry teachers’ SMK did not change significantly from their 1st year of teaching to their 5th year of teaching. Implications for teacher educators and future research are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aims at mapping the frugal innovation phenomenon. The study reveals that scholars affiliated with Indian institutes and originated from India have played a key role in this research discipline. Country wise, the highest number of frugal innovation cases is from India. The articles on frugal innovation have published in a wide range of disciplines and journals. Scholars, practitioners, and policy-makers have understood frugal innovation concept in various ways. Studies are predominantly in sectors, such as healthcare, electric and electronics, transport, finance, ICT, and energy. On the contrary, despite high importance, agriculture and education sectors have received limited attention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Scaffolds in games have the potential to facilitate learning effects in addition to assisting the gaming process. However, studies on game-based science learning usually only adopt questionnaires to evaluate scientific concepts, and use interviews or observations to assess problem solving ability, neglecting the importance of investigating game-making outcomes. We customized a digital game, “Crayon Physics Deluxe,” with varied scaffolding designs to evaluate their effects on science learning. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, marking critical features scaffolding, and the no-game group. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and design creativity (in the form of game episode designs). Students were asked to transform their roles from problem solvers to problem designers, which might not only demonstrate their ability to solve scientific problems, but also develop their creativity potential in designing scientific puzzles. The results indicated that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and the sensitivity dimension of design creativity, while the group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of design creativity. These findings suggest that proper scaffolds could be designed to function as learning scaffolds rather than just as gaming scaffolds, and different learning purposes require various scaffolding designs. The content of the scaffolds, as well as the timing of their provision should be carefully designed according to the game features to achieve specific instructional purposes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background Researchers have established the benefits of school gardens on students’ academic achievement, dietary outcomes, physical activity, and psychosocial skills, yet limited research has been conducted about how school gardens become institutionalized and sustained. Objective Our aim was to develop a tool that captures how gardens are effectively established, integrated, and sustained in schools. Design We conducted a sequential, exploratory, mixed-methods study. Participants were identified with the help of Grow To Learn, the organization coordinating the New York City school garden initiative, and recruited via e-mail. Participants/setting A stratified, purposeful sample of 21 New York City elementary and middle schools participated in this study throughout the 2013/2014 school year. The sample was stratified in their garden budgets and purposeful in that each of the schools’ gardens were determined to be well integrated and sustained. Main outcome measures The processes and strategies used by school gardeners to establish well-integrated school gardens were assessed via data collected from surveys, interviews, observations, and concept mapping. Statistical analyses performed Descriptive statistics as well as multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to examine the survey and concept mapping data. Qualitative data analysis consisted of thematic coding, pattern matching, explanation building and cross-case synthesis. Results Nineteen components within four domains of school garden integration were found through the mixed-methods concept mapping analysis. When the analyses of other data were combined, relationships between domains and components emerged. These data resulted in the development of the GREEN (Garden Resources, Education, and Environment Nexus) Tool. Conclusions When schools with integrated and sustained gardens were studied, patterns emerged about how gardeners achieve institutionalization through different combinations of critical components. These patterns are best described by the GREEN Tool, the first framework to identify how to operationalize school gardening components and describe an evidence-based strategy of successful school garden integration.

The TLAT model involved blending lecture, in-class group activities, and out-of-class assignments on selected content areas and was implemented initially in a first-year integrated pharmacy course. Course contents were either delivered by traditional lectures or by the TLAT. A survey instrument was distributed by SurveyMonkey to determine students' perceptions of the TLAT model. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Students' performance in a total of 225 examination and quiz questions was analyzed to evaluate whether the TLAT model improved students' learning. Students' (n = 98) performance scores for TLAT-based and lecture-based questions were 83.3 ± 10.2 and 79.5 ± 14.0, respectively (P < 0.05). Ninety-three percent of students believed that in-class group activities enhanced conceptual understanding of course materials, helped them take responsibility of their own learning, and enhanced their overall learning experiences. More than 80% of respondents felt that solving cases and developing concept maps helped them sharpen creative and critical thinking skills. In addition, 90% of the respondents indicated that the homework throughout the semester helped them stay up to date and focused with the progress of the course. The use of the TLAT model led to an improvement in student learning of complex concepts. Moreover, the results suggest that this model improves students' self-reliance and attitudes toward learning. Our findings should serve as an impetus for inclusion of diverse active learning strategies in pharmacy education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate science teaching and assessing what is learned via using concept maps. Concept mapping is a technique for visually representing the structure of information. Concept mapping allows students to understand the relationships between concepts of science by creating a visual map of the connections. Concept map have been used in science to promote meaningful learning and effective teaching. It can be used by students as a study tool or by teachers to evaluate students understanding of science and to enhance science teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although concept-based curricula are frequently discussed in the nursing education literature, little information exists to guide the development of a concept-based pharmacology course. Traditionally, nursing pharmacology courses are taught with an emphasis on drug class where a prototype drug serves as an exemplar. When transitioning pharmacology to a concept-based course, special considerations are in order. How can educators successfully integrate essential pharmacological content into a curriculum structured around nursing concepts? This article presents one approach to the design and implementation of a concept-based undergraduate pharmacology course. Planning methods, supportive teaching strategies, and course evaluation procedures are discussed [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study focuses on how teachers learn to teach a new topic and the role played by their developing content knowledge as they teach. The paper is based on seven high school science teachers' studies on the teaching of semiconductors, at the time a new topic in the curriculum. Analysis of artefacts such as teacher concept maps, video recordings of lessons, journals and other classroom-based evidence shows how the extent and type of teachers' content knowledge informed their choice of teaching approaches and how their learning of content took place alongside the development of teaching strategies. The development of content knowledge was combined with increased understanding of how to teach the topic in almost all cases. Evidence of development of teachers' PCK was found in their increased ability to design teaching strategies, and their use of representations and suitable assessment tasks for their lessons. Some specific common teaching strategies were identified across the teachers. These strategies could add to the canon of teachers' topic - specific professional knowledge for semiconductors. The study provides increased understanding of how teachers simultaneously master content and its teaching and how mediated self-reflection is a fruitful approach for assisting teachers to learn to teach a new topic.

AB  - Context: concept Maps (CMs) enable the creation of a schematic representation of a domain knowledge. For this reason, CMs have been applied in different research areas, including Computer Science. Objective: the objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study conducted to collect and evaluate existing research on CMs initiatives in Computer Science. Method: the mapping study was performed by searching five electronic databases. We also performed backward snowballing and manual search to find publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies. Results: from the mapping study, we identified 108 studies addressing CMs initiatives in different subareas of Computer Science that were reviewed to extract relevant information to answer a set of research questions. The mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in recent years and it has been extensively investigated due to support in teaching and learning. Conclusions: based on our results we conclude that the use of CMs as an educational tool has been widely accepted in Computer Science. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Online discussions have become inherent components of both face-to-face and distance education college courses, yet they often fail to provide much benefit to students' learning outcomes. One reason behind this phenomenon is the lack of or inadequate scaffolding or guidance provided to students when participating on asynchronous discussion boards. Although some existing tools and strategies may encourage meaningful academic discussions by eliciting conflict among students, scientific concepts do not always lend themselves to such discourse. Instead, collaborative activities in the area of science need to incorporate the co-critiquing of a flawed external source, with appropriate scaffolding to also benefit students with low self-regulation levels by mediating cognitive and metacognitive processes. The authors designed and tested such a tool, termed Collaborative Misconception Mapping (CMM), which combines the positive effects of concept mapping and the Questioning the Author comprehension strategy. Compared with a discussion-questions based online activity, the use of the online CMM strategy lead to more meaningful discussions, as well as increased knowledge of basic statistical concepts.

AB  - Nowadays all countries aim to reach efficient education system. In the current scenario, problems of education system can only be controlled by qualified people. So, for the fruitful learning, teaching approaches, procedures, practices and tools should transfer knowledge in a way that can be inspected from different dimensions enlightening a lot of points of view, situations, and depiction of idea creation. In this way, it can be stated that one of the most important teaching and learning tool that promote meaningful learning is concept maps. The Concept mapping as a tool has gained a lot of recognition and acknowledgement in science education, both in the practice and in the literature as well. But how concept mapping is seen in the teaching profession is the aim of this research and how much beneficial and effective concept maps are in teaching learning process. Interviews were conducted from teachers. Results of the study involving 10 teachers of international Islamic university revealed that nowadays concept map is an efficient teaching tool in the classrooms used by teacher and its effectiveness can be measured through prevailing learning environment, increased student participation and understanding level of students. It also shows the advantages and some perceived difficulties associated with concept maps. The research was descriptive and focused on the understanding and specifics of experiences. Results of study led to the conclusion that at higher level the university teachers need to be aware of new and interesting teaching tools as concept map which can leave positive effects on students learning and may be used frequently in the classrooms for providing better understanding.

AB  - Phenomenon: The integration of public health (PH) competency training into medical education, and further integration of PH and primary care, has been urged by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. However, PH competencies are numerous, and no consensus exists over which competencies are most important for adoption by current trainees. Our objective was to conduct a group concept mapping exercise with stakeholders identifying the most important and feasible PH skills to incorporate in medical and residency curricula.Approach: We utilized a group concept mapping technique via the Concept System Global Max (http://www.conceptsystems.com), where family medicine educators and PH professionals completed the phrase, “A key Public Health competency for physicians-in-training to learn is …” with 1–10 statements. The statement list was edited for duplication and other issues; stakeholders then sorted the statements and rated them for importance and feasibility of integration. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to create a two-dimensional point map of domains of PH training, allowing visual comparison of groupings of related ideas and relative importance of these ideas.Findings: There were 116 nonduplicative statements (225 total) suggested by 120 participants. Three metacategories of competencies emerged: Clinic, Community & Culture, Health System Understanding, and Population Health Science & Data.Insights: We identified and organized a set of topics that serve as a foundation for the integration of family medicine and PH education. Incorporating these topics into medical education is viewed as important and feasible by family medicine educators and PH professions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - This study aimed to discover subject-specific science teachers' views of alternative assessment. The questionnaire by Okur (2008) was adapted and deployed for data collection. The sample consisted of 80 subject-specific science teachers drawn from the cities of Trabzon, Rize and Erzurum in Turkey. In analyzing data, descriptive analysis was employed for identifying how often the subject-specific science teachers use the alternative assessment and which of the alternative assessment techniques are frequently preferred. Also, how gender variable affects their preference and/or self-competency was analyzed via independent samples t-test. In light of the results, it can be deduced that the subject-specific science teachers tended to use such traditional assessment techniques as multiple choice test, concept map, written test, and matching test. Further, the main barrier to involve the alternative assessment in science classes seems to be the high-staking nation-wide exams in Turkey that deploy only multiple-choice questions. Therefore, any change in assessment strategy of the high-staking nation-wide exams may foster teachers to enrich their preferences of alternative assessment and empower its possible use in science classes.

AB  - We systematically searched five databases to assess the potential of concept mapping-based technologies to promote self-regulated learning in science education. Our search uncovered 17 relevant studies that investigated seven different types of learning technologies. We performed a narrative analysis assessing how each technology affects self-regulated learning through cognitive, metacognitive, and motivation strategies, according to Schraw et al. (2006)'s model. We suggest concept mapping technologies may affect self-regulated learning through enhancing these strategies to varying degrees. Computer software was particularly useful for developing cognitive strategies through ease of use. Teaching agents were particularly useful for developing metacognitive strategies by coupling visualisation of knowledge patterns with performance monitoring, aided by a teaching metaphor. Finally, mobile devices and teaching agents were most effective in enhancing motivation. Effects on knowledge gains remain unclear due to small sample sizes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This formative evaluation develops a novel conceptual model for a discipline approach fostering intrinsic motivation and positive relationships in schools. We used concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on kind discipline from teachers, administrators, and other school staff. Three core themes describing kind discipline emerged from 11 identified clusters: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. We mapped the identified components of kind discipline onto a social ecological model and found that kind discipline encompasses all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed. Products of the analysis and synthesis reported here are operationalized materials for teachers grounded in a “be kind” culture code for classrooms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The need for assessing higher level thinking skills and using appropriate evaluation methods in programs for the gifted is necessary to better evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. The purpose of this study was to test the claim of Novak and Gowin (1984) that concept maps required higher level thinking skills. A related purpose of the study was to assess which type of measure, a multiple choice test or concept maps, could yield a more accurate or detailed picture of the gains in content understanding of students performing at the highest level on the instruments. A mixed method research design was used to answer the research questions. We concluded that concept maps and multiple choice tests did not measure or require the same thinking skills because of non-significant correlations between the two instruments. Three judges' qualitative analysis also indicated that the number of items requiring higher level thinking skills on multiple choice tests was limited. Concept mapping as a whole process and the crosslinks component of concept mapping required analysis or higher level thinking skills. Also we concluded that concept mapping as a whole process has the potential to show greater gains in scores of the students than the multiple choice items, and crosslinks component of concept mapping that required analysis or higher level thinking skills. To have an alignment between the curricula of programs for gifted students and assessment methods used in these programs, the search for assessment methods requiring higher thinking skills is necessary and needs more investigation.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of case teaching on how students learn about genetic engineering, in terms of meaningful learning and retention of learning. The study was designed as quasi-experimental research including 63 8th graders (28 boys and 35 girls). To collect data, genetic engineering achievement tests were developed by the researchers and concept maps (CMs) were used. In the study, the experimental group (n = 31) experienced case teaching, while the comparison group (n = 32) experienced ordinary teaching. To analyse the data from achievement test scores, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann–Whitney U test were used. In analysis of the CMs, the number of concepts, number of connecting phrases, number of examples used in the maps and shape of the maps were determined. The analyses showed that the mean achievement scores of the groups significantly differed in favour of the experimental group. Also, retention of the learning in the experimental group was observed. The number of concepts used in CMs did not significantly differ, while the number of connecting phrases in both groups differed significantly in favour of the experimental group. In addition, the students in the experimental group changed their initial hierarchical maps into branched maps, indicating more connection to other concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The aim of this article is to propose a method for development of concept map in web-based environment for identifying concepts a student is deficient in after learning using traditional methods. Direct Hashing and Pruning algorithm was used to construct concept map. Redundancies within the concept map were removed to generate a learning sequence. Prototype learning system was developed based on this learning sequence using Android Emulator. For analysis purpose, 42 learners were given to learn the course Java Programming taught at graduation level. A posttest was conducted after learning for evaluation purpose. Multiple regression analysis method was applied on these results to develop regression equations for the proposed method of learning. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software was used for statistical analysis purposes. It was found that posttest results are directly proportional to the quality of traditional learning. Better quality students require less time in constructing prototype system. Further concept mapping was found to have a positive impact on proposed method of learning. When the number of concepts is large, a learning sequence among these can be generated using the proposed method. This learning sequence can be used to identify the concept a student needs additional learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The authors find justification for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the complex problems that today's students will face as tomorrow's STEM professionals. Teachers with individual subject-area specialties in the STEM content areas have limited experience in integrating STEM. In this study, the authors investigated the conceptual changes of secondary school teachers teaching domain-specific STEM courses after a week-long professional development experience integrating earthquake engineering and domain-specific concepts. They documented and then triangulated outcomes of the experience using participating teachers' concept maps and teacher-generated written materials, respectively. Statistical comparisons of participants' concept maps revealed significant increases in their overall understanding of earthquake engineering and more accurate linkages with and among science domain-specific concepts. Content analyses of teachers' learning products confirmed the concept map analysis and also provided evidence of transfer of workshop learning experiences into teacher-designed curriculum products accurately linking earthquake engineering and domain-specific STEM content knowledge.

AB  - Objectives As an essential skill in daily clinical nursing practice, critical thinking ability has been an important objective in nursing education. Concept mapping enables nursing students connect new information to existing knowledge and integrates interdisciplinary knowledge. However, there is a lack of evidence related to critical thinking ability and concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of concept mapping in developing critical thinking in nursing education. Design This systematic review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data sources A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing concept mapping and traditional teaching method were retrieved. Review methods Data were collected by two reviewers according to the data extraction tables. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by other two reviewers. The results of meta-analysis were presented using mean difference (MD). Result Thirteen trials were summarized in the systematic review and eleven trials were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size showed that, comparing with traditional methods, concept mapping could improve subjects' critical thinking ability measured by California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), California Critical Thinking Skill Test (CCTST) and Critical Thinking Scale (CTS). The subgroup analyses showed that concept mapping improved the score of all subscales. Conclusion The result of this review indicated that concept mapping could affect the critical thinking affective dispositions and critical thinking cognitive skills. Further high quality research using uniform evaluation is required. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps measured a student's understanding of the complexity of concepts, and interrelationships. Novak and Gowin (1984) claimed that the continuous use of concept maps increased the complexity and interconnectedness of students' understanding of relationships between concepts in a particular science domain. This study has two purposes; the first one was to test this claim and examine how the repeated use of concept maps affected the complexity and interconnectedness of concepts independent of science subjects in elementary school, the second one was to compare the sensitivity of the Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997), and the Novak and Gowin (1984) grading systems for concept maps. The sample group consisted of 23 students including 14 male and 9 female students. We employed paired sample t-tests to answer the research questions, and found that the scores obtained for the fifth science unit was significantly different from the first one. Also, Novak and Gowin's (1984) scoring system was better than Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997) to evaluate complexity in students' thinking except for one of the units. We conclude that concept maps have the potential to measure change in complexity and interconnectivity of concept maps. Furthermore, repeated use of concept maps has the potential to increase the complexity and interconnectedness of student concept maps, and therefore improve their understanding of science independent of science content.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students’ concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers’ marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students’ concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students’ understanding with one student’s performance as a showcase. Teachers’ views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students’ conceptual learning.

AB  - The Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework used in the preservice teacher training program requires new approaches to the effective integration of technology in science education, highlighting the intersection of the three main domains previously mentioned (technology, pedagogy and science content knowledge) in the training of prospective teachers. To develop the pre-service teacher's confidence in using TPACK we have chosen training activities built on web based comics and mind/concept maps as our pedagogical methods. Web based comics consist of fixed sequences of images and text created and viewed through dedicated online applications. In science education, comics represent a creative alternative to present and explain a concept, phenomenon and/or a situation. Visual methods such as concept cartoons or concept maps can be used for learning new concepts or systemizing information. We have opted for these methods since communicating scientific concepts and knowledge through visual representations and using web 2.0 applications and gadgets are features which characterize the current generation of students.In this paper we describe the way in which pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the Teacher Training Program at the West University of Timisoara between the years 2014 and 2016, have acquired and evaluated TPACK while participating in the design, management and analysis of learning activities based on visual representations developed for compulsory education. Our study reveals that they consider the integration of web based comics in their teaching activities to be beneficial for presenting, explaining and assessing the concepts and phenomena taught in class, as well as for identifying and correcting misconceptions. Furthermore, our study shows that the future physics teachers have developed TPACK since an efficient integration of comics and mind maps assumes a more profound understanding of the relationship between technology, pedagogical knowledge and the scientific content taught in class.

AB  - Purpose of Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of pre-service biology teachers' metaconceptual processes that were active as they participated in metaconceptual teaching activities. Methods: Several instructional activities, including poster drawing, concept mapping, group and class discussions, and journal writing, were carried out to activate the metaconceptual processes of 32 second-grade, pre-service biology teachers in order to change their alternative conceptions regarding seed plants. Case study was used as a research method. Among the 32 participants, five participants who activated five participants who activated rich and diverse metaconceptual processes and who reflected well and clearly on their mental processes in their journals were selected for the case study. The journal entries written by these five students before, during, and after the teaching activities were used as a data source. Content analysis was used to code the journals of the preservice teachers according to the types and the content of metaconceptual processes. Results and Conclusions: The results indicated that students engaged in several types of metaconceptual activities, which can be classified under metaconceptual awareness, metaconceptual monitoring, and metaconceptual evaluation. Metaconceptual processes were activated interdependently in different forms, ranging from simpler first-order metaconceptual awareness to more sophisticated metaconceptual evaluations. Recommendations: In designing metaconceptual teaching activities, teachers should take the interdependent and multifaceted nature of these processes into consideration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A simple "stop think" approach was developed to encourage the self-assessment of learning. A key element was the requirement for students to rate their feeling of difficulty before [FOD(post)] and after [FOD(post)] completing each of three authentic anatomy and physiology concept map exercises. The cohort was divided into low- (group L) and highperforming (group H) groups (based on final subject marks). Both FOD(post) (group L) and FOD(post) (groups L and H) were significantly negatively correlated with score for some maps. A comparison of FOD(post) and FOD(post) showed that students changed their mind about difficulty in 58-70% of the completed maps. Students who changed their estimation were asked to provide explanatory comments, and an increase in difficulty was related to problems with map link generation. For students who found the maps easier, 40% of comments indicated that map generation prompted recall of information from memory. Both difficulty estimations and comments supported the contention that students were self-assessing their interaction with the concept maps. Group H was significantly older than group L, had significantly higher levels of deep strategic and deep motivational learning, and had significantly higher marks in two of three concept map exercises. Notwithstanding these differences, the results from the "stop think" approach were similar between groups, indicating that it may be appropriate for students of varying academic ability. It is suggested that "stop think" may be a useful approach to encourage student self-assessment, an important step in assisting self-regulated learning development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this study, Turkish prospective elementary science teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration has been analysed within the contexts of ecosystem knowledge, organism knowledge and interconnection knowledge (IK). In the analysis, concept maps developed by 74 prospective teachers were used. The study was carried out with prospective teachers in their final year who were enrolled in the special teaching methods course. The results show that prospective teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, energy flow and matter cycling is quite different from one another’s. In addition, the present study revealed that prospective elementary science teachers showed weak understanding of energy flow and matter, cycling and cellular respiration concepts and IK category but they had strong understanding of photosynthesis concept. Prospective teachers also experience difficulties in understanding connections between macro- and microbiological systems. The study concludes with suggestions for more meaningful biology education.

AB  - This study used a between-subjects experimental design to examine the effects of three different computer-based instructional strategies (concept map, refutation text, and expository scientific text) on science learning. Concept maps are node-link diagrams that show concepts as nodes and relationships among the concepts as labeled links. Refutational texts are designed specifically to elicit common misconceptions that learners typically hold about a particular topic, directly refute the misconceptions, and present scientific explanations as compelling alternatives. Expository scientific texts consist of texts that are written specifically to present correct scientific information. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to study one of three computer-based presentations on climate change. The dependent measures were tests of free recall and transfer. The concept map group significantly outperformed the refutational and scientific text groups on both free recall and transfer tests. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper considers the origins and development of the concept mapping methodology, a summary of its growth, and its influence in a variety of fields. From initial discussions with graduate students, through the rise of the theory-driven approach to program evaluation and the development of a theoretical framework for conceptualization methodology, the paper highlights some of the key early efforts and pilot projects that culminated in a 1989 special issue on the method in Evaluation and Program Planning that brought the method to the attention of the field of evaluation. The paper details the thinking that led to the standard version of the method (the analytic sequence, “bridging” index, and pattern matching) and the development of the software for accomplishing it. A bibliometric analysis shows that the rate of citation continues to increase, where it has grown geographically and institutionally, that the method has been used in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and that the literature had an influence on the field. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of some of the key aspects of the approach that warrant further development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study follows two groups of students (67 in all) through the 3 years of their high school biology education and examines the development of their systems thinking - specifically their models of the human body as a system. Both groups were composed of biology majors, but the students in one group also participated in a PBLbased extension program called 'Medical Systems'. Data was gathered by means of concept maps, which the students completed at four strategic stages of the learning process: beginning of 10th grade, end of 10th grade, end of 11th grade and end of 12th grade. At the end of the 3 year learning process, the students' showed more complex system models. They included a wider range of concepts in their maps, spanning hierarchy levels ranging from the molecular and cellular to the system level. We also found an increase in references to dynamic interactions, but this did not encourage the students to use cellular level processes when explaining phenomena that occur at the systems level. The impact of the PBL teaching method was strongly evident in the complexity of the Medical Systems program students' concept maps, which heavily emphasized 'hierarchy' and 'diseases' as system characteristics.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today's global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that 'knowledge' does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3-50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191-217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals' attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students' learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students' test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making.

AB  - Teachers make a difference for the outcome of their students in science classrooms. One focus in this context lies on teachers’ professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students’ performance in science. Students’ science performance was conceptualised bysystem thinkingperformance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students’ performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students’ performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers’ PCK and students’ performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students’ performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes.

AB  - This work discusses repertory grid analysis as a tool for investigating the structures of students' representations of biological concepts. Repertory grid analysis provides the researcher with a variety of techniques that are not associated with standard methods of concept mapping for investigating conceptual structures. It can provide valuable insights into the learning process, and can be used as a diagnostic tool in identifying problems that students have in understanding biological concepts. The biological concepts examined in this work are 'natural kinds' a technical class of concepts which 'appear' to have invisible 'essences' meaning carrying more perceptual weight than being perceptually similar. Because children give more weight to natural-kind membership when reasoning about traits, it would seem pertinent to apply such knowledge to deep-level research into how children reason in biology. The concept of natural kinds has a particular resonance with biology since biological kinds hold the distinction of being almost all natural kinds, such as when the same 'stuff or thing' takes many different forms. We have conducted a range of studies using a diversity of biological natural kinds, but in this paper, we wish to explore some of the theoretical underpinnings in more detail. To afford this exploration, we outline one case-study in a small group of secondary school students exploring the concept of 'equine' -- that is, what is an equine? Five positive examples were chosen to engaged with by the students and one 'outlier' with which to compare the construction process. Recommendations are offered in applying this approach to biological education research. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

Zagotavlja lahko pomembne vpoglede v učni proces in je lahko uporabljen kot diagnostično orodje za definiranje problemov, s katerimi se spoprijemajo študentje pri razumevanju bioloških konceptov. Biološki koncepti, preučeni v tem prispevku, so »naravne vrste«: tehnični razred konceptov, za katere se »zdi«, da imajo nevidne esence večzaznavne teže, kot so zaznavno podobni. Ker dajejo otroci večji pomen uvrščanju naravnih vrst, ko sklepajo o značilnostih, se zdi koristno takšno znanje aplicirati v poglobljena raziskovanja o sklepanjih otrok v biologiji. Koncept naravnih vrst ima posebno resonanco z biologijo, saj biološke vrste vsebujejo razlikovanje, da so skoraj vse naravne vrste, kot na primer takrat, ko enaka »stvar ali zadeva« zavzame več različnih oblik. Opravili smo vrsto raziskav, uporabljajoč raznolikost bioloških naravnih vrst, ampak v tem prispevku želimo podrobneje raziskati teoretične podstati. Da si lahko dovolimo to preučevanje, orišemo študijo primera majhne skupine učencev predmetne stopnje, ki so preučevali koncept »konj«, tj. kaj je konj. Izbranih je bilo pet pozitivnih primerov koncepta in en primer osamelca, s katerim si pomagajo v procesu konstrukcije. Podana so priporočila za apliciranje tega pristopa v raziskovanju biološkega poučevanja. (Slovenian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students’ understandings of particle physics. Fifty-nine year 12 (16- and 17 year-old) students from two London schools participated. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were instructed how to make a concept map and were provided with 24 topic-specific key words. Students’ concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions they represented, enumerating how many students had made each one, and by identifying errors and potential misconceptions, with reference to the specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by a majority of students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although there was evidence that some students were unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous studies in Malang, Indonesia showed that there were the failure biology learning caused by not only the low students' prior knowledge, but also biology learning model has not improved the students' critical thinking skills yet, which affected the low of cognitive learning outcomes. The learning model is required to improve students' critical thinking skills. Learning model that considered able to solve this problem is a model that combines reading, constructing concept maps, and the implementation cooperative learning type Numbered Heads Together (Remap NHT) in the classroom. This study was quasi experimental research that compared the effect of Remap NHT learning model and traditional learning in biology classroom to improve critical thinking skills at Xth grade students of senior school in Malang, Indonesia. The results showed that the implementation of Remap NHT during biology classroom showed the effect on students' critical thinking skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and purpose:Research in formative assessment often pays close attention to the strategies which can be used by teachers. However, less emphasis in the literature seems to have been paid to study the application of formative assessment designs in practice. In this paper, we argue that a formative assessment design that we callEva-Mapping, which is developed on the principles of design-based research, can be a productive starting point for disseminating and further developing formative assessment practices in outdoor science teaching. Sample, design and methods:We conducted an evaluation of the design, based on video-elicited focus group interviews with two groups of experienced science teachers. Both groups consisted of teachers who taught science outside the classroom on a regular basis. These groups watched identical video sequences which were recorded during lessons in which teachers applied the formative assessment design. These sequences focused on formative assessment in pairs, in small groups, or in whole class sessions. Afterwards, the teachers discussed each sequence. These discussions were audio recorded and later transcribed. The transcriptions were analysed using content analysis. Findings:By analysing the interview data, we identified two categories of context-determining factors that influenced the formative assessment design (namely,Resources or Lack of ResourcesandThe Outdoors) and three mechanisms that influenced the assessment process (namely,Teacher Involvement,Structure in Peer AssessmentandKnowledge Sharing). Finally, we identified four perceived outcomes of the formative assessment design:Enthusiasm,Knowledge Application,AcquirementsandInsight into the Learning Processes. Conclusion:We suggest that knowledge within the identified categories can provide useful guidelines for the future development of formative assessment in science teaching that integrates the outdoors. This is because such knowledge forms part of teachers’ perceptions regarding the acceptability and utility of the formative assessment design. In addition, our study contributes to evidence within an underexplored aspect of formal outdoor science education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - People who claim that applying Novakian concept maps in Turkish is problematic base their arguments largely upon the structural differences between the English and Turkish languages. This study aims to introduce the indexing method to eliminate problems encountered in Turkish applications of Novakian maps and to share the preliminary results of its application. For this purpose, 20 pre-service chemistry teachers who had mastered the concept-mapping method after seven weeks of intense education were asked to prepare concept maps on the topic of atoms by using both the Novakian and indexing methods. The maps were qualitatively assessed by experts regarding informational content. The participants were asked to state in writing their opinions about the indexing method. The resulting analysis revealed that the participants were able to express the relation between two concepts more realistically when they used the indexing method, and the resulting maps were much richer in informational content. Almost all participants (95%) stated that the new method was more convenient in terms of reflecting the necessary mental information. The results of the study show the indexing method to be a much more convenient and informative way of preparing concept maps for both teachers and students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction.

AB  - Grounded in the context of the significant differences in service user involvement in social work education and research between the UK and Israel, a joint project between Anglia Ruskin University in the UK and Tel-Hai College in Israel was developed. Its aim was to develop a comparative research methodology to evaluate the outcomes of service user involvement in social work education. A main tenet of our research methodology consisted of partnering with a group of older people who used health and social care services as co-researchers from each country. This co-researching methodology together with the evaluation tools worked effectively in the two respective countries. The key findings highlight that while students in both countries valued the involvement of service users in their training, this occurred more so in Israel, where this is a very new development. Students in both countries developed rich concept maps illustrating the complexity of such an involvement. Yet, while the responses of both groups to vignettes describing user involvement scenarios reflected the positive impact of such an involvement, the UK students focused on the negative impact of potential risk more so than the Israeli students.

AB  - This article considers what might be taught to meet a widely held curriculum aim of students being able to understand research in a discipline. Expertise, which may appear as a 'chain of practice', is widely held to be underpinned by networks of understanding. Scientific research expertise is considered from this perspective. Within scientific disciplines, how research is conducted to solve different problems varies with concomitant effects on the validity of the data and the strengths of the claims made. Despite this variation, the overarching concepts of validity and reliability and the underpinning and interrelated network of more specific 'concepts of evidence' are applicable to understanding a wide range of research designs and the uncertainties in the resultant data and claims. These constituent ideas, which inter alia have been validated as relevant to professional and academic expertise, form an integrated knowledge base about evidence which can be visualised on a concept map. The network of ideas underpinning research expertise across scientific disciplines is outlined. Research from explicitly teaching the concepts of evidence is reported, and the implications for teaching and learning in science-based disciplines in HE are considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This pilot study investigates the impact of a 2-week professional development Summer Institute on PK-3 teachers' knowledge and practices. This Summer Institute is a component of [program], a large-scale early-childhood science project that aims to transform PK-3 science teaching. The mixed-methods study examined concept maps, lesson plans, and classroom observations to measure possible changes in PK-3 teachers' science content knowledge and classroom practice from 11 teachers who attended the 2014 Summer Institute. Analysis of the concept maps demonstrated statistically significant growth in teachers' science content knowledge. Analysis of teachers' lesson plans demonstrated that the teachers could design high quality science inquiry lessons aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards following the professional development. Finally, examination of teachers' pre- and post-Summer Institute videotaped inquiry lessons showed evidence that teachers were incorporating new inquiry practices into their teaching, especially regarding classroom discourse. Our results suggest that an immersive inquiry experience is effective at beginning a shift towards reform-aligned science and engineering instruction but that early elementary educators require additional support for full mastery.

AB  - Background:Enhancing students’ metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts. Purpose:The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students’ metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science. Sample:A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study. Design and methods:The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him. In order to enhance the students’ metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, theMetacognitive Support Questionnaire(MSpQ) and the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire (MStQ), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light. Results:The results showed gains in theMSpQbut not in theMStQ. However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test. Conclusion:Although the quantitative data obtained from theMetacognitive Strategies Questionnairedid not show significant gains in the students’ metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students’ metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from theMetacognitive Support Questionnaireshowed that there were significant gains in the students’ perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students’ achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly.

AB  - In this study it was aimed to investigate cognitive structures of pre-service science teachers in some basic chemistry terms via word association test. Data were analyzed according to the number of responses to each key word in the word association test and concept maps were drawn according to frequencies as well as relatedness coefficient. Results of this study showed that participants' strongest part of cognitive structures within the given keywords was "compound-molecule" relation and they have weaknesses/difficulties in "ion" concept. It can be said that the abstract feature of the given concepts and the difficulties on understanding of macro and micro relations were effective on these results. Besides, according to sentence analysis participants were most likely to "define" and "describe" the knowledge but have difficulties on "comparing" and "interpreting" the knowledge. This study was conducted at the beginning of the chapter and cognitive structures of the pre-service science teachers were explored. Therefore course can be designed according to the findings of the study. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Bu çalışmada kelime ilişkilendirme testi kullanılarak fen bilgisi öğretmen adaylarının bazı temel kimya kavramları hakkındaki bilişsel yapılarının ortaya çıkarılması amaçlanmıştır. Veriler testteki her bir anahtar kelimeye verilen cevap kelime sayısına göre değerlendirilmiş ve hem frekans hem de ilişkililik katsayısına bağlı olarak çizilen kavram haritalarına göre analiz edilmiştir. Çalışmanın sonuçlarına göre katılımcıların verilen temel kavramlar ile ilgili bilişsel yapılarının en güçlü kısmının "bileşik-molekül" ilişkisi olduğu, en fazla ise "iyon" kavramı ile ilgili zayıflıklarının/eksikliklerinin bulunduğu belirlenmiştir. Bu sonuçlarda kavramların soyut oluşu ve öğrencilerin makro ve mikro ilişkileri iyi özümseyememelerinin etkili olduğu düşünülmektedir. Ayrıca katılımcıların yazdığı cümlelerin analizine göre katılımcılar bilgiyi en çok "tanımlayabilmekte" ve "betimleyebilmekte" iken, bilgiyi "kıyaslama" ve "yorumlama"da eksiklikleri vardır. Çalışma konunun başlangıcında uygulanmış ve kelime ilişkilendirme testi ile katılımcıların bilişsel yapıları ortaya konmuştur. Elde edilen verilere göre dersin tasarlanabileceği belirtilmiştir.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping (CCM) by comparing it with a paper-and-pencil approach. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a physics course. The control group drew concept maps using the paper-and-pencil method and face-to-face discussion, whereas the experimental group employed Google Docs to create concept maps and used Google Chat for discussion. Learning achievements, physics concept representation, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward CCM were examined to identify the differences between the two groups and the effectiveness of Google Docs. The results suggested that the use of Google Docs did not significantly affect physics achievement. However, Google Docs fostered physics concept representation and enhanced attitudes toward science. Moreover, the Google Docs group tended to learn more collaboratively. The students in this group also agreed with the superiority of observation and modification functions provided by the real-time co-editing mechanism and revision history. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This descriptive study examines online assessment strategies employed by preservice teacher candidates when creating thematic learning experiences in online teaching environments. Using the learning management system Moodle as part of their innovative training, this review of a sample of 395 candidate-created instructional units across all grades and most subject areas examines their use of a variety of assessment instruments to gather both formative and summative data. The large data set allowed the researcher to infer the teacher candidates' understanding of the value of different assessment types and their use in an assessment strategy for the unit. Learning management systems have many built-in affordances, including the ability for teachers to make quizzes, host discussion forums, use concept mapping, and facilitate collaborative projects using multimedia as well as text. In this study, the majority of students cautiously made use of more traditional tools such as quizzes and reports without taking full advantage of the power and potential of collaborative and creative potential in the development of authentic assessments. Analysis of these data showed that teacher candidates at the upper elementary level and in subjects like Science and Language Arts made far greater use of open-ended summative assessment activities than did other subgroupings.

AB  - It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received “Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum” instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Facilitating student growth and development in diagnosing and solving technical problems remains a challenge for technology and engineering educators. With funding from the National Science Foundation, this team of researchers developed a self-guided, computer-based instructional program to experiment with conceptual mapping as a treatment to improve undergraduate technology and engineering students' abilities to develop a plan of action when presented with real technical problems developed in collaboration with industrial partners. The pilot-testing and experimental portions of the project confirmed that the subjects found the training interesting and useful. However, the experimental data did not support the conclusion that the treatment caused an increase in diagnostic performance. Analysis of individual data demonstrated that for a portion of the sample, significant gains occurred. Qualitative analysis demonstrated that the majority of the students treated the experience as a trivial academic exercise, which seriously limited their efforts. A major step forward occurred in the ability to automatically compare student maps with the expert's reference map using a modified version of the similarity flooding algorithm. Student feedback was based on this automatic comparison. In all, the experience has encouraged the team to continue and expand the use of conceptual mapping as a tool for improving diagnostic and problem-solving skills. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The value of course evaluations has been debated since they frequently fail to capture the complexity of education and learning. Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a participant-centred mixed-method was explored as a tool for evaluation and development in nursing education and to better understand students' learning experiences, using data from a GCM-based evaluation of a research training assignment integrating clinical practice and research data collection within a Swedish university nursing program. Student nurses (n = 47) participated in a one-day GCM exercise. Focus group brainstorming regarding experiences from the assignment that the students considered important and instructive yielded 98 statements that were individually sorted based on their student-perceived relationships, and rated regarding their importance/instructiveness and need for development. Quantitative analysis of sort data produced a 2-dimensional map representing their conceptual relationships, and eight conceptual areas. Average cluster ratings were plotted relative to each other and provided a decision aid for development and planning by identifying areas (i.e., “Research methodology”, “Patients' perspectives”, and “Interviewer role”) considered highly important/instructive and in high need for development. These experiences illustrate the use and potential of GCM as an interactive participant-centred approach to evaluation, planning and development in nursing and other higher health science educations.

AB  - This pilot project aimed to explore the use of a concept mapping tool to support learning and integration in an optometry curriculum. Results suggest that faculty believe concept mapping can help students demonstrate their processing of information and ability to synthesize basic and clinical sciences. Student acceptance of the learning tool was mixed. Better acceptance by students may result if faculty incorporate the learning tool early and consistently throughout the curriculum and provide greater support and feedback to students. Further research is needed to understand any longterm benefits to student learning and clinical care. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula.

AB  - Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have yielded satisfactory results and prompted students' curiosity and interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently, whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Empirical analysis of secondary biology classrooms revealed that, on average, 68% of teaching time in Germany revolved around processing tasks. Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons pertaining to the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’. Two fundamental characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition, summary, define, classify and high level information processing: interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or concept level content). Additionally,students’ cognitive knowledge structureabout the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’ was measured using student-drawn concept maps (N = 970 students). Finally, linear multilevel models were created withhigh-level cognitive processing tasksandhigher content complexity tasksas class-level predictors andstudents’ prior knowledge,students’ interest in biology, andstudents’ interest in biology activitiesas control covariates. Results showed a positive influence ofhigh-level cognitive processing tasks(β = 0.07;p < .01) onstudents’ cognitive knowledge structure. However, there was no observed effect ofhigher content complexity tasksonstudents’ cognitive knowledge structure. Presented findings encourage the use ofhigh-level cognitive processing tasksin biology instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This two-group quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of the Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material (ONACOM) integrated with inquiry teaching and expository teaching methods. Grade 7 students' posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest-posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students' achievement and improve their attitude. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students' organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non-mediated and drawn from personal experience.

AB  - Currently, there is no agreement among scientists and science educators on whether heat should be defined as a 'process of energy transfer' or 'form of energy.' For example, students may conceive of heat as 'molecular kinetic energy,' but the interpretation of this alternative conception is dependent on educational researchers' methodology and definition of heat. The objective of this paper is to review the alternative conceptions of heat as presented in empirical studies and to examine the possible sources of this subjectivity or causes of this problem. This paper analyzes the alternative conceptions of heat based on five categories: 'residing in object,' 'ontological category,' 'movement,' 'cause and effect,' and 'condition.' The findings suggest that it could be difficult to understand the alternative conceptions when there is disagreement on the definition or description of heat. Furthermore, alternative conceptions may be traceable to linguistic usage or definitions in textbooks. Therefore, it is possible to have a misinterpretation of students' alternative conceptions.

AB  - The green chemistry course taught at Westminster College (PA) incorporates nontraditional teaching techniques and texts to educate future chemists about the importance of using green chemistry principles. The course is designed to introduce green chemistry concepts and demonstrate their inherent necessity by discussing historical missteps by the chemical industry, and future design possibilities. Students learn to apply green chemistry principles through case studies and journal article activities, while connecting all of these resources and experiences with concept maps. The final course project requires students to create their own green chemistry educational materials. This nontraditional approach to teaching chemistry provides an opportunity for students to learn in dynamic ways and to be creative in their contributions to green chemistry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The research is an experimental study which has experimental and control groups, and based on pre-test, post-test, monitoring test model. Research group consists of second and third grade students of Primary School Education and Psychological Counseling undergraduate programmes in Giresun University Faculty of Educational Sciences. The research group was formed among the students whose academic procrastination tendency is middle or high, by using academic procrastination scale. 60 students, whose academic procrastination tendencies are medium and high level, were identified. 24 students, who volunteered to participate to the study, were appointed randomly to the experimental and control groups. Academic procrastination scale was used to collect data. Scales were given to experiment and control groups as pre-test. A prevention of academic procrastination program which developed by the researcher based on Rational Emotive Behavioral Approach was applied to the experimental group. Control group was not given any training. After the training the of experiment group, post-test measurements were taken. And also 30 days after the experimental training, follow-up measurements were taken. Data were analyzed using Analyzis of Nonparametric. In the result of the applied program, a significant difference was found in favor of experiment group in academic procrastination. The results were interpreted in the light of the literature considering effects of Rational Emotive Behavioral Approach on academic procrastination. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Gesture-based learning have particularities, because learners interact in the learning process through the actual way, just like they interact in the nondigital world. It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners' learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90 participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system, conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. Learners' cognitive load was also measured and showed that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials.

AB  - This study examined the reflection interview as a tool for assessing and facilitating the use of ‘systems language’ amongst 11th grade students who have recently completed their first year of high school biology. Eighty-three students composed two concept maps in the 10th grade—one at the beginning of the school year and one at its end. The first part of the interview is dedicated to guiding the students through comparing their two concept maps and by means of both explicit and non-explicit teaching. Our study showed that the explicit guidance in comparing the two concept maps was more effective than the non-explicit, eliciting a variety of different, more specific,typesof interactions and patterns (e.g. ‘hierarchy’, ‘dynamism’, ‘homeostasis’) in the students’ descriptions of the human body system. The reflection interview as a knowledge integration activity was found to be an effective tool for assessing the subjects’ conceptual models of ‘system complexity’, and for identifying those aspects of a system that are most commonly misunderstood.

AB  - Minimal research has been accumulated in the field of social studies education for Novakian concept mapping, yet there are many benefits from adding this learning tool to a teacher's instructional toolbox. The article defines Novakian concept mapping and invites readers to adopt digital Novakian concept mapping into the social studies classroom as a means to build content knowledge, to understand what students are thinking about content, and to provide opportunities for students to make relevant and important connections within the body of knowledge defined as social studies. A concept map is like an Instagram of a student's thinking about a particular topic. Steps for teachers to teach students how to introduce and create a Novakian concept map are included in the manuscript along with sample focus questions and maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The desire to measure students’ affective and psychomotor skills along with cognitive abilities created a necessity to switch to new approaches in assessment and evaluation methods. The aim of the study is to compare the concept map and structured grid with the achievement test. The research questions are; 1) Is there a significant correlation between students’ concept map points, structured grid points and achievement test points?, 2) How is changing the students’ achievement test points, concept map activity points and structured grid points? and 3) Is there a significant difference between students’ concept map activity points and students’ structured grid activity points based on gender? The relational screening method, which is a quantitative research design is used in this study for research method. The sample of this study includes 23 sixth grade students who are being educated at Atatürk Middle School in Vezirköprü town at 2014-2015 academic year. In this study, two concept map activities and a structured grid made by researchers were applied with an achievement test which was multiple-choice test prepared by Ceylan (2008) to the students at the end of the unit. Spearman-rho test done by researchers to see the correlation between the points obtained from concept map activities, structured grid and achievement test. A high, significantly positive relationship was found between achievement test points and concept map filling activity points. A significant positive relationship was found between the achievement test and concept map creating activity points. It is can be said that, concept map activities served their purpose and they could measure the same skills with achievement test. However, there weren’t any significant relationship found between structured grid and achievement test points. It was thought that, this result occurred because of students weren’t accustomed to structured grids. There weren’t any significant relationship found between the points obtained from concept map activities and structured grid points. Descriptive analysis was performed to find answers to the second research question. It was seen in the results of the analysis that, students’ highest arithmetic mean came from achievement test. It was thought that, these results occurred because of students familiarity with multiple-choice tests. The arithmetic mean of students’ concept map filling activity points were found higher than the arithmetic mean of students’ concept map creating activity points. This result can be read as, students couldn’t create the links between concepts. Mann Whitney U test was performed to find answers to last research question. It was seen in the test results that, there weren’t any effects to these activities points’ by gender. Teachers can be informed about alternative assessment and evaluation tools. Alternative assessment and evaluation methods can be use in addition to traditional methods for evaluation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Students attending object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) courses typically encounter difficulties transitioning from requirements analysis to logical design and then to physical design. Concept maps have been widely used in studies of user learning. The study reported here, based on the relationship of concept maps to learning theory and semantic memory, suggests that integrating OOAD instruction with concept maps might help learners understand these transitions more clearly. An empirical experiment, involving two treatments based on concept maps and conventional instruction, was conducted to examine the relevance of concept map-based instruction for an effective understanding of phase transitions. The results indicate that compared with conventional instruction, concept map-based instruction is more efficient in improving learner understanding because of greater learner engagement and because of concept maps' properties when they are used as an information medium. This study can aid instructors in realizing the difficulties in learning phase transitions and motivate researchers to develop more effective learning instructions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (n = 19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (n = 23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential.

AB  - The amount of substance and its unit the mole is a basic concept in chemistry. However, previous research has shown that teaching and learning the concept are challenging tasks for both teachers and students. The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the problems which emerge in the teaching and learning process, and provide integrated suggestions for classroom instruction. By means of videotaping and interviews, the case studies explored how the mole is presented and conceptualized in two secondary classrooms in two different countries, Australia and Taiwan. Data analysis was based on a concept map and focused on how two key ideas were presented in the lessons and perceived by the students: (1) the definition of the mole, and (2) the concept of molar mass. The findings show that during the lessons on the mole, most of the time was spent on solving stoichiometric problems. Conceptually, the number aspect of the mole, that is, Avogadro's number, was emphasized; the concept of molar mass was introduced without meaningfully connecting it to the concept of relative atomic/molecular mass. Although the students were able to solve relevant problems, they could not coherently explain the relations among the concepts. Two critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole emerged: (1) the number aspect of the mole needs to be justified by its mass aspect, and (2) the connection between molar mass and relative atomic/molecular mass needs to be explicitly explained. The two components provide one explanation for students' algorithmic learning and their confusion in learning about the mole, and serve as concrete suggestions for improving classroom instruction. The study once again manifested the significance of teaching for conceptual understanding in science education. It also exemplifies how a concept map of a specific scientific concept can also be a useful analytical tool in educational research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 53: 181-214, 2016.

AB  - Summary Background Pre-registration programs have been found to insufficiently prepare nurses for working in the neurosciences specialism. Effective approaches to neurology education are important, not only to enhance motivation to learn, but also for learners to develop basic competence in handling patients with neurological problems. Objectives To demonstrate that outcome-based course design using concept mapping would bring about significant differences in the nursing students' competency, cognitive load, and learning satisfaction with the neurological care course. Methods A two-group pretest and post-test experimental study was administered. Two of the four clusters of participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group for experiencing an outcome-based course design using concept mapping, and the rest were designated the control group to be given objective-based lectures only. The Competency Inventory of Nursing Students, Cognitive Load Scale of Neurological Nursing, and Learning Satisfaction Scale of Neurological Nursing were used in this study for the students to rate their own performance. In addition, The Concept Map Scoring Scale was used in the experimental group for examining students' concept mapping ability. Results Significant increases of mean nursing competency scores in both groups from pre-test to post-test were found. There was no statistically significant difference in mean nursing competency score between the experimental group and the control groups at post-test. The mean cognitive load score of the experimental group was lower than the control group at post-test. The mean learning satisfaction scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. Conclusions This article provides that outcome-based concept mapping as educational method could encourage a group of nursing students to take a bio-psycho-social approach to medicine, which might ultimately result in better nursing care quality.

AB  - The learning orientation towards the acquisition of basic competencies represents a shift in the ways of learning. In order to solve the problems of everyday life (present and future), the emphasis is on the achievement of basic skills that integrate formal (academic), non-formal and informal learning. In addition, they attempt to encourage the development of lifelong learning. In this paper, we use the "Digital Competence" and "Learning to Learn" as a starting point for the analysis of different mobile applications (apps). The "Digital Competence" is based on the acquisition of skills to obtain, process, organize and communicate information with the intention to transform it into knowledge, using different resources and based on ICT supports. Meanwhile, the "Learning to Learn" competence is based on the acquisition of the necessary skills that allow us to regulate our own learning processes in an autonomous and efficient way. The development of this competence involves assimilation and awareness of the abilities that come into play in learning as finding, understanding, selection, analysis, synthesis and association of relevant information. According to the latest contributions of neurocognitive and constructivist psychology, mind and concept maps are highly useful strategies for the development of the competencies mentioned above. This study is based on two objectives: 1. Perform an updated review of the major scientific contributions related to the development and implementation of concept maps with educational purposes; 2. Analyse the most frequent apps that are used which allow the development of concept maps. In this way, we obtain information on the relevance and variety of work areas in which mind maps are used, defining criteria analysis for the apps. Based on these criteria, apps are analysed according to the intended purpose. The procedure used comes from a review of the most relevant scientific production on the topics addressed (250 retrieved documents), included in the database Web of Science (ISI) and Scopus. The recovered production is analysed according to the areas of knowledge, education levels, years, countries and major conclusions. In addition, we developed a matrix analysis including forty apps for the development of concept and mind maps. These apps have been analysed according to the degree of compliance with the following criteria; usability; accessibility, visual design, interaction design, portability, cost, support/setting and synchronization. Finally, the paper concludes by synthesizing the most important contributions and giving a series of recommendations for the use of mobile applications for the elaboration of concept maps with educational purposes.

AB  - Mathematical concepts are not isolated entities. They form hierarchical systems, with higher or lower levels of generality. The study undertaken for improving the system for designing teaching activities in school education combines the strategies of fundamental, historical and comparative research, which implies: - highlighting the theoretical and methodological bases needed to reconstruct the discipline didactics in the curricular spirit; - identifying the optimal correlations between general and applied pedagogy that may be operationalized at the level of a designing model, needed in the context of teaching-learning-evaluating the discipline; - analysing the applied methodologies/ didactics (of Mathematics) from a historical (synchronic-diachronic) perspective and exploiting them at the level of the new structure of the models of constructing mathematical concepts of discipline didactics mathematics; - presenting the basics of applied didactics in terms of objectives, curricular contents, training methodology, evaluation of training, the teaching-learning-evaluation actions of a discipline; designing the teaching activities at the level of some disciplines; - presenting the epistemological and psychological basics of science didactics, complementary to applied didactics, concerning the models of constructing mathematical concepts.

AB  - Concept map activities often lack a subsequent revision step that facilitates knowledge integration. This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (n=81) using an online inquirybased learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peerreview. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert-map condition focused mostly on concept-focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer-review condition used more link-focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes.

AB  - Concept mapping and retrieval practice are both educational methods that have separately been reported to provide significant benefits for learning in diverse settings. Concept mapping involves diagramming a hierarchical representation of relationships between distinct pieces of information, whereas retrieval practice involves retrieving information that was previously coded into memory. The relative benefits of these two methods have never been tested against each other in a classroom setting. Our study was designed to investigate whether or not concept mapping or retrieval practice produced a significant learning benefit in an undergraduate physiology course as measured by exam performance and, if so, was the benefit of one method significantly greater than the other. We found that there was a trend toward increased exam scores for the retrieval practice group compared with both the control group and concept mapping group, and that trend achieved statistical significance for one of the four module exams in the course. We also found that women performed statistically better than men on the module exam that contained a substantial amount of material relating to female reproductive physiology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers' classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimentala), the contemporary condition (Experimentalb), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students' discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimentala and Experimentalb conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students' scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service science teachers' conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational beliefs, and self- regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a public university in Ankara participated the study. A concept map technique was used to determine students' conceptual knowledge level of electric current. To determine students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture and then used as a measurement tool. Results showed that students' motivational beliefs were positively associated with their self-regulation, and students' task value, self-efficacy, and self-regulation were positively related with students' conceptual knowledge of electric current. These results show that students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in students' conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map technique.

AB  - As an interdisciplinary team of educational researchers we explored pre-service science teachers' perspectives on using digital technologies and social media to address socially relevant issues in science teaching. The rationale for teaching socially relevant science was embedded in the concept of renaiscience, thus underscoring the need for science to be perceived as a human activity. We drew on generational theory to consider the educational significance of digital technologies and social media. Two different activities were used to elicit the pre-service science teachers' perspectives. First, we invited them to reflect on a digital animation that we had produced, and they highlighted the advantages of digital animation as a medium to communicate a socially relevant message more appealingly to the Millennial generation. We then engaged these pre-service teachers in a structured concept-mapping activity to consider how digital technologies and social media might be used to address social challenges in South Africa. They drew our attention to the affordances of digital technologies and social media as a means to facilitate critical thinking, cater for diverse learning styles, and make high-quality scientific knowledge more accessible. They highlighted that teaching socially relevant science using digital resources can be cheap, convenient, collaborative, and creative. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers’ misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention. Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky’s theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness. Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers’ understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention. Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers’ did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers’ prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors.

AB  - If a person has ‘a problem’ to solve and knows the solution and just has to apply it (retrieve it from memory and re-act), it is not a problem—it is a task; if a person does not know the solution and has to create it—this is a problem. Using this language, there are only two situations: (a) one has to perform a task; or (b) one has to solve a problem by creating a new (for the person) procedure, i.e. one has to create a brand new (for the one) solution; of course, one must utilize some of the knowledge previously stored in the memory (we could call this action ‘creative utilization of previous knowledge’).If a student learned how to perform a task, he or she can repeat it in the future as many times as this student has to repeat the same task. The key word is ‘the same’. Our brain is a powerful pattern recognition machine. As soon as it recognizes the task, it retrieves from memory the sequence of the actions, which has to be performed to succeed. If a brain does not recognize the task, we have two options: (a) the task is the same but due to some features it is camouflaged as a different one; (b) the task is different from the ones in the past and is really new for the brain, and the brain does not have the solution (at least in full) in its storage. Of course, we assume that a particular brain is capable of storing and retrieving the information and governing the actions required for fulfilling the task (otherwise we have to discuss a case of learning disabilities).Based on this approach, every teacher has to teach students to two different practices: (a) how to perform specific tasks (the set of those tasks should be specified by a curriculum); (b) how to create a solution to a problem which has not been solved in the past (by that person); the latter practice, in turn, requires a practice in making a conclusion regarding the familiarity of the given assignment—is it the same as one from the past (is it a task?) or different (is it a problem?)? Development of such a skill also requires specific practice.Teaching how to find a solution means (in part) teaching how to recognize the old task in the new one and to apply the appropriate method (which worked in the past).Teaching how to create/invent a solution which has not been presented/trained before (at least in full) means teaching thinking creatively (a.c.a. critically). Although due to the definition of ‘creativity’the act of creating something new should be seen as the result of an insight, a teacher can help a student to get to that insight as close as possible using specific teaching tools (learning aids).Many teaching instruments of the kind have been discussed and offered by various research. For example, E F Redish (2004) offers a general framework for Physics Education Research based on modeling student thinking. ‘Teaching Introductory Physics’ by Arnold B Arons (1997) is an invaluable source of many teaching tools and techniques. Many specific teaching strategies, including examples of mapping and guided thinking one will find in the works of K Heller and P Heller (1995). A Elby (2001) provides a broad summary on helping students learn how to learn (including asking prompting questions). D Rosengrant et al (2009) offer a study of the use of diagrams, including free-body diagrams, as a helping tool for solving problems in mechanics. D Van Domelen provides a review of the use of strategy maps and thinking algorithms. An excellent recourse letter is provided by L C McDermont and E F Redish (1999). The use of concept maps in education has been discussed in details by J D Novak (1984).In these works a reader will find a description of several tools which the author finds also helpful for students learning how to solve physics problems. These tools help students to get a better understanding of how a mind of an expert problem solver works when solving a problem. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recent school science curriculum developments in many countries emphasise that scientists derive evidence for their claims through different approaches; that such practices are bound up with disciplinary knowledge; and that the quality of data should be appreciated. This position paper presents an understanding of the validity of data as a set of conceptual relationships, illustrating the application of the network of ideas and their inter-relationships necessary for the ‘thinking behind the doing’ with examples from practice. We explore ways in which this understanding of data is inherently related to underpinning disciplinary ideas. We suggest how the recognition of a conceptual basis for understanding the quality of data represents an ontological shift with respect to widespread characterisations of scientific practices which addresses some long-standing issues in science education research, policy, curricula and practice.

AB  - Background: Literature contends that a teacher’s knowledge of concept map-based tasks influence how their students perceive the task and execute the creation of acceptable concept maps. Teachers who are skilled concept mappers are able to (1) understand and apply the operational terms to construct a hierarchical/non-hierarchical concept map; (2) identify the legitimacy of the constructed concept map by verifying its graphical structure and its educational utility; and (3) determine the inherent ‘good’ and ‘poor’ qualities of the resulting graphical structure to reiterate the ‘good’ qualities and to coach and provide feedback to alleviate ‘poor’ qualities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of prospective teachers’ knowledge underpinning the technique used to construct concept maps and thus, explicate their facility to construct concept maps. Sample, Design and Methods: Data consisted of 200 concept maps constructed by prospective teachers in an elementary science methods course. Results: Analysis revealed that the prospective teachers had predominantly constructed either hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical concept maps. It is likely that their maps reflect the teaching that they themselves would have experienced in their science classrooms during their own education. Additionally, most of these concepts maps only contained the root concept and subordinate concepts and lacked directional linking lines, linking phrases, labelled lines and propositions. Conclusions: We argue that teacher educators need to assess their prospective teachers’ understanding of concept mapping in relation to the legitimacy (the nature and quality) of the end-products (graphical structures) of such practices. Prospective teachers also need to understand the educational utility of concept mapping in terms of how these end-products impact and/or effectuate learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT In secondary science education, the learning and teaching of coherent conceptual understanding are often problematic. Context-based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context-embedded learning-teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context-based lesson sequence about protein-rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th-grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context-embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective. To test the hypothesis that small group concept mapping of 4 core neonatal topics as part of a fourth-year allopathic medical student elective would improve critical thinking (CT) as measured by the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST). To describe any correlations between scores on the CCTST and the step 1 and step 2 Clinical Knowledge parts of the United States Medical Licensing Exam. Methods. Twenty-seven students participated in this pilot study during a 1-month elective. A pretest CCTST, California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), and multiple choice knowledge test (MCKT) were completed immediately before the elective began. Four weekly group sessions were held with assigned reading on each of the 4 neonatal topics. Concept mapping was performed in small groups of 4 to 6 students with a group concept map collected at the end of the exercise. A posttest CCTST and MCKT was completed after the 4 group sessions. Results. Pre-CCTST overall score was 83.9 ± 6, and post-CCTST overall score was 85.6 ± 6.9 (P = .57). Pearson correlation of USMLE step 1 and pre-CCTST showed r(25) = .276, P = .164. Pearson correlation of USMLE step 2 CK and pre-CCTST revealed r(25) = .214, P = .482. The precourse MCKT average was 35%, and the postcourse average 50% (P ≤ .001). Conclusions. A recent meta-analysis confirms this is the first report of a comparison between the increasingly common CCTST and the USMLE. We confirmed that concept mapping is a valid mechanism to teach content knowledge. Although the difference in the CCTST scores was not significant, this study could serve as an important start toward development of a curriculum devoted to teaching content and improving CT. The small number of students may have prevented us from defining a significant impact. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept mapping is a pedagogical technique that was developed in the 1970s and is being used in K–12 and postsecondary education. Although it has shown excellent results in other fields, it is still rare in political science. In this research note, I discuss the implementation and testing of concept mapping in my Advanced Introduction to International Relations course. I find that student self-reporting indicates that this approach has a positive impact on student comprehension of texts and learning in the course. I suggest improvements that I intend to implement with the technique, as well as a future research agenda. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate preservice science teachers' preferences of representational modalities when they organize knowledge with multiple representations (MR) in an argumentation-based socioscientific issue context. In order to increase knowledge in this area of research, a three session lesson unit was designed on healthy eating subject. Preservice teachers organized their knowledge about healthy eating with a web-based knowledge organization system called iKOS. iKOS incorporates three distinct representation modalities: textual (Wiki), pictorial (Event), and Concept Map. In this paper, preservice teachers' knowledge organization with MR that contributed to the knowledge base created through MR and the reasons for choosing specific type of representations to organize knowledge were investigated. A sequential mixed methods research design was employed. Data sources included logged iKOS statistics that reported the number of entries and the links between them; and an open ended questionnaire that included questions about the preservice teachers' preferences and their use of MR. Social network analysis was employed to investigate the knowledge network. Results indicated that Wiki was the most created, and both Wiki and Concept Maps contributed to knowledge base more than Event. Open coding was employed to understand the underlying reasons for representational modality choices of the preservice science teachers. Qualitative analysis results showed that the reasons for preservice teachers to choose specific type of representations were (a) the ease of representation construction, (b) creating multiple representations in one space, and (c) the appropriateness of using concept maps in learning socioscientific issues.

AB  - School science textbooks are an amalgamation of concepts collected from different fields of Science like Physics, Chemistry and Biology. The actual number of concepts in the different domains of science are enormous. Educationists have to make a decision of choosing some concept that they think are necessary for students to know at a certain age. Moreover, these concepts have to be arranged in a certain order of arrangement from first chapter to the last in a textbook. The aim of this paper is to question the ontological basis of filtering concepts from the larger world of science to placing them in a school science textbook. Through two informal studies presented in this paper, the author has tried to demonstrate that different groups of people can form concept maps of a topic that are very different in structure compared to what is given in NCERT textbook. If there are multiple ways of arranging the same set of concepts, then how do educationist validate one set of arrangement of topics against the other? The result of study puts light on the fact that currently there are no criteria available for judging the ontological validity of concepts that are present in existing textbooks in school science curriculum. The selection of topics is dependent upon limited individual knowledge base of the expert who is writing the chapter. The article briefly provides a framework by which ontology of a subject can be developed collaboratively by a community of teachers and subject matter experts. This ontology can be used as a valid guide for choosing and arranging topics in a school level science textbook. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explored the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and its development of four experienced biology teachers in the context of teaching school genetics. PCK was defined in terms of teacher content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of students’ preconceptions and learning difficulties. Data sources of teacher knowledge base included teacher-constructed concept maps, pre- and post-lesson teacher interviews, video-recorded genetics lessons, post-lesson teacher questionnaire and document analysis of teacher's reflective journals and students’ work samples. The results showed that the teachers’ individual PCK profiles consisted predominantly of declarative and procedural content knowledge in teaching basic genetics concepts. Conditional knowledge, which is a type of meta-knowledge for blending together declarative and procedural knowledge, was also demonstrated by some teachers. Furthermore, the teachers used topic-specific instructional strategies such as context-based teaching, illustrations, peer teaching, and analogies in diverse forms but failed to use physical models and individual or group student experimental activities to assist students’ internalization of the concepts. The finding that all four teachers lacked knowledge of students’ genetics-related preconceptions was equally significant. Formal university education, school context, journal reflection and professional development programmes were considered as contributing to the teachers’ continuing PCK development. Implications of the findings for biology teacher education are briefly discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students’ concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors’ approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students’ conceptions.

AB  - Reflection has recently been emphasized as a constructive pedagogical activity. However, little attention has been given to the quality of reflections that students write. In this study, we explored the reflections that students make about their knowledge organization as part of a formative learning activity. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge structures of Grade 11 physics students and their instructors using pathfinder networks (PFnets). Each student's knowledge structure was compared with the instructors' averaged knowledge structure in order to identify student misconceptions. As an intervention, students were asked to write reflections on the discrepancies between their knowledge structure and their instructors' averaged knowledge structure. The students' reflections were divided into the following three categories depending on the type of knowledge constructed in those reflections: (1) conceptual, (2) procedural, or (3) declarative. Evidence was provided by the study that reflection was an effective means of improving students' knowledge structure. However, conceptual reflections were the most effective, followed by procedural and declarative reflection. Implications for formative classroom assessment are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose-insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary ( n = 15), concept map ( n = 16), model ( n = 23), and outlined model ( n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students' learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats.

AB  - Context-based education, in which students deal with biological concepts in a meaningful way, is showing promise in promoting the development of students’ conceptual coherence. However, literature gives little guidance about how this kind of education should be designed. Therefore, our study aims at designing and evaluating the practicability of a context-based biology lesson sequence. Four design principles for conceptual coherence were defined: build upon familiar concepts; focus on core concepts; stimulate establishing connections between concepts; and reflect on these connections. These design principles have been elaborated into a lesson sequence about concepts related to cellular metabolism and the relevant connections between the concepts have been visualised in a reference concept map. The activities of teacher and students that were expected to contribute in establishing these connections were described in a research scenario. The lesson sequence was conducted in a 10th-grade class of 21 students, aged 15–16, in senior general secondary education. Data were collected from video-recordings in the classroom. The observed activities of the teacher and students were compared with the intended activities. The findings show that a research scenario is a powerful tool to systematically evaluate the design and to provide information for improving it. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the effect of teacher read-aloud on adolescent learning in science and variation according to individual reading ability. The study gathered both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis from 2 treatment procedures. All seventh and eighth grade students participated in 2 consecutive units of study: 1 unit requiring students to read the science text silently and the second unit providing a teacher read-aloud of all text. The classroom procedures, assignments, and related activities were exactly the same for both treatments. Student learning was measured with pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest concept map scores on each unit of study. A survey administered at the end of the study examined student attitudes toward the teacher read-aloud and served as the source for in-depth interviews concerning preference for or dislike of the teacher read-aloud strategy. A repeated measures analysis suggested both teacher read-aloud and silent reading were appropriate for student learning but results do not support either method as superior over the other. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on the posttest and delayed posttest scores as the dependent measured, had a significant relationship between treatment by reading ability interaction on one analysis. Regression equations constructed for each level of the treatment indicated that as reading ability increases, students received more benefits from the teacher read-aloud procedure. A correlation compared reading ability with attitude toward teacher read-aloud. Seventy-eight of the participants had a positive attitude toward the intervention, with no students reading below the 50th percentile showing disapproval. Interview responses supported these results since all below average readers favor the oral presentation. Overall themes from the interviews offered advantages and disadvantages of teacher read-aloud, suggestions for implementation, and a teacher's perspective on practical applications in science classes.

AB  - Concept maps have been used to help students with learning disabilities (LD) improve literacy skills and content learning, predominantly in secondary school. However, despite increased access to classroom technology, no previous studies have examined the efficacy of computer-based concept maps to improve learning from informational text for students with LD in elementary school. In this study, we used a concurrent delayed multiple probe design to evaluate the interactive use of computer-based concept maps on content acquisition with science and social studies texts for Hispanic students with LD in Grades 4 and 5. Findings from this study suggest that students improved content knowledge during intervention relative to a traditional instruction baseline condition. Learning outcomes and social validity information are considered to inform recommendations for future research and the feasibility of classroom implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - A thorough understanding of signal analysis is important for learning many specialized electrical engineering fields such as communication and digital signal processing. To date there has been a great deal of effort by engineering educators across the world to make this course easy to understand. However, the abstract and complex mathematical nature of the concepts involved in signal analysis and the disconnection of these concepts from daily life continue to pose a challenge in conceptually understanding signal analysis. This study addresses the mistakes and learning hurdles faced by electrical engineering undergraduate students while learning signal analysis and suggests possible reasons for these misconceptions and learning hurdles. The results of this study are established with the difficulties that appeared throughout the development of a detailed concept map of signal analysis using Fourier analysis techniques; during discussions with the experts in signal analysis; and from student responses to the questions in class tests and later during individual interviews. This study identifies the difficulties in conceptually learning signal analysis that arise from insufficient understanding of: (1) the difference between continuous and discrete domains, (2) discrete frequency, (3) units of Fourier series and Fourier transforms, (4) periodic/aperiodic or finite/infinite duration signals, (5) sampling, (6) aliasing and folding, (7) abstract mathematical concepts, and (8) advanced mathematical thinking ability. A few possible explanations for these learning hurdles are various p-prims, ontological miscategorization of discrete and continuous domain signals, and the lack of ability among students for advanced mathematical thinking. The knowledge of difficult concepts and the reasons behind the difficulties in learning signal analysis related topics is necessary for the design of an appropriate pedagogy for signal analysis related courses. While teaching signal analysis, careful attention to these learning hurdles and the possible related explanations will help to establish meaningful learning among students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Knowledge is not simply a collection of facts, principles, and formulas; instead, meaningful knowledge is organized around core concepts that guide peoples' thinking about a subject. Therefore, knowledge organization is recognized as an important component of understanding learning and teaching. In this research, knowledge organization of two physics university textbooks was compared with that of four physics university teachers. The topic studied was magnetostatics with an emphasis on two topics of Biot-Savart law and Ampère's law. The aim of study was to examine the structural features of the subject matter knowledge of teachers and textbooks. For this reason, concept maps were utilized to picture clearly their knowledge organizations. Concept maps were evaluated by means of a focus on their structural characteristics including hierarchy and clustering. Results indicate that the hierarchical organizations between knowledge of teachers and textbooks vary from one topic to another. The hierarchical organizations of teachers are more comparable to textbooks for the topic of Biot-Savart law. The clustering behaves in a very similar way in the case of patterns between textbooks and teachers for both topics. It was observed that the knowledge arrangements of Ampère's law were more hierarchical, while the knowledge organizations of Biot-Savart were more clustered. Moreover, structural properties varied from one topic to another, even though topics belong to the same context. The possibility of recognizing such difference in knowledge organization is a first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solutions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: In this investigation, the construct of perceptual similarity was explored in the dysarthrias. Specifically, we employed an auditory free-classification task to determine whether listeners could cluster speakers by perceptual similarity, whether the clusters mapped to acoustic metrics, and whether the clusters were constrained by dysarthria subtype diagnosis. Method: Twenty-three listeners blinded to speakers’ medical and dysarthria subtype diagnoses participated. The task was to group together (drag and drop) the icons corresponding to 33 speakers with dysarthria on the basis of how similar they sounded. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) modeled the perceptual dimensions underlying similarity. Acoustic metrics and perceptual judgments were used in correlation analyses to facilitate interpretation of the derived dimensions. Results: Six clusters of similar-sounding speakers and 3 perceptual dimensions underlying similarity were revealed. The clusters of similar-sounding speakers were not constrained by dysarthria subtype diagnosis. The 3 perceptual dimensions revealed by MDS were correlated with metrics for articulation rate, intelligibility, and vocal quality, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows (a) feasibility of a free-classification approach for studying perceptual similarity in dysarthria, (b) correspondence between acoustic and perceptual metrics to clusters of similar-sounding speakers, and (c) similarity judgments transcended dysarthria subtype diagnosis.

AB  - This article presents the results of the evaluation of SCIViS – a visualization-based scientific information retrieval (IR) system. SCIViS is based on the logic of concept maps and enables the visualization of relationships among descriptors and authors of scientific papers. It creates an interactive interface between the user’s cognitive space and document information space. The system was evaluated by the group of 138 psychology students which have performed a variety of search tasks, using both the classic text-based and the visualization based IR systems. The SCIViS model has proved to be effective and intuitive. Participants were more efficient using the visual IR system, particularly when performing tasks requiring modifications of the initial query and finding alternative keywords. User responses indicated that system’s speed and ease of use are the most important attributes of the overall assessment. They also revealed the impact of users’ previous experience with IR systems on users’ satisfaction and perception of usefulness. Previous experience may be regarded both as the rate of success in performing search tasks, as well as the familiarity with popular search engines. The later one seems to be an important factor in modeling users’ information seeking behavior and their attitudes toward alternative IR models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study was conducted to show the effectiveness of concept mapping as a teaching strategy to undergraduate students taking introductory physics course. A number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of concept mapping on student academic achievement. The main focus of these studies have been on comparing the effectiveness of concept mapping to traditional teaching practices such as the lecture method. This research, however, compared concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion. A sample of seventy (70) students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of thirty five (35) students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group's test scores. The mean score for the experimental group's post test was higher than the mean score of the control group. This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy. Questionnaires and interviews were also used to determine the attitude of students towards concept mapping. The findings showed that students had a positive attitude towards the use of concept mapping. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Virtual Forest is a web-based, open-access learning environment about forests designed for primary-school pupils between the ages of 10 and 13 years. It is pedagogically designed to develop an understanding of ecology, to enhance conceptual development and to give a holistic view of forest ecosystems. Various learning tools, such as concept maps, activating questions, self-assessment, and other exercises, can be implemented to achieve these goals. The information is presented using the capabilities of hypermedia. The interactive systematic wholeness of nature is presented for the learners, within the context of a forest ecosystem and with examples of a few core ecological phenomena, including the cycling of matter, the flow of energy and population dynamics. The e-learning environment is designed to be used for blended learning, together with face-to-face instruction. Virtual Forest is about Finnish forests, but the pedagogical framework can be adapted for biological education in general. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the past two decades, science educators increasingly have become interested in the role of language in the learning of science and have drawn on the work of Bakhtin, among others, for understanding the dialogical nature of knowledge in a sociocultural framework. However, the nature of language and its relation to thinking have not substantially changed and, in many ways, are incommensurable with the cultural-historical, materialist dialectical underpinning of the original framing of the sociocultural and dialogical approaches in the theories of L. S. Vygotsky and M. M. Bakhtin and his circle (e.g., V. N. Vološinov). Most importantly, currently available analyses of science classroom talk do not appear to exhibit sufficient appreciation of the fact that words, statements, and language are living phenomena, that is, they inherently change in speaking. In this paper, I begin by working out the premise that language is a living phenomenon that changes in use. I then present two key insights on language-in-use that derive from the works of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle, which are used to develop a theoretical and methodological frame. These key insights and the theoretical aspects of this paper are exemplified with materials from a concept mapping session in a 12th-grade physics course. The proposed model has considerable implications for theorizing the relation between classroom talk and formal written genres of expression, and gives rise to many new research questions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework (n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development.

AB  - It is possible that e-textbook readers and tablet PC's will become mainstream reading devices in the future. However, knowledge about instructional design in this field of learning sciences is inadequate. This study aimed to analyse how two factors, that is, presentation methods and concept maps, interact with cognitive load and learning outcomes when the contents of e-textbooks are compiled. Further, it endeavored to suggest an adequate logic of instructional design based on the findings. An empirical method was adopted, and 78 participants -- either undergraduates or graduates in college -- were recruited. Regarding the compilation of e-textbooks, the findings can be summarised as follows: (a) Providing concept maps not only reduces learners' cognitive load but also enhances their learning outcomes of cognition, affection, and psychomotor performance. (b) Overall, video (V) is superior to text and diagram interaction (TDI) in terms of learning outcomes, and TDI is superior to text and diagram (T&D). Nevertheless, within the cognitive domain, learning outcomes produced by V are not necessarily superior to those produced by TDI. When learners are not provided with concept maps, TDI is superior to V in terms of learning outcomes. Conversely, if learners are provided with concept maps, V is superior to TDI.

AB  - As John Brekke has observed, social work does not use the word “science” to define itself, suggesting a need to articulate a science of social work. This article discusses the science of social work and its relationship to social work practice in the United States, arguing that a “rapprochement” between practice and science should be effected to their mutual benefit. It begins by unpacking both the definitions of social work and of science; considers epistemologies; and underlines the importance of theory in social work science and practice. The article concludes with ideas for identifying common ground and enhancing the practices of both scientists and practitioners in our field. These suggestions include acknowledging shared aims of improving care and services, fully embracing methodological pluralism, using theories and exploring domains within the field that are important to both practitioners and scientists, developing sustainable structures where scientists and practitioners can come together on an equal footing to learn from each other and to collaborate in practice-relevant research, and developing a knowledge broker service for practitioners.

AB  - Three themes are central to preparing doctoral students for the professoriate: identity formation, scientific integration, and intellectual communities. In this article, we argue that these three themes are not separate pillars but interlocking circles. Our main thesis is that (1) social work must develop into a distinct integrative scientific discipline; (2) this recognition is core to the identity formation of doctoral scholars and, reflectively, their identity formation is central to the future development of social work as a scientific discipline; and (3) the sustainability of social work as a scientific discipline is dependent upon the development of intellectual communities. Developing social work as an integrative discipline will foster and congeal the identity of our scholars while allowing them to flourish within intellectual communities. Implications include nurturing a scientific sense of identity through a dialogical approach to doctoral education, creating and supporting intellectual communities, and making identity formation explicit in mentoring practices.

AB  - Concept mapping is a powerful instructional technique that enables students to visualize connections and relationships among different concepts. It is also widely regarded as one of the most effective teaching and learning tools for knowledge organization, representation, and elicitation. This exploratory study focuses on applying the concept mapping technique to promote and foster active learning in engineering dynamics - a high-enrollment, high-impact, and foundational undergraduate engineering course that nearly all students in mechanical, aerospace, civil, biological, and biomedical engineering programs are required to take. This paper describes how the concept mapping technique was implemented in an engineering dynamics course taught by the author of this paper. Throughout the 16-week semester, students learn eight topics in dynamics - Topic 1: Kinematics of a particle; Topic 2: Kinetics of a particle: force and acceleration, and so on. Students were asked to develop their own concept maps after each topic was taught. By the end of the semester, each student had developed eight concept maps covering eight topics in dynamics. Four example concept maps that were developed by students are provided in the paper. An end-of-the-semester questionnaire survey was administrated to solicit students' feedback on their experiences with concept mapping activities. Representative student comments and recommendations are presented in the paper. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - One critical aspect that hinders the systematic use of concept mapping in everyday classrooms is the difficulty of providing high-quality feedback to students so as to keep improving and revising their concept maps (Cmaps). The development of an innovative way to analyse, at a glance, students' Cmaps is presented to allow a diagnostic assessment of student conceptual learning. This paper proposes Neighbourhood Analysis (NeAn) as an innovative way to foster meaningful learning through the identification of Limited or Inappropriate Propositional Hierarchies (LIPHs) in Cmaps. The instructional strategy that underlies NeAn involves the selection of a compulsory concept (CC), which must be a threshold concept addressing the Cmap's focal question. The goal is to estimate students' understanding of the subject, in order to detect the presence (or absence) of LIPHs. We analysed 69 Cmaps from a higher education setting and found that 175 propositions were related to the CC. This subset of all propositions was enough for instructors to provide specific highquality feedback to their students, even under normal teaching conditions. NeAn is a straightforward way to identify LIPHs allowing instructors to make diagnostic assessments of students' conceptual outcomes during the learning process, and to track the effects of their instructional options. NeAn can be meaningfully applied for assessing science students at secondary level and above, with special potential applicability across science subjects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to follow up on the research conducted by Ho, Wang, and Cheng (2013) and to develop a model of the scientific imagination using group concept mapping. Participants included five outstanding elementary school teachers and four researchers from southern Taiwan. The framework developed by Trochim (1989) was used as the basis for the construction of concept mappings of the scientific imagination through five panel discussions among the experts. A review of the literature, qualitative interviews, classroom observation, and document analyses were performed on group concept mapping, and independent relevant documents were used for data validation. A qualitative method was employed for data analysis. Finally, we developed the personality, developmental process, picture-in-mind, and surroundings (3PS) model of scientific imagination. Research results indicated that the scientific imagination model not only enhanced understanding of scientific imagination but also applied to daily experiences. The results of the present study are relevant to future projects and research in this domain, including the development of academic-based checklists to foster scientific imagination, the establishment of appropriate assessment tools, and the formulation of a specific curriculum for teaching the concept of scientific imagination.

AB  - Chemistry courses remain a challenge for many undergraduate students. In particular, first-semester organic chemistry has been labeled as a gatekeeper with high attrition rates, especially among students of color. Our study examines a key factor related to conceptual understanding in science and predictive of course outcomes-knowledge structures. Previous research on knowledge structures has focused on differences between experts and novices. Given the increasing ethnic diversity of college classrooms and research indicating unique differences in certain higher order cognitive processes associated cultural practices and ethnicity, it is important to investigate whether similar patterns exist with respect to knowledge structures. Our study utilized concept maps to measure knowledge structures. Two separate analyses where performed to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students' organize their knowledge of organic chemistry content in structurally different ways. The first analysis utilized concept map proposition scoring to examine the influence of prior science achievement and ethnicity on knowledge structures. The second analysis examined holistic map structures to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students show qualitatively distinct structures overall. Results show significant mean differences on concept map proposition scores related to both prior science achievement and ethnic group membership. However, examination of holistic structures revealed that students' qualitative holistic structures did not vary by ethnic group membership. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in students' knowledge structures are related to prior science achievement across ethnic groups, not qualitative differences in the ways ethnically diverse students' structure knowledge. Implications for teaching and learning in organic chemistry are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 51: 741-758, 2014 [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Improving students scientific explanations is one major goal of science education. Both writing activities and concept mapping are reported as effective strategies for enhancing student learning of science. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a teaching model, named the DCI model, which integrates a Descriptive explanation writing activity, Concept mapping, and an Interpretive explanation writing activity, is introduced in a 4th grade science class to see if it would improve students' scientific explanations and understanding. A quasi-experimental design, including a non-randomized comparison group and a pre- and post-test design, was adopted for this study. An experimental group of 25 students were taught using the DCI teaching model, while a comparison group received a traditional lecture teaching. A rubric and content analysis was used to assess students' scientific explanations. The independent sample t test was used to measure difference in conceptual understanding between the two groups, before and after instruction. Then, the paired t test analysis was used to understand the promotion of the DCI teaching model. The results showed that students in the experimental group performed better than students in the comparison group, both in scientific concept understanding and explanation. Suggestions for using concept mapping and writing activities (the DCI teaching model) in science classes are provided in this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We evaluate a new approach to teaching the basic biochemistry mechanisms that regulate the biology of Triatominae, major vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. We have designed and used a comic book, "Carlos Chagas: 100 years after a hero's discovery" containing scientific information obtained by seven distinguished contemporary Brazilian researchers working with Triatominaes. Students (22) in the seventh grade of a public elementary school received the comic book. The study was then followed up by the use of Concept Maps elaborated by the students. Six Concept Maps elaborated by the students before the introduction of the comic book received an average score of 7. Scores rose to an average of 45 after the introduction of the comic book. This result suggests that a more attractive content can greatly improve the knowledge and conceptual understanding among students not previously exposed to insect biochemistry. In conclusion, this study illustrates an alternative to current strategies of teaching about the transmission of neglected diseases. It also promotes the diffusion of the scientific knowledge produced by Brazilian researchers that may stimulate students to choose a scientific career. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explored elementary pre-service teachers' content knowledge for dissolving before and after an instructional intervention over a 15-week science methods course. Pre-service teacher knowledge was examined using pre/post concept maps (Cmaps) and drawings with narrative descriptions. A mixed methods approach was used for both data collection and analysis. All data were thematically analyzed and a paired f-test was conducted on all collected pre- and post- Cmaps. Results of the study showed that prior to the study, pre-Cmap data indicated that participants held misconceptions and scientific conceptions, while post-Cmap data revealed an 86% improvement in knowledge with substantial gains for scientific concepts (e.g., rate, reversibility, solutes/solvents, solution, and homogeneous distribution of particles). The f-test showed statistically significant differences between pre/post Cmap scores (t = -5.071, p < .001) with the instructional intervention larger for post-Cmap scores (M = 3.58; SD = 2.561) than for pre-Cmap scores (M = 0.67; SD = 1.278). The effect size was very large. Analysis of drawings and narratives demonstrated knowledge of the hydration shell structure and the concept that dissolving is a reversible process (76%). This study suggests that pre-service teachers may possess a mosaic of conceptual understanding that is not scientifically valid and that significant remediation through concrete learning experiences may be required to elevate prior knowledge before introducing abstract concepts.

AB  - This paper presents a study of the higher order thinking involved in the delivery of computer science courses. The study involved two phases. In the first phase, a preliminary study was conducted to evaluate higher order thinking skills among the computer science students exposed to conventional teaching and learning. The results of the preliminary study revealed an obvious lack in the acquisition of higher order thinking by the students at the end of a course. The second phase of the study involved the development and evaluation of the Web-based learning system that is intended to promote higher order thinking skills in a technology-enabled learning environment. Several attributes of the system were studied, including the usability of the system in terms of its design to support outcome-based learning, learning strategies in promoting higher order thinking skills, collaborative learning, motivation and user control. Despite some weaknesses in the system, the results obtained were quite positive, indicating the potential of such a system to be used on a wider scale for the promotion of higher order thinking skills in computer science education.

AB  - Environmental education in the 21st century requires well-instructed teachers with teaching and communication abilities. This paper presents an educational experience developed in several biology and environmental teacher training courses and focused on the treatment of environmental education as a transversal educational topic. For that aim, text analysis techniques, concept mapping and informatics tools have been used to represent individual and collaborative knowledge about environmental topics. 69 students participated in the research. Data about the educational activities developed by the participants have been collected. Furthermore, students have expressed their opinions on the formative process by means of an opinion survey. The outcomes of this study reveal that future teachers and environmental educators consider that concept mapping is a valuable tool to represent their knowledge about environmental education, to encourage reflexive and collaborative learning, to improve teaching communicative abilities and to use effectively ICT in the classroom.

AB  - This paper presents a model of how children generate concrete concepts from perception through processes of differentiation and integration. The model informs the design of a novel methodology (evolutionary mapsoremaps), whose implementation on certain domains unfolds the web of itineraries that children may follow in the construction of concrete conceptual knowledge and pinpoints, for each conception, the architecture of the conceptual change that leads to the scientific concept. Remarkably, the generative character of its syntax yields conceptions that, if unknown, amount to predictions that can be tested experimentally. Its application to the diurnal cycle (including the sun's trajectory in the sky) indicates that the model is correct and the methodology works (in some domains). Specifically, said emap predicts a number of exotic trajectories of the sun in the sky that, in the experimental work, were drawn spontaneously both on paper and a dome. Additionally, the application of the emaps theoretical framework in clinical interviews has provided new insight into other cognitive processes. The field of validity of the methodology and its possible applications to science education are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Concept mapping is widely used to facilitate learning tool to help students organize information, improve long-term retention and increases student achievement. Student generated concept maps have been recommended for studying content area materials, because the learner plays an active role in creating and modifying the concept map. It is an important classroom pedagogy that promotes development of self-learning. This study aims to compare the effect of concept maps between construct-by-self, construct-on-scaffold and construct by paper-and-pencil on students' comprehension in electricity. Forty-seven high school students were evaluated by a pre-post-test design. Four tenth grade science classes of students at a high school were assigned to three treatment groups. Assessment tests focused on whether the student has acquired the knowledge that is a part of the objectives using concept maps, but also find out what the students knows, understands, or is able to achieve on his own. Group I, individually concept mapped which was used to track their understanding of electricity. Group II, those who used fill in the blank concept map, within which some nodes and links were set as blanks for the scaffold. Group III, construct by paper-and-pencil with the assistance of the feedback The findings revealed that fill in the blank concept maps on computers positively influenced concept learning compared to those who used individually generating concept maps. The two computer-based procedures are helpful for students in completing their concept maps than constructing with paper-and-pencil. According to interview all students were agreed that concept maps were practical method to determine relationships among concepts, sharpened their conceptual understandings and increased their critical thinking.

AB  - In order to use concept maps in physics classes effectively, teachers' knowledge and ideas about concept mapping are as important as the physics knowledge used in mapping. For this reason, we aimed to examine pre-service physics teachers' knowledge on concept mapping, their ideas about the implementation of concept mapping in physics classes, the hidden elements influencing their ideas, and the relations between knowledge and ideas, qualitatively. The participants of this study were eight pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the physics education department at two state universities. The results of the interviews conducted with the participants and their artifacts revealed that although pre-service physics teachers had basic knowledge about concept mapping, they had some negative ideas about implementation in physics classes. Furthermore, language, limitation in assessment, limitation in expressions, and teacher's knowledge were identified as the sources of pre-service physics teachers' negative ideas.

AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled "Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)" has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students' learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper reports on teachers' use of concept mapping as an alternative assessment strategy in advanced level biology classes and its effects on students' cognitive skills on selected biology concepts. Using a mixed methods approach, the study employed a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design involving 156 students and 8 teachers from intact classes. A researcher-constructed Biology Cognitive Skills Test was used to collect the quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected through interviews and students' personal documents. The data showed that the participants utilized concept mapping in various ways and they described positive experiences while being engaged in its use. The main challenge cited by teachers was the limited time available for more consistent use. The results showed that the use of concept mapping in advanced level biology can lead to learning gains that exceed those achieved in classes where mainly traditional methods are used. The students in the concept mapping experimental groups performed significantly better than their peers in the control group on both the lower-order (F(1) = 21.508;p < .001) and higher-order (F(1) = 42.842,p < .001) cognitive items of the biology test. A mean effect size of .56 was calculated representing the contribution of treatment to the students' performance on the test items. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The "mole" is a fundamental concept in quantitative chemistry, yet research has shown that the mole is one of the most perplexing concepts in the teaching and learning of chemistry. This paper provides a survey of the relevant literature, identifies the necessary components of a sound understanding of the mole concept, and unpacks and presents these components in the form of a concept map. The concept map incorporates the atomic-molecular concept with the mole concept, and connects the two concepts by two linking ideas: the number aspect of the SI definition (linking idea 1) and the connection between relative atomic-molecular mass and molar mass (linking idea 2). This concept map not only provides a conceptual framework for making meaning in relation to the mole but also sheds some light on how the concept might be better taught and learned.

AB  - Concept mapping is a powerful instructional technique that enables students to visualize connections and relationships among different concepts. It is also widely regarded as one of the most effective teaching and learning tools for knowledge organization, representation, and elicitation. This exploratory study focuses on applying the concept mapping technique to promote and foster active learning in engineering dynamics - a high-enrollment, high-impact, and foundational undergraduate engineering course that nearly all students in mechanical, aerospace, civil, biological, and biomedical engineering programs are required to take. This paper describes how the concept mapping technique was implemented in an engineering dynamics course taught by the author of this paper. Throughout the 16-week semester, students learn eight topics in dynamics - Topic 1: Kinematics of a particle; Topic 2: Kinetics of a particle: force and acceleration, and so on. Students were asked to develop their own concept maps after each topic was taught. By the end of the semester, each student had developed eight concept maps covering eight topics in dynamics. Four example concept maps that were developed by students are provided in the paper. An end-of-the-semester questionnaire survey was administrated to solicit students' feedback on their experiences with concept mapping activities. Representative student comments and recommendations are presented in the paper. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Knowledge structure is an important aspect for defining students' competency in biology learning, but how knowledge structure is influenced by the teaching process in naturalistic biology classroom settings has scarcely been empirically investigated. In this study, 49 biology lessons in the teaching unit blood and circulatory system in 9th grade German classrooms were videotaped and analyzed. Before the lesson, a questionnaire was administered to the students to solicit their responses about learning motivation. After the lesson, students' learning outcomes on knowledge structure were examined with the concept mapping method. The video coding used in this study focused on the knowledge linking levels during the biology lesson. Out of the 49 classes, those with the highest and those with the lowest linking levels were selected based on the coding results. In high-linking classes, interrelated facts were introduced more often in the lessons, whereas in the lessons of the low-linking classes, isolated pieces of knowledge were predominant. The results from the concept mapping task showed that the students in the high-linking classes constructed more correct relations among the concepts compared to the students in the low-linking classes. The results remained stable even after controlling for learning motivation. These findings confirm the importance of teaching interrelated facts and concepts instead of isolated facts for fostering students' knowledge structure. As a result, based on the Bavarian biology curriculum, we develop materials and programs to enable students, student teachers, and teachers to focus on interrelated facts and basic concepts instead of isolated facts in biology lessons.

AB  - Project Clarion, a Jacob K. Javits-funded project, focused on the scale-up of primary-grade science curricula. Curriculum units, based on an Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM), were developed for high-ability learners, but tried out with all students in Title I settings to study the efficacy of the units with all learners. The units focus on the development of students’ conceptual understanding to undergird science content attainment. Teaching and learning models, such as concept formation and concept mapping were used to scaffold science learning and reasoning for appropriate curriculum differentiation. Science content mastery was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reasoning skills were measured using the Test of Critical Thinking. Understanding of macro-concepts and content attainment were measured by curriculum-embedded performance-based assessments. Students with the ICM outperformed students without the specialized curriculum in science content and reasoning skills, and showed greater growth in both conceptual understanding and content attainment.

AB  - Abstract: Physical education and health education are relevant avenues for adolescents to learn knowledge and behavior related to energy-balanced living. Grounded in the framework theory of conceptual change, this study examined ninth graders' energy balance knowledge (i.e., concepts, principles, and strategies underlying the scientific mechanism and the outcome of energy balanced/imbalanced living) and physical activity in a healthful-living curriculum (i.e. combination of physical education and health). The students (N =195) were measured using concept mapping, accelerometers, and three-day physical activity recall. It was found that the students differed in energy balance knowledge where most (83%) lacked a higher-order relational understanding. Physical activity in physical education class or after school did not significantly differ by students' mental model levels concerning energy balance knowledge. The findings suggest that an ecological learning context with moderate physical activity should be provided to help students make sense of energy balance knowledge through lived experiences.

AB  - This review assesses the use of anthropological theories in the examination of low-wage work. Due to the vast differences existing between different cultures in low-wage work, this review focuses on theories that have been applied in Western, and mainly American, contexts. There are primarily three fields from which this literature is drawn: economic anthropology, gender and race anthropology, and theories of power—the last integrates all these theories. Differences and controversies over the applicability of these theories are also highlighted. The review concludes with a conceptual map describing the interrelatedness of these theories and how they explain the realities of low-wage workers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science teachers should know basic science concepts and associations between them in terms of successful concept instruction. It is also important for prospective science teachers to know these basic concepts and associate them properly. In this research, it is aimed to determine associations of electricity concepts taking part in science and technology curriculums by prospective science teachers; teachers in a near future. Basic concepts partaking in the unit of 'Electricity in Our Life' were designated and it was asked for 3rd class students (n=55) studied in Science Teaching Program at Karadeniz Technical University to prepare a concept map by using these concepts. Associations were written as a text and classified by researchers as false, partly true and meaningless. It is seen that participants have difficulties in association of electricity concepts, use some alternative concepts, do not associate all of the given concepts and add associations about some concepts that were not given. It is suggested that teachers and lecturers should use these concepts carefully, direct students to accurate sources; develop concept association oriented materials and implement them.

AB  - Environmental, economic, and social trends suggest the need for more sustainable ways of thinking and patterns of behaviour. Such a shift would require humanity to function at high levels of ecological literacy, which relies on a certain amount of scientific literacy. However, troubling evidence indicates an international pattern of student disengagement with science at the secondary level. Evidence also suggests that it is difficult to integrate environmental or sustainability education at this level, both within New Zealand and elsewhere. This research was aimed at examining the use of a novel approach, using permaculture, in junior secondary science (Years 9 and 10) to enhance students’ ecological and scientific literacy, as well as their attitudes toward studying science in school.Permaculture is an ecological design system based on science and ethics. A permaculture approach to science education involves eco-design thinking, as well as the use of local permaculture properties and practitioners, and the science behind common permaculture practices. The approach is also meant to be relevant and engaging, and to promote systems thinking. This study involved the design and delivery of an intervention based on permaculture principles to one Year 10 science class in New Zealand.Research took the form of a naturalistic, interpretive, mixed methods case study, which included the use of questionnaires, interviews, and observations. Data collection focused on the impacts of a permaculture approach on the teaching and learning of science, on students’ ecological literacy, and on students’ attitudes toward learning science in school. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires probed students’ opinions on the environment, science, and learning science in school, and tested their sustainable thinking and systems thinking with concept mapping and SOLO Taxonomy exercises. Classroom observations took place over the course of 12 weeks, on average 3 days per week, totalling 31 days. Before and after some classroom visits, I had informal conversations with the teacher, along with three formal interviews before, during and after the intervention. Three focus groups of students were interviewed immediately following the intervention.Findings show that a permaculture approach to junior secondary science can impact positively on students’ understanding of science and sustainability, and may impact on their attitudes toward studying science in school. It also appeared to impact positively on the science teacher'sattitude toward including sustainability in his teaching practice, and on his own sustainability learning. Regarding both students and teachers, a permaculture approach appears to have been effective to cultivate attitudes and trellis learning.The teacher and the students responded favourably to many aspects of the intervention, including the overall focus on the environment, the field trips, and some classroom learning activities. The teacher reported appreciating the way the intervention contextualised science with real world examples. Most students reported appreciating the experiential aspects of the intervention, as well as the relevance that a permaculture approach to science education provided. Findings indicate that advances in ecological and scientific literacy varied among students. Some students appeared to: improve their use of science and sustainability vocabulary; become more aware of select socio-scientific issues; better recognise scientific and ecological limits and possibilities. Some students also showed advances in sustainable thinking and systems thinking. Although many students expressed concern about issues such as pollution, wildlife, and genetic engineering — and prioritised protecting the environment over making money — there appeared to be a disconnect between these feelings and a sense of personal responsibility to act. Most students reported enjoying ... [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - In Science and Technology teaching, it is significant to contribute to the meaningful learning of concepts by making use of technologically supported techniques so that the students can construct knowledge correctly in their minds. Concept mapping, one of these techniques, is a visual technique that can reflect a presentation of concepts related to a subject and correlations among them in a hierarchical order. Founding interconceptual relations correctly is required for meaningful learning. It is essential that Science and Technology teachers learn how to use and apply concept mapping techniques in Science and Technology course so that the students could prepare concept maps well. Within this scope, in-service training seminars were held in 7 cities of Turkey, one city from each region where the Science and Technology course teachers are the highest in number. The subjects of the seminars were; "Science and Technology Teaching in scope of Constructivist Approach" "Concept Mapping Technique in Science and Technology Teaching, "Studies towards Practice of Concept Maps", "The Inspiration Program and How to Use It", "Practice Samples Prepared with the Inspiration Concept Mapping Software". Total duration of the seminar equals to 1,5 workday or 8 hours. The seminars were held in İzmir, Erzurum, Ankara, Diyarbakır, Samsun, Antalya and Bursa. This study includes examples of concept maps which Science and Technology teachers prepared during the seminars. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study aims to investigate the effects of using mind maps and concept maps on students' learning of concepts in science courses. A total of 51 students participated in this study which used a quasi-experimental research design with pre-test/post-test control groups. The constructivist-inspired study was carried out in the sixth-grade science course unit of ‘Light and Sound’ in a primary school with two experimental groups and one control group. The intervention was held in the experimental group 1 by using technology-assisted technique of mind mapping, in the experimental group 2 by using technology-assisted technique of concept mapping, and in the control group by means of traditional classroom instruction. After the intervention in the experimental groups, concept tests and open-ended questions related to the unit were used as post-tests. According to the data obtained from concept tests, it was found out that all groups' understanding of concepts was equivalent. Significantly, students in the experimental group 2 reported positive opinions, stating that learning through concept maps was useful and engaging. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The study aimed to analyze effect of concept mapping, a constructivism based learning strategy, on academic performance of 7th grade students in the subject of general science. This quasi experimental research, based on 2x2 factorial research design, involved 167 students from two single sex schools. Major objectives of the study were to; (i) find out the effect of concept mapping as a learning strategy on the academic achievement of students (ii) study differential effect of concept mapping on academic achievement of male and female students (iii) to find out the interaction effect of concept mapping as a learning strategy and gender on students' academic achievement. Researcher's developed achievement test was used as pre test and post test. During the treatment of five months, experimental group was trained to develop concept maps for three weeks. Subsequently students developed concept maps of general science content individually, shared those in groups and were compared by teacher with scientifically accepted concept maps for possible correction and improvement. Data on gain achievement scores were analyzed through 2-way ANOVA. Results showed that the male and female students taught through concept mapping performed better than the students taught through traditional teaching method. However male students taught through concept mapping performed significantly better than the female students. It is therefore recommended that concept mapping should be used in elementary classes for teaching general science. Concepts maps may also be incorporated in the textbooks of science subjects at the school level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The co-evolution model of collaborative knowledge building by Cress and Kimmerle (2008) assumes that cognitive and social processes interact when users build knowledge with shared digital artifacts. While these assumptions have been tested in various lab experiments, a test under natural field conditions in educational settings has not been conducted. Here, we present a field experiment where we triggered knowledge co-evolution in an accommodation and an assimilation condition, and measured effects on student knowledge building outside the laboratory in the context of two university courses. Therefore, 48 students received different kinds of prompts that triggered external accommodation and assimilation while writing a wiki text. Knowledge building was measured with a content analysis of the students' texts and comments (externalization), and with concept maps and association tests (internalization). The findings reveal that (a) different modes of externalization (accommodation and assimilation) could be triggered with prompts, (b) across both conditions, this externalization co-occurred with internalization (student learning), and (c) there is some evidence that external assimilation and accommodation had differential effects on internal assimilation and accommodation. Thus, the field experiment supports the assumptions of the co-evolution model in a realistic course setting. On a more general note, the study provides an example of how wikis can be used successfully for collaborative knowledge building within educational contexts. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Many recent studies have reported the benefits of educational computer games in promoting students' learning motivations. On the other hand, however, the effect of digital game-based learning in improving students' learning performance has been questioned. Several previous studies have reported that without properly integrating learning strategies into gaming scenarios, the effectiveness of educational computer games could be limited, or may be even worse than that of the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In this study, a concept map-embedded gaming approach is proposed for developing educational computer games by integrating concept mapping as part of the gaming scenarios to help students organize what they have learned during the game-based learning process. Moreover, a role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school natural science course based on the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the concept map-embedded gaming approach can significantly improve the students' learning achievement and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach revealed a significantly higher degree of perceived usefulness than those who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach.

AB  - Residential environmental education centers are important providers of science curriculum, offering students learning experiences outside the traditional classroom. One major criticism of these centers and other nonformal science centers is that they often do not include student outcomes in the evaluation of their programs. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the use of concept maps as a means of documenting changes in student knowledge in order to include students in the program evaluations of residential environmental education centers. In this mixed-method study, 3rd and 6th grade elementary students created concept maps before and after a field trip to a residential environmental education center. Analyses of the maps revealed a significant increase in the number of unique ideas represented on the posttest maps. Interviews with stakeholders revealed that the maps provided center stakeholders with valuable information regarding program impact. Results of the study suggest that concept maps can be used effectively to document changes in student knowledge and may contribute to improvement in program evaluations of residential environmental education centers.

AB  - The paper details an exploratory qualitative study that investigated 61 prospective teachers’ conceptual understanding of dissolving salt and sugar in water respectively. The study was set within a 15-week elementary science methods course that included a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the instructional context. Oversby’s (Prim Sci Rev 63:6–19, 2002 , Aspects of teaching secondary science, Routledge Falmer, London, 2002 ) ladder of explanations for the context of dissolving, current scientific explanations for dissolving and perspectives on conceptions and misconceptions provided the unified framework for the study. Concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, and drawings and narratives were used as data to investigate these prospective teachers’ conceptual understanding of dissolving throughout the 15-weeks of the methods course. Analysis revealed that participants’ explanations of dissolving were predominantly descriptive explanations (39 %) and interpretative explanations (38 %), with lower percentage occurrences of intentional (14 %) and cause and effect (9 %) level explanations. Most of these explanations were also constructed by a set of loosely connected and reinforcing everyday concepts abstracted from common everyday experiences making them misconceptions. Implications include: (1) the need for science teacher educators to use multiple platforms to derive their prospective elementary teachers’ conceptual understandings of science content; and (2) to identify and help them identify their own scientific conceptions and misconceptions and how they influence the construction of scientific/nonscientific explanations. Science teacher educators also need to emphasize the role of meaningful frameworks associated with the concept that is being introduced during the Engage phase of the 5E learning cycle. This is important because, relevant prior knowledge is associated with the knowledge of the particle theory of matter and both are part of larger knowledge system comprised of interrelated scientific concepts.

AB  - TWENTY-TWO COLLEGE STUDENTS who were deaf viewed one instructional video with standard captions and a second with expanded captions, in which key terms were expanded in the form of vocabulary definitions, labeled illustrations, or concept maps. The students performed better on a posttest after viewing either type of caption than on a pretest; however, there was no difference in comprehension between standard and expanded captions. Camtasia recording software enabled examination of the extent to which the students accessed the expanded captions. The students accessed less than 20% of the available expanded captions. Thus, one explanation for the lack of difference in comprehension between the standard and expanded captions is that the students did not access the expanded captions sufficiently. Despite limited use of the expanded captions, the students stated, when interviewed, that they considered these captions beneficial in learning from the instructional video. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: This study was undertaken with the goal of developing a Concept Map Knowledge Management System (CMKMS) for use as a tool in observing change in a student's understanding of biology concepts over time. The CMKMS should be useful in assessing the extent of a student's knowledge and in revealing their unique thought processes. The study was concerned not only with a student's self-evaluation of learning but also with their level of satisfaction after using the CMKMS. The CMKMS combines the diagnosis of concept mapping with the style of thought processing, and promotes teaching activities step-by-step, in order to promote effective student learning. In analyzing the factors that influence the effect of teaching, the teacher can determine a student's knowledge structure and highlight misconceptions by inspecting the concept maps and logs. The results of this study show that knowledge management involved in computer-aided instruction in the teaching of biology had a positive influence on learning effectiveness. The CMKMS also was useful in promoting the student's thought processing, creativity, and ability to judge. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - In the present situation, only qualified people can overcome the problems of education system. Today all coutries aims to reach modernized education system. Above all, chemistry education is one of the pioneers of our educational system. Therefore, chemistry concepts must be conveyed to the receiver (student) accurately and well-arranged. For the successful learning, teaching strategies, methods, techniques and tools should transform knowledge from short-term memory to long-term memory. Ausubels' theory of meaningful learning is one of the most important expository theories which explain how to transform information from short-term memory to long-term memory. According to this theory Meaningful learning occurs when complex ideas and information are combined with students' own experiences and prior knowledge to form personal and unique understandings. In this process, it can be said that concept maps are one of the most important teaching and learning tool that promote meaningful learning. This study was designed as the study of the compilation. The purpose of the study is to introduce concept maps as a tool for meaningful learning, student centered, active, new learning and teaching strategy in chemistry education. According to the University of Illinois, there are seven kinds of concept map. The most commonly used five kinds of concept maps in chemistry were mentioned in this study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to investigate the efficacy of using concept mapping to improve seventh-grade students' comprehension of science text. The sample involved 28 seventhgrade students during a three-week period in which the treatment group used concept mapping as a warm-up science activity. Results of the ANCOVA analysis of covariance showed no significant difference between both groups' scores in a textbook vocabulary test. Implications of the study included questions about the textbook assessment, the extent of the treatment period and the instructor's limited amount of experience with concept mapping.

AB  - Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to examine students' understanding, gained through classroom communication, of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school student teachers ( n = 20). This includes analysis of the communication styles used and the students' pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The essays and drawings concerned the students' unprompted pre- and post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry, biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the students' responses. The communication used in the four sessions was analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map showed that students' thinking had become more coherent after the four sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students' conceptions are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use a comparative approach to scrutinize the common assumption that certain school science activities are theoretical and therefore particularly suited for engaging students with scientific ideas, whereas others are practical and, thus, not equally conducive to engagement with scientific ideas. We compared two school science activities, one (laboratory work) that is commonly regarded as focusing attention on artefacts that may distract students from central science concepts and the other (concept mapping) that is thought to make students focus directly on these concepts. We observed students in either a laboratory activity about real galvanic cells or a concept-mapping activity about idealized galvanic cells. We used a practical epistemology analysis to compare the two activities regarding students' actions towards scientific ideas and artefacts. The comparison revealed that the two activities, despite their alleged differences along the theory–practice scale, primarily resulted in similar student actions. For instance, in both activities, students interacted extensively with artefacts and, to a lesser extent, with scientific ideas. However, only occasionally did students establish any explicit continuity between artefacts and scientific ideas. The findings indicate that some of the problems commonly considered to be unique for school science practical work may indeed be a feature of school science activities more generally.

AB  - Background: Medical student education is challenging, and concept maps (CMs) can help students link new and existing knowledge, promote critical thinking and identify knowledge gaps. Aims: To study the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of CMs in problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials. Method: Students and tutors were randomized to tutorials that used or did not use CMs. A mixed-methods approach generated qualitative and quantitative results of participants' perspectives on and the effects of CMs in PBL tutorials. Results: Student survey response rate was 71% (122/172). Most students (82.6%) planned to use CMs in the future at least occasionally, and students in CM tutorials endorsed increased likelihood of using CMs in the future ( p = 0.02) versus students in non-CM tutorials. Qualitative analyses identified consistent associations between CMs and recurrent themes: integration of physiological mechanisms, challenging students' knowledge of the material, and identification of knowledge gaps. Quantitative assessment of final exam scores revealed a statistically significant increase in the students' scores in CM tutorials versus students in non-CM tutorials with an a priori α of <0.10. Conclusions: CMs are well accepted by students and faculty, feasible to incorporate into PBL tutorials, and may result in improved exam performance and student learning of physiologic concepts.

AB  - <?Pub Dtl?>This paper proposes a scaffolded concept mapping strategy, which considers a student's (high or low) prior knowledge, and provides flexible learning aids (scaffolding and fading) for reading and drawing a concept map. The goal is that the whole class should progress in synchronized fashion through this strategy, with each student achieving meaningful learning. The scaffolding is tailored to the student's needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated software, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy. The paper also investigates whether this strategy improved student learning for 54 undergraduates in a database management system course. The results indicate that the students who used the strategy had better learning achievements than those who only experienced traditional lectures. Moreover, the implementation of the strategy received positive student feedback. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research in contemporary biology has become increasingly complex and organized around understanding biological processes in the context of systems. To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised 'Gene-to-Evolution' (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students' ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

AB  - This study sought to identify ethnically diverse students' study strategies in organic chemistry and their relationships to course outcomes. Study diaries, concept maps, and problem sets were used to assess study outcomes. Findings show that students engage in four commonly used reviewing-type strategies, regardless of ethnic group affiliation. However, these common strategies were rarely associated with students' problem solving, concept mapping, or course performance. In addition, students seldom engaged in metacognitive and peer learning strategies despite their reported benefits in the literature. Implications for research and practice are discussed in light of these findings. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Printed books have long been an important means for people to obtain knowledge; nevertheless, educators have pointed out problems of learning from some printed books, in particular, the lack of learning supports, such as supplementary materials and learning guiding tools. In this study, a concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is proposed for supporting printed science book reading activities for children via mobile devices with QR-code facilities. A quasi-experiment has been conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 92 sixth graders participated. The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is significantly more helpful to the students in reading printed books than traditional book reading and the conventional ubiquitous learning approach in terms of learning achievements; moreover, the students had a high level of acceptance of such a mobile technology-assisted learning system in terms of "ease of use", "usefulness" and "attitude and intention of future use."

AB  - Concept maps have become a widely used educational tool around the globe. The advancements in computerized interface technologies have enabled even more alternatives for using concept maps in teaching and learning. This study investigates the effects of two different touch technology-based concept mapping interaction modes on students' learning achievements and learning attitudes in a natural science course, as well as their degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn. Ninety two sixth graders were randomly divided into three groups. Experimental Group One was taught using the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB)-based concept mapping approach, Experimental Group Two learned with the touchscreen-based concept mapping approach, while the control group learned with the traditional paper-and-pencil-based concept mapping approach. The experimental results show that, in terms of learning attitudes toward the natural science course and the degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn, the students were significantly more positive about the two touch technology-based interaction modes than they were about the traditional paper-and-pencil mode.

AB  - We study the misconceptions about colour that most people hold, determining the general phenomenological laws that govern them. Concept mapping was used to combat the misconceptions which were found in the application of a test specifically designed to determine these misconceptions, while avoiding the possible misleading inductions that could have arisen from the use of everyday language. In particular, care was taken to avoid the distorting effect that the use of the verb ‘to be’ applied to coloured objects could have on the responses. The misconceptions found were shown to have an internal consistency in the form of authentic mini-theories (implicit theories). We compared experimentally the results of two different teaching methods applied to combat these misconceptions. This study was conducted with 470 undergraduates of the University of Extremadura. We analysed the persistence over time of their learning made to overcome those misconceptions. The students were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). To combat their misconceptions, EG were taught following a method based on the use of concept maps, and CG were taught following traditional teaching methods. The results of a pre-test and a post-test were compared for the two groups, finding statistically significant differences. The results allowed the principal working hypothesis to be accepted—concept maps are learning tools which foster conceptual change and allow misconceptions to be eradicated via meaningful learning maintained over time, i.e. EG acquired a relative long-lasting gain in learning that was superior to that acquired by CG.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers' convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students' vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers' use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool.

Concept mapping was first developed in the 1970s as an analytical tool to represent student learning in the sciences. It allows students to brainstorm the connections between ideas, institutions and other entities. The author learned that concept mapping also offers an advantage in students with limited understanding of the English language.

AB  - Background:  Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is an interactive, case-based conference for medical students designed to: (1) integrate preclinical and clinical learning; (2) promote inductive clinical reasoning; and (3) emphasise students as peer teachers. CPGR specifically encourages mixed learning level student interactions and emphasises the use of concept mapping. We describe the theoretical basis and logistical considerations for an interactive, integrative, mixed-learner environment such as CPGR. In addition, we report qualitative data regarding students' attitudes towards and perceptions of CPGR. Context:  Medical students from first to fourth year participate in a monthly, interactive conference. Programme description:  The CPGR was designed to bridge gaps and reinforce linkages between basic science and clinical concepts, and to incorporate interactive vertical integration between preclinical and clinical students. Medical education and content experts use Socratic, interactive teaching methods to develop real-time concept maps to emphasise the presence and importance of linkages across curricula. Programme evaluation:  Student focus groups were held to assess attitudes towards and perceptions of the mixed-learner environment and concept maps in CPGR. Qualitative analyses of focus group transcripts were performed to develop themes and codes describing the students' impressions of CPGR. Discussion:  CPGR is a case-based, interactive conference designed to help students gain an increased appreciation of linkages between basic science and clinical medicine concepts, and an increased awareness of clinical reasoning thought processes. Success is dependent upon explicit attention being given to goals for students' integrated learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We believe that Ausubel's cognitive learning theory provides a strong basis for improving teaching and learning. This work presents the combination of constructivist epistemology, Internet use and CmapTools, a software toolkit for building conceptual maps to deepen the concepts of "gas laws ". Conceptual maps are a powerful tool not only for perception, representation and archiving of knowledge, but also to create new knowledge. It is essential to helping students understand that all concepts are somehow related to each other and to select cross-links as specific as possible and identify the most appropriate linking words to connect concepts, http://cmapspublic.ihmc.us/rid=lL77HZZH0-JJS3VW-lS6Q/0.Harta%20conceptual%C4%8. Students who are involved in the construction of conceptual maps of physics are engaged in a creative process, and this can be challenging, especially for students who have spent most of their lives in learning by heart. The CmapTools Software Toolkit brings together the strengths of concept mapping with the power of technology, the Internet and World Wide Web. The software not only makes it easy for users to build and modify concept maps, but allows users to build their remote collaboration and publication, so that anyone can access with links to resources, to explain their content and other information for created conceptual map. CmapTools software tool can serve as a basis for a new kind of integration of Internet resources and all classroom experiences, physical laboratory, and outside them. If it is used in conjunction with conceptual maps designed to support learning, it provides a new educational model. In this present work we used activities that allow students to construct their own structure of conceptual map using a list of concepts also mapping activities that are required students to complete the gaps in the structure of incomplete maps to assess the connections they make between important concepts. Workspace is public. It can be seen at the IHMC Public Cmaps CmapServer under "Claudia Cziprok/Legile gaze lor" folder (http://cmapspublic.ihmc.us/rid=lL81NZX99-llRWVlJ-lSB4/3.Legile%20gazelor).

AB  - Problem Statement: Students spend a considerable amount of their time studying from textbooks, which play an important role in their learning activities. The strategies students use to learn work as guides, requiring them to mentally process, make sense of and internalize information offered to them during the instructional process. Of these, elaboration and organization strategies enable students to establish internal and external links among different pieces of information. Knowing the elaboration and organization strategies used by prospective class teachers when teaching from social studies education textbooks would benefit curriculum designers as well as all education stakeholders. Purpose of the Study: The purpose of this study is to describe how prospective class teachers use elaboration and organization strategies as they study their social studies education textbook. Methods: Data was collected through analysing 235 social studies education textbooks used by prospective class teachers. As the data source was a textbook, document and content analysis techniques were employed. Findings and Results: The prospective class teachers in this study used the following elaboration strategies while studying the social studies education textbook: 90.3% took notes, 81.7% summarized information in their own words, 45.5% used grouping, and 3% formed questions. A moderate relationship existed between the categories of note-taking and summarizing. As for organization strategies, 43.8% created outlines, 33.2% made matrices, charts and tables, 21.2% used concept maps, and 9.8% used information mapping. No prospective class teacher seemed to be using hierarchical structures. Outlining and concept-mapping were found to be moderately related to making matrices, charts and tables. Conclusions and Recommendations: Prospective class teachers in this study most commonly used the elaboration strategy of note-taking and least commonly used question forming. As for organization strategies, outlining was the most common and information mapping, the least. No prospective class teacher used hierarchical structures. These results suggest that prospective class teachers make little use of elaboration and organization strategies when studying from their social studies education textbooks, and may need learning strategy training. The results also suggest that the elaboration and organization strategies that prospective class teachers rarely or never use should be modeled in social studies education textbooks.

AB  - Good conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what the key concepts are and how they are related. This kind of understanding is especially important for physics teachers in planning how and in what order to introduce concepts in teaching; connections which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress-there is 'flux of information' so that what was learned before provides the basis for learning new ideas. In this study, we discuss how such ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how they can be used in analysing the students' views and ideas about the inherent logic of the teaching plans. The approach discussed here is informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge organisation concentrating on simple knowledge organisation patterns and how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The analysis of such concept networks is then very naturally based on the use of network theory on analysing the concept maps. The results show that even in well-connected maps, there can be abrupt changes in the information flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a pre-service teacher to master. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The greenhouse effect is a reasonably complex scientific phenomenon which can be used as a model to examine students' conceptual understanding in science. Primary student-teachers' understanding of global environmental problems, such as climate change and ozone depletion, indicates that they have many misconceptions. The present mixed method study examines Finnish primary student-teachers' understanding of the greenhouse effect based on the results obtained via open-ended and closed-form questionnaires. The open-ended questionnaire considers primary student-teachers' spontaneous ideas about the greenhouse effect depicted by concept maps. The present study also uses statistical analysis to reveal respondents' conceptualization of the greenhouse effect. The concept maps and statistical analysis reveal that the primary student-teachers' factual knowledge and their conceptual understanding of the greenhouse effect are incomplete and even misleading. In the light of the results of the present study, proposals for modifying the instruction of climate change in science, especially in geography, are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E.G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C.G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E.G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C.G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E.G. students as compared with the C.G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E.G. students' learning was greater than 19 percentage points. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background:This study combines work on concept mapping with scripted collaborative learning. Purpose:The objective was to examine the effects of self-regulated science learning through scripting students’ argumentative interactions during collaborative ‘multimedia-enriched skeleton concept mapping’ on meaningful science learning and retention. Programme description:Each concept in the enriched skeleton concept map (ESCoM) contained annotated multimedia-rich content (pictures, text, animations or video clips) that elaborated the concept, and an embedded collaboration script to guide students’ interactions. Sample:The study was performed in a Biomolecules course on the Bachelor of Applied Science program in the Netherlands. All first-year students (N=93, 31 women, 62 men, aged 17–33 years) took part in this study. Design and methods:The design used a control group who received the regular course and an experimental group working together in dyads on an ESCoM under the guidance of collaboration scripts. In order to investigate meaningful understanding and retention, a retention test was administered a month after the final exam. Results:Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant experimental effect on the Biomolecules exam scores between the experimental group and the control, and the difference between the groups on the retention test also reached statistical significance. Conclusions:Scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping resulted in meaningful understanding and retention of the conceptual structure of the domain, the concepts, and their relations. Not only was scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping more effective than the traditional teaching approach, it was also more efficient in requiring far less teacher guidance.

For this purpose, a model of a pedagogical experiment with parallel groups of students was applied. One group was presented the course content through programmed instruction, with the help of computers and programmed materials, which included the elaboration of concept maps. The second group was presented the same content through expository (informative-illustrative) instruction, the traditional lecturing model. In terms of quantity and quality of knowledge acquired by students in the tested teaching field, the experimental model of programmed instruction was more effective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study to investigate, how third year mechanical engineering students are able to use their knowledge of concept maps in their study of the topic of 'Introduction to the Internal Combustion Engines (IICE)'. 41students participated in this study. Firstly, the students were taught about concept maps and then asked to draw their concept map of the topic IICE. Afterwards, two achievement tests were administered. One test, namely, knowledge applications test (KAT) included questions on the application of knowledge of the topic of IICE and other test, knowledge recall test (KRT) contained the questions that require a recall of knowledge of the topic of IICE. The students' concept maps were scored by comparing with the expert map created by the teacher. The correlation between concept map scores (CMS) and the scores in tests which measure application of knowledge (KAT) was moderate while the correlations between score of concept map and the test that measures a recall of knowledge ( KRT) was weak. While achievement tests measure knowledge in different context, CMS, on the other hand, measures knowledge about related concepts and relationships among concepts. As a result, concept maps can be used as a supplementary assessment method along with achievement tests. Most of the students were satisfied with use of concept mapping in the topic of internal combustion engine. They indicated that concept mapping helps them to understand the key concepts, to connect the various concepts with each other and to correct misconceptions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In physics teacher education, one of the recurrent themes is the importance of fostering the formation of organised and coherent knowledge structures, but a simple shared understanding of what coherence actually means and how it can be recognised, is not easily found. This study suggests an approach in which the coherence of students' views about the relatedness of physics concepts can be identified and evaluated. Six pre-service physics teachers presented their understanding of the relatedness of physics concepts in the form of specially designed concept maps in which experimental or modelling procedures were required as links between physics concepts. The acceptability of the links was evaluated by using four criteria for epistemic analysis introduced in this study. The weighted values describing the maps' structural features were calculated, and finally, the cases were compared and the differences between them were discussed. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge and thus also the coherence of such knowledge. The highest criterion set for acceptability seems to be very demanding to fulfil and even in the advanced level of studies only a fraction of students manage to reach it. The cases examined here show that the knowledge structures are partly fragmented and not as coherent as one would have expected them to be. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper proposes a series of design guidelines for implementation into digital game concepts for second and third-age adults based upon results collected from an empirical study. A mixed methods approach was undertaken comprised of game design workshops (Group 1) and observations of participants during game play on the Nintendo Wii™ and Sony PlayStation 2 consoles (Group 2). A mapping process encompassing previous literature keywords, and observations was performed, categorizing three main areas (older adults, technology, and interaction/content). This paper highlights several facets aimed towards the incorporation of design recommendations and rationales for digital game design. To produce games that appeal to a wider or ageing audience, consideration to content variety, choice, and flexibility is important—as is the ease of interaction. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of the research reported here is to improve comprehension of the socially-negotiated identity of concepts in the domain of knowledge organization. Because knowledge organization as a domain has as its focus the order of concepts, both from a theoretical perspective and from an applied perspective, it is important to understand how the domain itself understands the meaning of a concept. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an empirical demonstration of how the domain itself understands the meaning of a concept. The paper employs content analysis to demonstrate the ways in which concepts are portrayed in KO concept maps as signs, and they are subjected to evaluative semiotic analysis as a way to understand their meaning. The frame was the entire population of formal proceedings in knowledge organization – all proceedings of the International Society for Knowledge Organization's international conferences (1990-2010) and those of the annual classification workshops of the Special Interest Group for Classification Research of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (SIG/CR). Findings – A total of 344 concept maps were analyzed. There was no discernible chronological pattern. Most concept maps were created by authors who were professors from the USA, Germany, France, or Canada. Roughly half were judged to contain semiotic content. Peirceian semiotics predominated, and tended to convey greater granularity and complexity in conceptual terminology. Nodes could be identified as anchors of conceptual clusters in the domain; the arcs were identifiable as verbal relationship indicators. Saussurian concept maps were more applied than theoretical; Peirceian concept maps had more theoretical content. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates important empirical evidence about the coherence of the domain of knowledge organization. Core values are conveyed across time through the concept maps in this population of conference papers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigates undergraduate students' experiences working with a mentor to understand research through the process of publishing scholarly manuscripts. The study is based on a 10-week educational program. Two undergraduate students were integrated into an educational mentoring process to identify and evaluate the research of various scientific manuscripts, such as literature reviews, research questions, hypotheses, and methods. The undergraduate students were exposed to the processes behind the review, research and production of manuscripts. They also worked with their mentors to review a manuscript, an activity that engaged them in the process of editorial work through the manuscript management system. The students then drew concept maps of the publishing process, pre- and post-session. These maps presented evidence of students' knowledge of the complex interactions of the players and issues in the publishing process. The students evaluated the mentoring process and demonstrated their satisfaction with the strength of the program. As a qualitative study and as a result of the study program, a blueprint of an undergraduate course in scholarly publishing was developed, and is presented in the paper. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Web-based hypermedia learning environments are widely used in modern education and seem particularly well suited for interdisciplinary learning. Previous work has identified guidance through these complex environments as a crucial problem of their acceptance and efficiency. We reasoned that map-based navigation might provide straightforward and effortless orientation. To achieve this, we developed a clickable and user-oriented concept map-based navigation plugin. This tool is implemented as an extension of Moodle, a widely used learning management system. It visualizes inner and interdisciplinary relations between learning objects and is generated dynamically depending on user set parameters and interactions. This plugin leaves the choice of navigation type to the user and supports direct guidance. Previously developed and evaluated face-to-face interdisciplinary learning materials bridging physiology and physics courses of a medical curriculum were integrated as learning objects, the relations of which were defined by metadata. Learning objects included text pages, self-assessments, videos, animations, and simulations. In a field study, we analyzed the effects of this learning environment on physiology and physics knowledge as well as the transfer ability of third-term medical students. Data were generated from pre- and posttest questionnaires and from tracking student navigation. Use of the hypermedia environment resulted in a significant increase of knowledge and transfer capability. Furthermore, the efficiency of learning was enhanced. We conclude that hypermedia environments based on Moodle and enriched by concept map-based navigation tools can significantly support interdisciplinary learning. Implementation of adaptivity may further strengthen this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This paper continues the discussion that Beier and colleagues start in the paper by calling into question both the idea that a predictive model of science career choice can be attained by serious science game-playing and the nature of the instrument created and used by Beier and her colleagues to identify participants' creation of science possible selves. Recommendations include incorporating the idea of possible selves as being complex, dynamic and intertwined with self-concept in interpreting their findings and casting a wider net to capture the phenomena of their participants' identities and experiences by potentially making use of possible selves identification methodologies from the career training arena.

AB  - The static curriculum and its sequential structure is often debated in the context of its authentic implementation. Thus, practitioners often hold it as the only way of steering the teaching and learning process, without much question. This has raised doubts as to why students still face problems of linking basic concepts even though the concepts were introduced in the early years of schooling. Thus, the aim of this study is to explore alternative strategies in the curriculum development and the curriculum implementation to shed light on sustaining the understanding and the linking of concepts in the curriculum at the primary and secondary level. In this article, the researcher has developed technology-enriched puzzles in the form of "images" which are stored in folders and the teachers have to build the curriculum developed and available in the primary school and in the secondary school. This might seem as a "building block" task but in actual fact there are identified links that need to be matched between the simple concepts, complex concepts, multiple concepts, simple branched concepts and branched complex concepts. When the primary school curriculum and the secondary school curriculum is envisioned as two separate entities, the concepts in the mind of the students too are disjointed or does not seem to have a link whatsover. This similar situation experienced by teachers when the teacher trained only for teaching secondary school syllabus is not exposed to the primary school syllabus. Thus, links and connections are hardly made when a particular level teacher is ignorant of the other interrelated levels/interdependent levels. Based on this rationale, the researcher embarked on this technology--enriched puzzles which were randomised to ascertain whether the teachers are able to connect the basic missing links provided. The implicit brainstorming activity to provide the big picture for the teachers is to identify specific details and scrutinise concepts that are tightly linked, tightly and closely linked, loosely linked, distantly and tightly linked, distantly and loosely linked is to inculcate high-order thinking skills. Though, this provides a platform for teachers to rationalise the curriculum at the primary level and at the secondary level, the brainstorming activity provided for in this research is not just to collect data about curriculum mapping and identifying the missing links but also to identify and extrapolate the other missing links and to connect the links between the primary and secondary links that are not available. This is a tool that is significant for a training programme as it "trouble shoots" the deficiencies in the teachers' content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and technological knowledge. At the same time, it has a multiple purpose of ascertaining the teachers' pedagogical content knowledge, technological content knowledge, technological pedagogical content knowledge. From the findings, a "follow-up" training programme can be devised to ascertain the deficiencies, pitfalls and enhancing the teachers' perspective of teaching from a mere "compartmentalised" conceptual dissemination of pre-determined curricular requirements to the holistic understanding of the continuity of the curricular development and its complementary implementation. What is expected from the teachers during the training programme is not just to ascertain and match the missing links but the construction of links that is deemed necessary at the different levels to ensure that the teachers' grounded understanding of conceptual foundations. Thus, this is an entirely new training programme which operates on a "self-determined learning" endeavour to determine the maximum possible linkages that can be made for steering the teaching of science. The learning of science can be made significant if only the current curriculum layout is viewed in a holistic critical manner by the teachers rather than to view it as "bits and pieces". The use of techology would expedite the process of ensuring that the teachers would be able to see the relevance of the interdependence/interrelationships of the concepts disseminated at the primary level and the secondary level.The learners would now not only operate on the paradigm of constructivism but also constructionism. This is the extension of the existing knowledge which can be of significance and meaningful to the teachers. This research was carried out adopting an action research model where teachers who were pursuing studies in curriculum were given the curricular resources and they just accepted it without much debate. Although there were other links that were deliberately omitted to ascertain whether the teachers themselves were "high-order thinkers" of conceptual linkages.One needs to take note that actual classroom teaching becomes emulated when the teachers "indulge in the research process", too. The researcher rationalised the use of technological-enriched puzzles rather than a mundane quantitative data collection using paper and pencil or interviews as this is a realistic and authentic "hands-on approach" to observe and trace the thinking process of "concept mapping" and "concept linking" when the teachers are involved in the process of ascertaining links and creating links that were not evident on the curriculum documents. The study cannot be generalisable as the data collected was of from a particular cohort of teachers pursuing the postgraduate programme in a university in the central region of Malaysia. The findings revealed that the science teachers at the primary level were unable to determine the direction of the complex concept linkages at the secondary school science level. The secondary school science teachers made concept linkages with that which was closely related to concepts disseminated in the highest level of the primary school science. However, the missing element that was evident is that the secondary school teachers did not "back track" the complex concepts to the initiation of the concept development at the lower primary levels. This meaningful data collected is significant for strategising the planning of training science teachers in the future. The implications of the study revealed that science teaching and learning should not operate on a mere "acceptance" and "conformist" approach but rather the "constructionism" thinking element of the teacher. The customised technological-enriched puzzles for authentic curriculum development and implementation is to ensure the sustainability of meaningful science teaching and its "construction" learning with its applicability to the current situation and demands.

AB  - Research has identified the value of students constructing their own representations of science concepts using modes such as writing, diagrams, 2-D and 3-D models, images or speech to communicate meaning. 'Slowmation' (abbreviated from 'Slow Animation') is a simplified way for students, such as preservice teachers, to make a narrated animation using a combination of modes. In this study, 13 preservice primary teachers learned how to create a slowmation during a two-hour class in a science methods course and then created one about an allocated science topic as an assignment. The research question that guided this study was, 'What are the preservice teachers' perceptions of making a slowmation and how was the science concept represented in the animation?' Data included pre and post individual interviews, concept maps constructed during the interviews and the animations as artifacts. Three case studies provide a window into the perceptions of preservice teachers making a slowmation and show how they represented their concept. Slowmation is a new form of student-generated representation which enables them to use their own technology to construct a narrated animation as a multimodal representation to explain a science concept.

AB  - Abstract: Prior research has shown that people are likely to skim information presented digitally with the resultant deleterious effect on accurate mental models of the text. Teaching monitoring strategies and presenting text with adjunct questions are effective strategies for improving the mental models of readers of scientific text, but the two strategies have not been directly compared for studying text read from a computer screen. In the present study, participants were individually tested in two experiments in which they studied computer-based text on the heart and circulatory system while either reading the text with no interruption, answering adjunct inference questions, answering adjunct factual questions, or answering prompts for global or specific monitoring. Reading time was untimed but looking back was not available. Prompting for global monitoring was most effective for improvement of mental models as measured by scores in diagram drawing, concept map construction, factual memory, and generating inferences. Further, global monitoring did not require more time-on-task than the other methods. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Groups of children at a science museum were pre- and post-assessed with a type of concept map, known as personal meaning maps, to determine what new understandings, if any, they were gaining from participation in a series of structured hands-on activities about bones and the process of bones healing. Close examination was made regarding whether children's prior knowledge or a ceiling effect was influencing results. Children made significant gains in vocabulary and concepts related to both bones and the bone healing process. Many children also demonstrated that their comprehension moved from a novice level to a transitional level of understanding. Prior to participation, children were more uniformly unacquainted with ideas about the healing process of bones than they were about bones; this led to more consistent learning gains related to the healing process. There was some indication of a ceiling effect occurring when children revealed what they had learned about bones, but not when they revealed what they had learned about the bone healing process. Although the prior knowledge theory was not statistically supported, data did show that children with greater understanding prior to the Busy Bones Lab activities end up with correspondingly greater understanding. This suggests that addressing concepts related to bones prior to a lab experience may bring more children to a higher level of understanding before engaging in the lab experience.

AB  - Abstract: Speech recognition is an active process that involves some form of predictive coding. This statement is relatively uncontroversial. What is less clear is the source of the prediction. The dual-stream model of speech processing suggests that there are two possible sources of predictive coding in speech perception: the motor speech system and the lexical-conceptual system. Here I provide an overview of the dual-stream model of speech processing and then discuss evidence concerning the source of predictive coding during speech recognition. I conclude that, in contrast to recent theoretical trends, the dorsal sensory–motor stream is not a source of forward prediction that can facilitate speech recognition. Rather, it is forward prediction coming out of the ventral stream that serves this function. Learning outcomes: Readers will (1) be able to explain the dual route model of speech processing including the function of the dorsal and ventral streams in language processing, (2) describe how disruptions to certain components of the dorsal stream can cause conduction aphasia, (3) be able to explain the fundamental principles of state feedback control in motor behavior, and (4) identify the role of predictive coding in motor control and in perception and how predictive coding coming out of the two streams may have different functional consequences.

AB  - Inside the globalisation era in which society is immersed, one of the current challenges for any educational system is to provide quality education. While some countries are linguistically homogeneous, many countries and regions display a wealth of linguistic diversity and it is essential to adapt the educational system to those realities. In addition, multilingual education promotes not only social equality but also inter- cultural education. The development of computer software localisable not only at interface level but also regarding learning resources may help to fulfill this aim. During the last years a number of products have emerged to support computer-based concept mapping. This paper presents a pilot study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU in the area of database systems with three main aims: to facilitate learning about the subject domain, to evaluate whether concept mapping is in general a good technique for learning topics in different languages, and finally, to verify whether CM-ED Concept Map EDitor provides the necessary mechanisms to fulfil this objective. Results confirm that the use of a concept map editor is a good support for education in multilingual settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The newly created concentration in bioprocess engineering at East Carolina University was developed with a novel curriculum designed to engage the students and improve their mastery of concepts using proven pedagogical approaches. This study presents the development of nine instructional modules for three bioprocess engineering courses (three modules per course) and the assessment of the effectiveness of the instructional modules. Each module is initiated by presenting the students with a challenge question. The students work on the challenge by completing a cycle of exercises that are designed to engage critical thinking and self-assessment, and for making connections among concepts within the course. The module culminates with students presenting their 'answer' to the challenge through various means, such as a report, poster, video, exam, etc. Of the nine modules, three are integrated through the different bioprocess engineering courses. This integration provides a theme for the students to make connections among the different courses and to transfer concepts to new situations. Our work sought to provide the answers to two research questions: 1) Did the students master the facts, skills, and concepts of bioprocess engineering through the use of the modules? and 2) Did the use of the modules create an effective How People Learn (HPL) learning environment within the three bioprocess engineering courses? The results of the assessment indicate that the modules were effective in developing the students' mastery of the facts, skills, and concepts across all three courses and created a very effective HPL learning environment in two of the three courses.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to measure the effects of higher level, inquiry-based science curricula on students at primary level in Title I schools. Approximately 3,300 K-3 students from six schools were assigned to experimental or control classes ( N = 115 total) on a random basis according to class. Experimental students were exposed to concept-based science curriculum that emphasized 'deep learning' though concept mastery and investigation, whereas control classes learned science from traditional school-based curricula. Two ability measures, the Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (BBCS-R, Bracken ) and the Naglieri Nonverbal Intelligence Test (NNAT, Naglieri ), were used for baseline information. Additionally, a standardized measure of student achievement in science (the MAT-8 science subtest), a standardized measure of critical thinking, and a measure for observing teachers' classroom behaviors were used to assess learning outcomes. Results indicated that all ability groups of students benefited from the science inquiry-based approach to learning that emphasized science concepts, and that there was a positive achievement effect for low socio-economic young children who were exposed to such a curriculum.

AB  - Physiology is often considered a challenging course for students. It is up to teachers to structure courses and create learning opportunities that will increase the chance of student success. In an undergraduate exercise physiology course, concept maps are assigned to help students actively process and organize information into manageable and meaningful chunks and to teach them to recognize the patterns and regularities of physiology. Students are first introduced to concept mapping with a commonly relatable nonphysiology concept and are then assigned a series of maps that become more and more complex. Students map the acute response to a drop in blood pressure, the causes of the acute increase in stroke volume during cardio-respiratory exercise, and the factors contributing to an increase in maximal O2 consumption with cardiorespiratory endurance training. In the process, students draw the integrative nature of physiology, identify causal relationships, and learn about general models and core principles of physiology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to investigate lower secondary school students' knowledge and awareness on mangrove ecosystems, to develop an integrated learning package, and to study the effect of developed learning package on students' knowledge and awareness. The participants were thirty-two grade eight students which are randomized using purposive sampling technique. The criteria for purposive sampling are students who are study in lower secondary school level, schools are located not more than 5 kilometers from mangrove ecosystems, there is local sage on mangrove ecosystems, and the participants show their willingness to participate in this study. These participants attended the developed learning package in second semester, academic year 2010. The developed learning package composes of various activities such as games, lectures from local sage, teacher and researcher, field trips in local ecosystems, discussion with local sage, and teamwork assignments. The mixed-methods research paradigm (Johnson & Onwuegbuzie, 2004) was employed for data collection and analysis. The quantitative data include questionnaires on awareness and multiple choices items for conceptual understanding. The data were collected both before and after participation in the learning package. In addition, interviews, classroom observations, and the written documents on food chain, food web, and adaptations were collected. Quantitative data of pre-test and post-test were analyzed using the paired t-test. The questionnaires were collected, coded, and analyzed. The significance at P<0.05 was used for mean separation and comparing the students' awareness before and after participating in the learning package. The transcription from the interview on perceptions on mangrove ecosystems were categorized into four levels using the scoring rubric: poor, fair, good, and excellent. The holistic scoring rubrics technique was used to analyze the concept maps, food chains and food web, reports, and interviews. They were categorized into three levels of conceptual understanding: poor, fair, and good conceptual understanding. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of the present study was to examine how the use of V-diagrams one of the learning techniques used in laboratory studies in experiments conducted regarding the 10th grade lesson unit of 'waves' influenced students' achievements. In the study, a quasi-experimental design with a pretest and posttest control group was used. The study was carried out with 68 high school 10th grade students attending in central Diyarbakir in the spring term of the academic year of 2010-2011. An achievement test made up of 30 multiple-choice questions covering the lesson unit of waves and a concept test made up of 20 fill-in-the-blanks and true-false questions were applied as pretest and posttest. When the scores obtained from these tests were compared, it was seen that the experimental group students were significantly more successful than the control group students. Besides these tests, the 'V-diagram Student Views Questionnaire' was applied to the experimental group students to determine their views about V-diagrams. Accordingly, it was concluded that the students enjoyed doing experiments by using V-diagrams and that they considered V-diagrams as a useful technique for learning the concepts related to V-diagrams and for presenting meaningful information in an organized manner.

AB  - Most students think animals are more interesting than plants as a study topic believing that plants are inferior to animals because they are passive and unable to respond to external challenges, particularly biological invaders such as microorganisms and insect herbivores. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit, the Fighting Plant Learning Unit (FPLU), which focuses on plant defense responses to biological stimuli. The study also investigated students' perceptions of the FPLU implemented in a constructivist classroom. A total of 31 Thai science majors from grade 12 participated in this study. Multiple data-gathering techniques (quantitative and qualitative) were employed: conceptual testing, concept mapping, the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. It was found that from their active participation, the students developed a better conceptual understanding of plant defense mechanisms. In addition, they appeared to have positive attitudes toward the FPLU as evidenced by their preference for inquiry-based teaching in a constructivist learning environment. Finally, their perspectives on and appreciation of plants as active organisms had been favorably changed by the experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The PISA 2000 study found large differences between countries in terms of quality of learning. In some countries, students prefer rote learning to meaningful learning. However, such memorisation of the material does not lead to recallable and usable knowledge in the long run. Ausubel's (1968) wellknown theory serves as a basis for several techniques of meaningful learning, including concept mapping, which emphasises the visual organization of comprehended information. The present study reports the results of an experiment using concept mapping for deepening students' understanding of teaching materials. It focuses on definitions frequently used in science and Hungarian grammar lessons. Results indicate that concept mapping training programmes can improve participants' achievement. Experiences show that the technique of concept mapping is frequently unfamiliar to students. More time would be needed for practising and using it in different learning situations [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Nurses and nursing student must develop and write nursing care plan to provide and organize nursing interventions. Nursing care plans serve as a means of communicating patient care needs between members of the interdisciplinary care team. Traditional linear care plans did not met the educational and functional needs of current nursing students. In an effort to improve nursing students' clinical reasoning and recognition of interrelatedness of patient data, the traditional care plan format was changed to concept mapping. This article describes the integration of concept mapping in an Associate Degree Nursing program. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In recent years, e-learning has been used in a chemical engineering subject in the final course of a mining engineering degree, a subject concerned with fuel technology. The low results obtained by students in this subject have led the teacher to search for new strategies to increase grades. Such strategies have consisted of incorporating into the existing virtual environment a dynamics of work with conceptual maps and a consideration of the different learning styles in the classroom. In an attempt to adapt teaching to the individual methods of learning for each student, various activities aimed at strengthening different learning styles have been proposed and concept maps have been used to create meaningful learning experiences. In addition, different modalities of assessment have been proposed, which can be selected by each student according to his or her particular method of learning to avoid penalising one style preference in contrast to another. This combination of e-learning, use of concept maps and catering for different learning styles has involved the implementation of the improved virtual learning environment. This has led to an increase in participation in the subject and has improved student assessment results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science IDEAS is an evidence-based model that reflects interdisciplinary research findings that support the integration of literacy (e.g., reading comprehension) within science instruction in grades K-5. Presented is a framework for planning integrated science and literacy instruction in which six elements (handson investigations, reading, journaling/ writing, propositional concept maps, application activities, prior knowledge/ cumulative review) serve as a means of providing students with conceptually- coherent, in-depth science instruction. Reviewed is a multi-year Science IDEAS research initiative whose findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the model in engendering student science and reading achievement growth in grades K-2 and in grades 3-5 in a manner that facilitates positive transfer to grades 6-8. Based on the results presented and related research, curriculum policy changes that would increase the time allocated to science instruction in grades K-5 are suggested as a means of improving the present school reform movement.

AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill‐structured and interconnected. Concept‐mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill‐structured. Evaluations of concept‐mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade‐point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis’ Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept‐mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In an attempt to reveal potential threshold concepts in the field of higher education pedagogy, groups of university teachers (in the UK and in Panama) were encouraged to develop personal reflection upon their conceptions of teaching. This was initiated through concept mapping activities. It was hoped that this would help participants to address the perceived differences of teaching between their disciplines whilst coming to recognise the generic factors that may be applicable to teaching across the university context. Consideration of emergent personal models allowed the authors to identify common themes across the disciplines and to align this to established learning theories that may act as a baseline for comparison. The emergent generic model was a modification of Kolb’s learning cycle in which two learning cycles (one for the student and one for the teacher) are linked by the shared concrete experience of the classroom and considered in the context of knowledge structures. The transformation of the morphology of these knowledge structures (oscillating between linear and hierarchical) is seen as fundamental to the successful negotiation of the cycle. The participants’ recognition of this structural transformation is proposed as a threshold concept for the evolution of university teaching. Personal models are described here in relation to the double Kolb cycle to illustrate the potential of this approach to stimulate discussion about university teaching that may encourage a transformation in perspective from delivery and receipt of content towards structural transformation of content.

AB  - The purpose of this research is threefold: (1) to identify the difficulties that Grade 10 students in a Lebanese school have that hinder their conceptual understanding at the micro–macro–symbolic interface in chemistry, (2) to investigate the effect of a macro–micro–symbolic teaching approach on students’ relational understanding of chemical reactions, and (3) to characterize students’ conceptual profiles regarding their understanding of chemical reactions in terms of macro, micro, symbolic levels and the relations among them, at the end of the teaching sequence. Forty six 10th graders from two sections participated in the study. A student-centered approach was followed in both sections based on constructivist pedagogy. Hence the teacher played the role of a facilitator who guided students in a meaning making inductive learning process, through questioning, monitoring, validating, and clarifying ideas. Instruction in the experimental group was characterized by macro–micro–symbolic teaching that focuses on the interplay between the levels, integrates various representations, and engages students in an epistemic discourse about the nature of knowing in chemistry. Data sources for the study included a pre-test and two post-intervention tasks: a post-test and a concept map task, in addition to interviews with selected students from both sections. Findings indicated that macro–micro–symbolic teaching enhanced students’ conceptual understanding and relational learning of chemical reactions. Besides, four assertions related to students’ conceptual and epistemological thinking in response to the different teaching approaches are presented. Implications for instruction and for teacher education programs, as well as recommendations for further research, are discussed in light of these findings. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Research apprenticeships for secondary students provide authentic contexts for learning science in which students engage in scientific investigations with practicing scientists in working laboratory groups. Student experiences in these research apprenticeships vary depending on the individual nature of the laboratory in which students have been placed. This study explores potential relationships among student experiences in apprenticeship contexts and desired student outcomes (e.g. science content knowledge, understandings of nature of science, and aspirations for science oriented career plans). The following two research questions guided the study: How do participant experiences in and outcomes resulting from an authentic research program for high school students vary? How does variation in participant experiences in an authentic research program relate to participant outcomes? Primary data sources were student and mentor interviews in addition to student generated concept maps. Results indicated that the greatest variance in student experiences existed in the categories of collaboration, epistemic involvement, and understandings of the significance of research results. The greatest variation in desired student outcomes was observed in student understandings of nature of science and in students' future science plans. Results suggested that collaboration and interest in the project were experience aspects most likely to be related to desired outcomes. Implications for the design of research apprenticeships for secondary students are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The paper describes how specific descriptors for the Conservation-Restoration profession have been developed by the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organizations. The result of which is in accordance with the threefold rubric of Knowledge, Skills and Competence as defined by the European Qualifications Framework. Instead of giving a broad general description of level, which is insufficiently expressive, concept mapping has been used to explicitly uncover the topography of Knowledge, Skills and Competence required for access to the profession. The application of this method, originally developed by Novak in 1972 to enhance learning in the sciences, demonstrates that it is possible to elucidate the complex nature of such professions using such a declarative system. Its hierarchical nature and the ease with which links between different elements can be identified aid the construction of an intellectually robust framework, thereby demonstrating its appropriateness. The results suggest that access to the profession can be presented as a framework of interconnected cognitive competencies, which can be expressed as a structural process where each element possesses an individual level of skill and knowledge.

AB  - This study is a meta-synthesis of 20 action research studies undertaken in the classroom by teachers to develop their understanding of an innovative strategy for teaching science. The studies were undertaken as part of the requirements for their 2-year M.Ed. program from the Aga Khan University, Institute for Educational Development (AKU-IED), Pakistan. The teachers enrolled in the program are expected to conduct a small-scale study as part of their thesis requirement which counts for 16 credits or 25% of the program. Twenty studies from a total of 350 M.Ed. thesis were selected based on specific criteria that they (a) are qualitative action research studies, (b) are undertaken by teachers who themselves teach in the science classroom, and (c) use an innovative strategy for teaching science. The meta-synthesis shows that action research contributed to developing understanding in all three domains of teacher knowledge: pedagogical knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and pedagogical content knowledge. The teacher researchers developed an understanding of the theory and practice of the innovative strategy implemented and found that the transformation of their science content knowledge to 'fit' the new ways of teaching was the most challenging and rewarding part of their research. They also found that the balance between innovative ways of teaching science and current methods of assessment was very hard to achieve and created a barrier to the acceptance of new methods of teaching.

AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject's body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

They explain an SCT reasoning process which does not assume that examinees engage in probability calculations and Bayesian inferences. They conclude the use of 'think-aloud' or concept mapping protocols to determine examinees' use of probability- versus typicality-based reasoning strategies when answering SCT questions.

AB  - Abstract: Parental leave and early childhood education and care have gained a high profile in child and family policy fields, and both have been the subject of substantial cross-national mapping, describing and comparing their main features across a range of countries. This article provides overviews on parental leave and early childhood services in affluent countries, and reflections on this mapping. The article argues that such mapping is important and can still be taken further, to give ‘thicker’ descriptions of the policy terrain, but that more of another, related activity is required: exploration of the environment, using maps as one contextual tool to better understand what goes on within this terrain. It offers suggestions for comparative exploration of different national environments including the comparative study of pedagogical theories, values and practices. While the article takes a broadly positive, even enthusiastic, view of comparative work, it acknowledges that it has its dangers too, not least the problems that may arise from the increasing and uncritical acceptance of English as an academic lingua franca. In conclusion, the case is made for comparative research as an instrument for sustaining democracy, through its contribution to critical thought and awareness of alternatives.

AB  - Background: Concept-mapping and interview techniques are used to track knowledge and understanding over the duration of PhD study amongst four students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards their PhDs. This work is in contrast to much PhD supervision research and policy research that focuses on supervisory styles and roles and may decontextualise the topic and disciplinary setting. Purpose: The work investigates the understanding of the process and product in PhD-level research and supervision. Sample: Participants were four students and their supervisor(s). Case studies were based on longitudinal studies conducted over three to four years (the duration of a PhD). The students were all enrolled in lab-based PhDs in one UK-based higher education institution. Three of the four students were international (one EU-based) and three supervisors were from outside the UK. Design and methods: The data provide documentary evidence of the ways in which these supervisors act to facilitate learning and discovery of research processes and an understanding of lab-based science research supervision. In the initial interview (conducted separately with students and supervisors), the interviewee constructed two maps, one on the topic of the PhD and one on the process of a PhD. In subsequent interviews, the student or supervisor reviewed and updated the previously constructed maps. Transcripts of the interviews were made as well. These data draw on 72 interviews and 96 unique concept maps constructed. The challenges of a PhD being both a process of learning (for the student and the supervisor) and a product of a research project are explored using case study analysis of these four pairs. Findings and discussion: Analyses of the collected data suggested that the students focused more on the product of a PhD (completing a thesis and publication), whereas the supervisors concentrated on the process of learning and scientific development. Conclusions: Evidence in the study suggested product/process differences in the student and supervisor conceptualisation of the PhD. This paper offers development towards a research-led pedagogy of supervision that places the process and product of a PhD at the centre of the supervisory relationship. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - This paper presents the qualitative analysis of data from a 20-year project analyzing the knowledge and attitudes toward science of undergraduate students enrolled in introductory astronomy courses. The data were collected from nearly 10,000 students between 1989 and 2009 via a written survey that included four open-ended questions, inquiring into students' knowledge of scientific inquiry, DNA, computer software, and radiation. Trends in students' responses were arranged into concept maps that depict patterns in student thinking. Students' responses were also compared with criteria established by a sample of scientists. Students were familiar with empiricism in science and understood that science tries to explain the world but were not as attuned to the need to support arguments with evidence as scientists would expect. Students had a narrower conception of DNA, yet often related a blend of accurate and inaccurate ideas. The accuracy of students' descriptions of software increased over time, though they were more likely to approach software from a consumer rather than computer science perspective. Students attended overly much to the dangers of radiation, and the accuracy of responses decreased over time. This research demonstrates that students' ideas about science are less focused than scientists would like. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Summary: The complexity of the health care environment is increasing with the explosion of technology, coupled with the issues of patients'' access, equity, time efficiency, and cost containment. Nursing education must focus on means that enable students to develop the processes of active learning, problem-solving, and critical thinking, in order to enable them to deal with the complexities. This study aims at identifying the nursing students'' perceptions about the effectiveness of utilized teaching and learning strategies of clinical education, in improving students'' knowledge, skills, and attitudes. A descriptive cross sectional study design was utilized using both qualitative and quantitative approaches. Data were collected from 74 students, using a questionnaire that was developed for the purpose of the study and analyzed using descriptive and non-parametric statistics. The findings revealed that demonstration was the most effective strategy for improving students'' skills; reflection, for improving attitudes; and problem based learning and concept map for improving their knowledge. Students'' responses to open-ended questions confirmed the effectiveness of these strategies in improving their learning outcomes. Recommendations have been provided based on the findings.

AB  - Mobile and wireless communication technologies not only enable anytime and anywhere learning, but also provide the opportunity to develop learning environments that combine real-world and digital-world resources. Nevertheless, researchers have indicated that, without effective tools for helping students organize their observations in the field, the mobile learning performance could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes an interactive concept map-oriented approach for supporting mobile learning activities. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhances learning attitudes, but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

AB  - We report here a study employing the STS approach for developing a learning unit on biocontrol for secondary school students to enhance their understanding of the impact of pesticides, their knowledge of biocontrol of insect pests, and their attitude toward the environment. We focused on the analysis of the impact of pesticides and the success of insect pest biocontrol by the cooperative effort of students, school teachers, local sages, and agriculturists. The students not only learned about the insect pests and other natural enemies of plants in the rice fields, they also learned from the laboratory and local experts. Five instruments were used to assess students' achievement in terms of knowledge and attitude: pretest and posttest, concept map, questionnaire, semi-structured interview, and classroom observation. The results showed a significant enhancement in students' knowledge and understanding of pesticides, insect pests and enemies of plants, and biological control. Students also became more aware and friendly toward the environment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The processes of curricula, textbooks and student resources development have been broadly surveyed and studied while teachers' guides have received comparatively little consideration throughout recent reforms in science education. Ideal curriculum materials align instruction with the goals of reform. Well-designed teachers' guides contribute to communicating and supporting reform-based teaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions and assistance that guides provide science teachers. A questionnaire was developed and administered to science teachers from a stratified sample of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan. The findings indicated that the guides were of greater benefit to elementary school science teachers than they were to junior high teachers. These groups of teachers perceived the guides' usefulness differently, but they believed that a clear, concise presentation of the purpose, reminders, answer keys, concept maps of the main topics and learning progression provided the most helpful and preferred layout. Teachers felt that the function of a teachers' guide is to provide teaching resources rather than to guide teacher thinking. This study discusses design suggestions that can engage teacher thinking.

AB  - The ability to appreciate the inter-connectedness of complex biological relationships can be difficult for many students. Graphical knowledge in the form of concept maps and flow charts are learning tools which can assist students to recognise the inter-connectivity. This report focuses on a trial which incorporates these two related visual learning tools using a tablet PC to support their instruction in an undergraduate introductory microbiology class. The objectives of the trial were to introduce both concept maps and flow charts so as to assist students in linking theory with practical knowledge, to make connections within and outside their course of study, and to increase student preparedness and time management in laboratories. An integrated approach to teaching using a pen-based technology with live audio visual in both lectures and laboratories was used. This report details the implementation of the teaching approach focusing on the application of the concept maps and flow charts and how tablet PC technology was incorporated in both settings. The evaluation results of the trial are also reported indicating the impact of the integrated teaching approach on student learning experience and concludes with potential areas for future consideration.

AB  - Recent National Research Council reports make compelling arguments for the need to incorporate spatial abilities and use spatial technologies throughout our educational system. We conducted a pilot study to determine the pedagogical effectiveness of teaching with geographic information systems (GIS) by using a web-based GIS tool of Indiana soils. The study was conducted in an undergraduate crop production class over three semesters. We used a pre-test, treatment, post-test design in which students (η = 96) were asked a series of questions designed to test their abilities to understand and interpret spatial concepts. During the spring and fall 2009 semesters, traditional assessments with true/false and multiple choice questions were used. After the treatment was administered, the total average score of 68% for the pre-test increased to 73% for the post-test with a standard deviation of 13%. However, we concluded that these initial assessments focused on the lower levels of Bloom's Taxonomy. Thus, in the spring 2010 semester we switched to using open concept maps to target higher levels in Bloom's Taxonomy. Using a scoring scheme based on a weighted point system, scores increased from the pre-concept maps to the post-concept maps. Paired t-tests showed that the positive changes that occurred with the treatment were significant (P < 0.01). Overall, a 22% increase in scores for pre-concept map to post-concept map reflected a slight increase in instructional learning. The web-based GIS program received favorable comments from students and proved to be instrumental in providing a rich set of materials that facilitated learner-centered instruction.

AB  - Previous research on classroom uses for political cartoons identified two negative trends: creative stagnation (as teachers utilized them solely for interpretation) and age limitation (as researchers suggested they fit best with gifted and older students). Recent scholarship has addressed both trends by enabling young adolescent students to creatively express newly generated understandings through construction of original political cartoons. During such authentic assessment activities, students demonstrated high levels of criticality by using effective and efficient technologies to create original political cartoons, which then elicited constructive whole class interpretative discussions. This prior research did not detail specific methodological steps that positively influenced students' original political cartoons. This paper compares students' original political cartoons generated from two methodological approaches that differ in two small, yet consequential steps. One teacher required students to utilize concept maps and substitution lists prior to original political cartoon construction while the other did not. Based on the collected data, these two steps enabled the former teacher's students to more effectively incorporate intricate and complex encoded messages through the use of abstract symbolism and complementary textual statements. The findings prove meaningful for teachers and researchers interested in enabling students' creative and critical expressions of historical thinking. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Open ontology learning is the process of extracting a domain ontology from a knowledge source in an unsupervised way. Due to its unsupervised nature, it requires filtering mechanisms to rate the importance and correctness of the extracted knowledge. This paper presents OntoCmaps, a domain-independent and open ontology learning tool that extracts deep semantic representations from corpora. OntoCmaps generates rich conceptual representations in the form of concept maps and proposes an innovative filtering mechanism based on metrics from graph theory. Our results show that using metrics such as Betweenness, PageRank, Hits and Degree centrality outperforms the results of standard text-based metrics (TF-IDF, term frequency) for concept identification. We propose voting schemes based on these metrics that provide a good performance in relationship identification, which again provides better results (in terms of precision and F-measure) than other traditional metrics such as frequency of co-occurrences. The approach is evaluated against a gold standard and is compared to the ontology learning tool Text2Onto. The OntoCmaps generated ontology is more expressive than Text2Onto ontology especially in conceptual relationships and leads to better results in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.

AB  - The understanding of curricular design and development is paramount for faculty. For novice faculty, learning teaching methods commonly takes precedence over understanding curriculum development. Professional accrediting bodies of nursing programs require curriculum course content to be pertinent and flow logically. Baccalaureate nursing programs can choose to be accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. The purpose of this article is to describe an educational innovation that one College of Nursing implemented to orient new faculty to the curriculum and prepare for an accreditation renewal. Assigned faculty developed and implemented a concept mapping process aimed to evaluate and revise course content based on national standards and guidelines. Undergraduate faculty understanding and ownership of the curriculum was evident throughout the process. The concept mapping process proved to be an innovative approach to enhance the curriculum and equip faculty with an understanding of the relationship between concepts and course content.

AB  - The article discusses how children's gestures can help teachers in understanding what they are trying to say. Interview techniques that are combined with drawings and concept maps are the traditional way to understand how children feels or think, but non-verbal cues and clues must also be considered especially if they cannot properly express their ideas. Social gestures can also help teachers in understanding teachers just like when one seats on his hands during a class discussion.

AB  - Concept maps are metacognitive study tools created and used by learners as reference maps describing relationships between concepts and specific domains. The purpose of this study was to investigate any correlation between the quality of concept maps and the mark distributions in a first-year engineering biology course. Major concepts of the course included prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structure and composition, metabolic pathways, cell transport, genetic engineering and growth kinetics. Students were asked to develop concept maps and were allowed to consult their maps in a portion of the final exam. Maps were assigned a qualitative grouping of I (incomplete, preliminary map) or 2 (complete map) and were associated with final exam grades to compare the effectiveness of the concept maps. Students who provided complete concept maps had significantly higher 'open book' portion grades (p < 0.0001) and overall final exam grades (p < 0.0001) than students who handed in preliminary maps. The quality of the concept map was positively correlated to student performance in questions requiring conceptual skills as well as in the overall final exam grade. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Building ontology in the domain of human sciences can be a difficult process because of the different meanings given to the same key concepts in these disciplines: in fact, shared meaning is an important element in knowledge construction between members of a community. In this paper, we propose a participatory social environment called 'EduOntoWiki' where academic experts in the field of educational sciences develop lightweight ontologies that members of multiple communities of practice (teachers, trainers, etc.) can modify and integrate using a folksonomic and storytelling approach. In this way, real-life narrative contexts become precious 'tagged' alternative representations that can contribute to the ontology construction process. Experience of the environment gave possible indications regarding its use in teachers' training courses and as a useful tool to discuss evaluation and assessment issues in teachers' professional practice.

AB  - This paper describes the expressed models that children aged 7, 11, and 14 years have about micro-organisms and microbial activity. These were elicited using a variety of data collection techniques that complemented each other, resulting in a rich dataset, and provided information about the level of knowledge and progression of ideas across the age range studied. Subsequent analysis of the data enabled generalised mental models of micro-organisms to be derived that indicate a hierarchy in the sophistication and accuracy of the concepts explored. The resulting mental models were categorised as extended, transitional, and emergent and characterise the ideas held by some children in each of the age groups studied. The implications for curriculum development and consequences for learning and teaching microbiology are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

AB  - This article reports the results of a small-scale curriculum development project focusing on two of the seven 'key concepts' identified in the revised Key Stage 3 (KS3) National Curriculum programme of study for geography, introduced into schools in 2007. The study used 'interdependence' and 'physical processes' as part of a conceptual framework for creating a holistic approach to the subject, underpinned by the notion of threshold concepts. Year 9 students (aged 13-14 years) undertook classroom work investigating atmosphere, oceans, volcanoes and glaciers to develop an understanding of process, landscape, life and futures, while also considering the interdependent nature of these areas, to build an understanding of global physical systems. Use was made of student questioning and concept mapping to create 'liminal spaces' in which students could develop deeper understanding of interdependent processes and patterns. Perceptual results from student and teacher interviews suggest that a holistic curriculum was popular and also led to a greater level of critical understanding and a relational underpinning to approaching the subject.

AB  - Four physiology courses participating in a science education program used concept maps for the first time. At the conclusion of the term, students responded to an end-of-term survey about the activity. Following varied results, we sought to identify factors that students indicated are important for the acceptance of the technique. To encourage high student value of concept map exercises, instructors should consider achieving the following: (1) designing exercises to meet educational goals, (2) providing timely feedback by instructor and peers, and (3) clearly aligning exams/assessments with the concept map exercise. Following these three principles, students will not only value but will also see the connection between the concept map exercise and the course assessments. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate relations between goal orientations, information processing strategies and development of conceptual knowledge of pre-vocational secondary education students (n =719; 14 schools). Students'' preferences for certain types of goals and information processing strategies were examined using questionnaires. Conceptual knowledge was investigated by having students create concept maps before and after a learning project. Structural analyses showed that student preferences for mastery and performance goals positively affected their preferences for the use of deep and surface information processing strategies. Preferences for work avoidance goals negatively influenced preferences for deep and surface processing. Use of surface information processing strategies negatively affected the development of conceptual knowledge. Remarkably, no relation was found between students'' preferences for deep processing strategies and development of conceptual knowledge. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - A strong, recent movement in tertiary education is the development of conceptual, or ''big idea'' teaching. The emphasis in course design is now on promoting key understandings, core competencies, and an understanding of connections between different fields. In biochemistry teaching, this radical shift from the content-based tradition is being driven by the ''omics'' information explosion; we can no longer teach all the information we have available. Biochemistry is a core, enabling discipline for much of modern scientific research, and biochemistry teaching is in urgent need of a method for delivery of conceptual frameworks. In this project, we aimed to define the key concepts in biochemistry. We find that the key concepts we defined map well onto the core science concepts recommended by the Vision and Change project. We developed a new method to present biochemistry through the lenses of these concepts. This new method challenged the way we thought about biochemistry as teachers. It also stimulated the majority of the students to think more deeply about biochemistry and to make links between biochemistry and material in other courses. This method is applicable to the full spectrum of content usually taught in biochemistry. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Each day to and from school, Watsonville teens pass over one of California's largest remaining coastal freshwater wetlands—and many do not recognize this rare habitat or realize that they have an impact on it. To change their view, in 2006 the Monterey Bay Aquarium, in partnership with the Pajaro Valley Unified School District and several community groups, developed WATCH—Watsonville Area Teens Conserving Habitats. WATCH is a year-long, service-learning program that connects high school students, mostly Latino, to their local watershed, while enhancing their science knowledge, English-language learning, and leadership and job skills. The program's goal is to empower teens and to create positive change within the community. Our ongoing evaluation and improvement of WATCH has occurred primarily through surveys, concept maps and retrospective storyboards. This article describes the program, our use of age-appropriate and culturally sensitive evaluation methods, and our findings regarding the program's impact on teens' connection to nature and their community.

AB  - Active-learning techniques have been advocated as a means to promote student engagement in lower-division biology courses. In this case study, minilectures in combination with active-learning activities were evaluated as strategies to promote a culture of learning and participation in a required botany course. These activities were designed to develop critical-thinking skills, i.e. Bloom's synthesis, application, and analysis. Student attitudes toward learning, participation, and class activities were assessed with feedback surveys following each activity, at the beginning with a pre-survey and at the end of the semester with a retrospective survey. Students identified concept maps, problem-solving exercises, and the categorizing grid as helpful to their learning. Based on instructor observations, students were especially engaged in activities that allowed them to demonstrate creativity and resourcefulness. Based on the retrospective survey results, students were more conservative in their perception of personal critical-thinking skills at the end of the semester, which may be a reaction to the challenges in developing critical-thinking skills. The incorporation of mini-lectures with class activities helped to promote student engagement in the classroom and thus, was a positive instructional strategy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using visual models is common in science and should become more common in classrooms. Our research group has developed and completed studies on the use of a visual modeling tool, the Concept Connector. This modeling tool consists of an online concept mapping Java applet that has automatic scoring functions we refer to as Robograder. The Concept Connector enables students in large introductory science courses to visualize their thinking through online model building. The Concept Connector's flexible scoring system, based on tested grading schemes as well as instructor input, has enabled >1,000 physiology students to build maps of their ideas about plant and animal physiology with the guidance of automatic and immediate online scoring of homework. Criterion concept maps developed by instructors in this project contain numerous expert-generated or "correct" propositions connecting two concept words together with a linking phrase. In this study, holistic algorithms were used to test automated methods of scoring concept maps that might work as well as a human grader. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, whereas activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This case study draws attention to Pedro’s story, a Grade 6 Latino teacher who, along with other grade 4–6 teachers, participated in a three-year professional development research project. By using data analyzed from multiple ethnographic interviews with teachers and students, and by drawing from the quantitative analyzes of concept map unit tests, we illustrate how Pedro’s significant professional growth and his students’ learning were truncated by top-down school district policies. These policies were implemented because of the punitive nature of the No Child Left Behind Act. Simply put, this case study exposes the impact of opp(reg)ressive policies on learning, that is, policies simultaneously oppressive and regressive. The critical perspective of the project, and its emphasis on assisting teachers to make their pedagogy and curriculum more culturally and socially relevant, was informed by sociotransformative constructivism (sTc). This is a theoretical framework that affords equal importance to cross-cultural education (learning about and acting on socially/culturally relevant issues) and social constructivism (learning to critically produce and consume knowledge). We hope that this case study will provide additional insights into the slow progress we continue to make in science teacher professional development and in closing the achievement gap.

AB  - The study examined the effect of concept-mapping and problem-solving teaching strategies on achievement in biology among Nigerian secondary school students. The method used for the study was a quasi-experimental pre-test treatment design. One hundred and thirteen senior secondary three (S.S. Ill) students randomly selected from three mixed secondary schools located in Delta North Senatorial District of Delta State, Nigeria were used as subjects for the study. The experimental group was taught selected topics in Genetics using concept-mapping and problem — solving strategies while the control group was taught using the traditional lecture method. The result of the study showed that the experimental group performed significantly better in Genetics than the control group and that gender does not affect students achievement in biology in general.

AB  - Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves the goal of preparing students for future learning.  TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn.  Artificial intelligence enables TA to use concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback.  Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA showed “added-value” learning that did not adversely affect the “basic-value” they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time.  Furthermore, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer utilizing the software.

AB  - We undertook a self study to examine and develop our pedagogical content knowledge for teaching the nature of science. We explored two different uses of concept mapping to assess preservice teachers' ideas about the nature of science (NOS) in an elementary science methods course. The class was divided into two groups. Group 1 was provided with aspects of NOS as starter concepts for their maps, while Group 2 was asked to develop their own concepts related to "science". We found that being given the NOS aspects constrained Group 1's ability to expand the connection of the main concept with other related words. On the other hand, Group 2 had difficulty moving beyond brainstorming related concepts. Based on this, we suggest that these two methods for concept mapping can be best used for different assessment purposes and at different points in NOS instruction. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Bu çalışma bilimin doğasını öğretmek üzere kendi pedagojik alan bilgimizi incelediğimiz ve geliştirdiğimiz bir öz-inceleme (self-study)çalışmasıdır. Bu çalışmada bir ilköğretim fen öğretimi yöntemleri dersinde fen bilgisi öğretmen adaylarının bilimin doğası ile ilgili anlayışlarını değerlendirmek üzere kullanılan kavram haritalarının iki farklı kullanım şeklini keşfettik. Katılımcıları iki gruba ayırdık. 1. Gruba kavram haritalarını oluştururken bilimin doğasının yönlerini başlangıç noktası olarak almaları, 2. gruba isekendi "bilim" kavramlarını oluşturmaları söylendi. Çalışma sonunda bulgular 1. grupta yer alan katılımcılara verilen bilimin doğası yönlerinin bağlantıları kurmakta onların işini zorlaştırdığını gösterdi. Diğer yandan, 2. grup ilişkili kelimeleri bulmakta zorluk çekti. Bu bulgulara dayanarak her iki kavram haritası oluşturma yönteminin farklı değerlendirme amaçlarıyla kullanılabileceği ve bilimin doğası öğretiminin farklı aşamalarında işe yarar olduğunu söyleyebiliriz.

AB  - This study examines the process by which system thinking perceptions develop within the context of a water cycle curriculum. Four junior high school students undergoing an especially designed inquiry-based intervention were closely observed before, during, immediately after, and 6 years after completing a year long systems-based learning program. The employed research tools included observations, semi-structured interviews, and a number of “concept viewing” tools (drawings, concept maps, and repertory grids). Out of the data, four distinct “stories,” each presenting a different way of constructing hydro system mental models, are described. The paper's main conclusion is that students develop their systems mental models and remember the learned material based on learning patterns that tend to remain unchanged over time. Consequently, in order to facilitate efficient and lasting construction of students' system models, learning experiences should harness these, and especially the meta-cognitive learning pattern, which holds special significance for constructing systems.

AB  - An increasing number of educational institutions and organizations around the world employ online training to address emerging challenges in teacher competence. Research literature, however, showed that few studies have been conducted that followed teachers in their respective schools after training to evaluate their classroom performance. Enthused by this lack of empirical proof, this study was conducted to assess the modifications on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) - an accepted construct in educational lexicon of nine non-major science teachers who were given a month-long, fully online training. Using a multi-method assessment procedure (e.g., achievement testing, concept mapping, lesson planning, and demonstration teaching), results disclose substantial alteration in two knowledge-based PCK components in science teaching - knowledge about science curriculum and students' understanding of science. A significant increase in achievement scores, better concept map structure and corrected misconceptions were observed after the training. Contrastingly, only little improvement was noted in the other two skill-based components - knowledge about instructional strategies and assessment in science. Few changes were noticed in teachers' topic-specific strategies and science learning assessment skills. Based on these findings, it appeared that fully online teacher trainings were insufficient in enhancing all facets of the complex nature of science teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - For beginning teachers to make the transition to full professional membership they need to increase their professional knowledge of the art and science of teaching. This paper explores the difference in knowledge growth between beginning teachers who commence teaching in fragmented teaching situations in the first two years of teaching, and their colleagues who have stable, secure and continuing employment during this time. This paper argues that the employment context in which beginning teachers take up their profession has a significant, but hitherto largely unacknowledged, effect on the capacity of teachers to develop the craft of teaching (Elbaz, 1983); on their continuing commitment to the profession; and on their self-confidence and self-image as teachers It is concluded that long-term, secure employment in one school, with full responsibility for a class of students and access to effective mentoring, is necessary if beginning teachers are to move beyond 'survival' to developing competency in the first two years of teaching.

AB  - To meet the needs of a diverse student population while addressing the knowledge and skills outcomes of the curriculum, faculty should develop a repertoire of instructional models. Research-based instructional models from the fields of education and health care have been developed to support various learner outcomes. Emphasis on evidence-based practice in the field of communication sciences and disorders should include increased study of research-based instructional practices in higher education. The present study examined the models of instruction currently implemented by professors in speech-language pathology graduate programs. Problem-based learning and induction were used most frequently, followed by direct instruction. Cooperative learning, memory strategy instruction, and role play were used less frequently. Results suggest that instructors are utilizing a variety of instructional models to meet learning outcomes. Implications for the use of models of instruction, as well as future directions for research, are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The writers compared collaborative writing to collaborative concept mapping.  Data were obtained from 248 secondary students who learned about circulatory system in 77 self-selected collaborative groups.  Learning outcomes of biology students who summarized by collaborative concept mapping were compared to students who summarized by collaborative writing.  Findings revealed that learning group assigned to construct concept maps instead of conventional summaries produced more relations in the summary task and members obtained higher individual scores on a post-test.  Concept mapping strategy was advantageous only for students who were placed in groups with other students having low cognitive ability and whose cognitive ability was below the median for the sample.

AB  - This paper explores conceptual variation in the depiction of gene function in upper secondary school textbooks. Historically, concepts in genetics have developed in various scientific frameworks, which has led to a level of incommensurability as concepts have changed over time within their respective frameworks. Since students may have difficulties in understanding concepts where there is implicit variation in descriptions of the same phenomena, we have developed a concept mapping instrument and applied it to study the gene function concepts in biology and chemistry textbooks that are widely used in Sweden, and others used in a selection of English speaking countries. The data were then further examined using content analysis. In the present paper we describe the conceptual variation of gene function as it is presented in the textbooks, and analyze the ways in which students’ understanding may be influenced. We conclude that it may be difficult for students to gain a modern, process-oriented understanding of gene function if textbooks are used as foundations for the planning and execution of lessons.

AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for non-traditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLiM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901,446 in total) for SLiM instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion.

AB  - This paper seeks to develop a methodology that will discover, specify and measure students’ abilities and skills in creating concept maps. Because competencies are the key factor in higher education, the paper analyzes the role of concept maps as a tool to diagnose and improve information analysis, synthesis, organization and representation skills and competencies. We propose a methodology that enables these skills to be evaluated by observing, analyzing and measuring the stages involved in creating a concept map: identification of the main and secondary subjects; subject codification by concepts; grading of concepts; and representation of the concepts and their relationships with labels. A case study using action research methodology tests its usefulness on a group of university students of library and information science. The method proposed provides information on the strengths and weaknesses of the students’ skills, thus enabling their training to be improved by means of specific actions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - This study used scientometric methods to conduct an automatic content analysis on the development trends of science education research from the published articles in the four journals of International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Research in Science Education, and Science Education from 1990 to 2007. The multi-stage clustering technique was employed to investigate with what topics, to what development trends, and from whose contribution that the journal publications constructed as a science education research field. This study found that the research topic of Conceptual Change & Concept Mapping was the most studied topic, although the number of publications has slightly declined in the 2000’s. The studies in the themes of Professional Development, Nature of Science and Socio-Scientific Issues, and Conceptual Chang and Analogy were found to be gaining attention over the years. This study also found that, embedded in the most cited references, the supporting disciplines and theories of science education research are constructivist learning, cognitive psychology, pedagogy, and philosophy of science.

AB  - Understanding of Earth’s systems, including the crucial role of human beings within them, is an important part of citizens’ ability to think intelligently and critically about the environment, pollution, sustainability and other socio-economic and scientific issues central to life in the modern world. Part of this understanding involves seeing the world as an integrated whole in which what happens in diverse places in the world may be equally relevant for students' lives. In this regard, it makes sense to study both remote and local environments within the system thinking approach—where such distinctions naturally become blurred. The present research, accordingly, focuses on a study unit entitled “Life at the Poles” and investigates the development of junior high school students’ understanding of Earth systems and their level of conceptual complexity as a result of participating in it. The “Life at the Poles” unit is based on the “explanatory story” approach where one central theme is used as a focal point for an interdisciplinary study of certain natural phenomena, in this case, the possibility of life under the extreme conditions at the poles. Concept maps and Likert-type questionnaires were employed as research tools, allowing the collected data to be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The research findings indicate that the students significantly improved their Earth systems understanding and, importantly, greatly increased their awareness of human beings’ influence on the environment, including remote environments such as the pole.

AB  - This paper explores the occurrence of conceptual incoherence in upper secondary school textbooks resulting from the use of multiple historical models. Swedish biology and chemistry textbooks, as well as a selection of books from English speaking countries, were examined. The purpose of the study was to identify which models are used to represent the phenomenon of gene function in textbooks and to investigate how these models relate to historical scientific models and subject matter contexts. Models constructed for specific use in textbooks were identified using concept mapping. The data were further analyzed by content analysis. The study shows that several different historical models are used in parallel in textbooks to describe gene function. Certain historical models were used more often then others and the most recent scientific views were rarely referred to in the textbooks. Hybrid models were used frequently, i.e. most of the models in the textbooks consisted of a number of components of several historical models. Since the various historical models were developed as part of different scientific frameworks, hybrid models exhibit conceptual incoherence, which may be a source of confusion for students. Furthermore, the use of different historical models was linked to particular subject contexts in the textbooks studied. The results from Swedish and international textbooks were similar, indicating the general applicability of our conclusions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study reported here encouraged students to learn about water resource by using a case scenario on local water problems. After each group of students studied the case, students were asked to search for more information on local water resources, water quality, and comparative quality of water. A local sage was invited to give a talk to the students who later used the knowledge gained to discuss the way to solve the case problems. Students reported their ideas to friends as well as constructed their own webblog to present what they had learned. Students' presentation, report, webblog, concept map, pre-post test, and observation were used to assess their achievements from this lesson. The average score was 75.38 from 100 points indicating that most students achieved the objectives of the lesson. They could build knowledge from the case, search for information on their own, and discuss with friends as well as present the understanding via the webblog. Some problems still need to be solved such as allowing for more time and providing computer each for the student who did not own one. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The paper presents the effect of a free word association test, content analysis and concept mapping on students' achievements in human biology. The free word association test was used for revealing the scientific conceptual structures of 8th grade and 12th grade students, around a stimulus word - human being - and for motivating them to study human biology. The stimulus word retrieved a cluster of associations most of which were based on science education and experience. Associations with the stimulus word were analyzed and classified according to predetermined criteria and structured by means of a concept map. The stimulus word 'human being' was quantitatively assessed in order to find out the balance between the associations with its different aspects. On the basis of the results some connections between biology and other sciences studying the human being, were worked out. Each new topic in human biology was studied by using content analysis of the textbook and concept mapping as study tools and thus maintaining students' motivation. Achievements of students were assessed by means of tests, observation and concept maps evaluation. The obtained data was also valuable in clarifying the complex nature of the human being, and confirming the statement that biology cannot answer all questions, concerning human nature. Inferences were made about the word association test combined with content analysis and concept map construction as an educational strategy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A study examined the cognitive and motivation effects within different educational instructional schemes:  on the one hand, teacher-centered versus hands-on instruction and, on the other hand, hands-on instruction and without a knowledge consolidation phase, that is concept mapping.  While the teacher-centered approach gave higher short-term learning success, hands-on instruction led to relatively lower decrease rates.  However, after six weeks, all students attained similar levels of newly acquired knowledge.  Nevertheless, concept mapping as a knowledge consolidation phase positively influenced short-term increase in knowledge.

AB  - This study aimed to determine how 33 urban 5th grade students' science conceptions changed during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds. Research on watershed and place-based education was used as a framework to guide the teaching of the unit as well as the research study. A teacher-researcher designed the curriculum, taught the unit and conducted the research using qualitative data sources such as concept maps, science notebooks and interviews. Most students came to understand that their watershed was part of an urban environment where water drains from the surrounding land into a body of water. Thus, they began to understand how urban land use affects water quality. This study provides evidence for the use of place-based learning in developing students' knowledge of the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) and watersheds. Implications of this study include the use of place-based learning in urban settings and the experiences needed for students to conceptualize watersheds.

AB  - Aim: This article is intended to be a layman introduction to the methodology commonly used in complexity science studies, emphasizes holistic consideration, description on the entire pattern against bits and pieces of sectional analysis, use of metaphors to build up integration of ostensibly incompatible features such as simultaneous co-existence of land and rivers, hills and valleys in the landscape portraits, a popular tool in complexity studies. The setting of analysis used in this article falls in the arena of recent hot debate on how curriculum on Sustainable Development Education should be designed, a vehicle to illustrate application of Dynamical Systems Theory. Background: Curriculum re-engineering has been around for decades throughout the world; school-based curricula, innovative central curricula, inter-disciplinary projects, to name but a few. Some did not last long because of territorial biases; some made a fad and faded. The irony lay in the immediate demise of projects that claimed a success in their pilot run. We had topics like environment conservation, globalization, followed by global warming infiltrating the classrooms these past years. Now the limelight is on sustainable development. Is it late? That is not the issue. Our main concern is how our innovations may stand out against all odds and survive the times. Discussion: This article depicts application of Chaos Theory, Complexity Theories and Dynamical Systems Theory to understand how new trades, new academic subjects or new research interests arise and go, and argues that design for sustainable development education should embrace new elements of skills in its curriculum, and has to be inter-disciplinary. The author further argues for inclusion of complexity science elements (a series of superficially independent incidents may attenuate and demise or else, amplify through positive feedback mechanism and surprise the world with revolutionary change). However, the change could never be explained completely without an introduction of time element into the chain of change episodes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs ( n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The writers describe a course called Biochemistry of the Envenomation Response that aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses.  The contents were organized by modules and the topic complexity gradually increased.  An active-learning strategy was used that focused on concept map drawing.  Evaluations were obtained through a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by 90 students.  Findings revealed that 84 percent of the students thought that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course.

AB  - Information technology (IT) students at higher educational institutions have in general found difficulty in grasping object-oriented (OO) concepts. They particularly find difficulty in performing abstractions of real-world problems within the context of object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD). They are unable to effectively build models from the problem domain because they essentially do not know 'what' to model. Concept mapping is a popular tool used in education for facilitating learning, comprehension and the development of knowledge. Within the context of OOAD, we successfully used concept maps to help students understand and master the technique of abstraction in order that they can improve their OO modelling skills and produce more appropriate OOAD models. We present a set of guidelines for teaching OO modelling with concept maps. These guidelines (consisting of four teaching modules) could be integrated into existing OOAD courses at undergraduate or postgraduate level, and OOAD workshops to help software engineering educators resolve some of the difficulties they face when teaching OOAD. This paper contains results of our evaluation of the effectiveness of integrating the concept mapping techniques in an introductory OOAD course. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The consideration of threshold concepts is offered in the context of biological education as a theoretical framework that may have utility in the teaching and learning of biology at all levels. Threshold concepts may provide a mechanism to explain the observed punctuated nature of conceptual change. This perspective raises the profile of periods of conceptual stasis from 'failure to learn' to necessary periods within the normal pattern of student learning. Threshold concepts are seen as points where segmental/linear knowledge structures and cumulative/hierarchical knowledge structures are integrated, resulting in a transformation in understanding. 'Evolution' and 'dynamic transformation' are nominated as candidate threshold concepts within biology.

AB  - This article describes how science can lead whole-school curriculum change at key stage 3 (ages 11-14). Two thematic curriculum models are described. Model 1 shows how science specialists can develop student understanding of how science interrelates to a variety of other subject areas, while Model 2 shows how science might help to create a 'learning community' of subject specialists through concept mapping across subject areas. Both models encourage collaborative approaches to curriculum design and ultimately learning, with a major emphasis being placed on science, its relationship with other curriculum areas and its importance in our society.

AB  - At the microscopic level, there are many concepts that appear too complicated to all grades of students; especially those concerning chemical reactions. Most students have difficulty in imagining things and understanding the relevant concepts. In science, activity–based learning is deemed an appropriate method to improve students' understanding of complicated concepts. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry–based learning unit on chemical reaction for grade eight students by using a newly developed activity called "Tapioca Bomb" for demonstrating concepts of chemical reaction. The students had opportunities to investigate by hands–on and mind–on activities. After observing the explosion in the Tapioca Bomb activity, the students were able to build their own concepts on chemical reaction and connect science learning to everyday life. The students could explain how and why the reaction occurred, and could apply their preliminary knowledge to design their own experiment. Finally, the teacher and students discussed what they had learned and applied the knowledge gained. The results on pre–test and post–test, concept map, students' documents, CLES questionnaire and interviews indicated that this learning unit helped students conceptualize the knowledge on combustion chemical reaction.

AB  - This paper discusses how techniques for representing knowledge, such as concept maps could be effectively used in a technical writing classroom for the conceptual understanding of a problem and as a visualization strategy for complex technical documents. The motivation behind using the knowledge models (concept maps) for an engineering/computer science oriented technical writing class is based on the importance of understanding different knowledge representations in an engineering / Computer Science document and the fact that the ease of solving such a problem is almost completely determined by ways in which problem is conceptualized and represented. In this project, we argue for the importance of using specific kinds of concept maps, such as ladders, in a technical writing class offered for computer science majors. A survey–based study with 25 students from a technical thesis writing class, reported in this article suggested that advanced students in an EFL technical thesis writing course have enough expertise to understand the use and application of specialized concept maps for technical document production activities. Results indicate that students, on most part, understand specific inference–based applications of concept maps in documents, tasks and especially specific sentences in the domain of computer science. Self–reports also indicated that students are reasonable confident about their ability to apply different types of concept maps in logical ways. Teaching evidence suggested that use of concept maps should be effectively integrated both during planning stages and as part of traditional document production techniques. Assignments and activities in a technical writing classroom (e.g., software manual design, quick guides, FAQ, brochures, lab reports etc) should address the use of concept maps for conceptualizing, schematizing and presenting procedural information logically and structurally. Using concept maps efficiently can lead to structural and functional conceptualization, visualization, representation and retention of complex information. The entire English curriculum in this institute designed as "English for computer science" involved students using concept maps from freshman to senior years for conceptualizing and articulating computer science concepts.

AB  - The system of natural language enables members of human species to externalize and exchange thoughts within the social group, and through the intervention of writing system. The human language system has generative power which, according to the Cognitive Architectural Model, rests on its tripartite architecture. In this architecture, there lies language–relevant information in, at least, three specific distinct representational formats: the meaning; the syntax; and the sound structures of words and utterances. In this paper, the Levelt and Reolofs Cognitive Architectural model is examined, and attempts are made to apply it to the learning and teaching of English for Science and Technology (EST). It is discovered that the cognitive machinery of language embodies both production and comprehension which instantiates a continuous internal dialogue between the instructor and the learner. It equally recognises that the Model significantly factors in and showcases a feedforward process and a spreading–activation of principles of lemma retrieval in speaking which are well–established in Stimulus– Response Approach thus giving room for Feedback. This paper, however, criticises the theory of isolating speaking single words as emphasized by the model without references to explicit explanations and integration of other language skills such as listening, reading and writing, and predicts that such practice is bound to fail in pedagogical situations. The paper recommends, among others, that the Model should incorporate continued discourse in order to meet the English language requirements of learners of science and technology. To successfully apply the Model, the paper also recommends the use of inquiry teaching and learning approach and concept–mapping strategy simultaneously. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate a collaborative concept-mapping technique that was integrated into coteaching in fourth-grade science classes in order to examine students' performance and attitudes toward the experimental teaching method. There are two fourth-grade science teachers and four classes with a total of 114 students involved in the study. This study used a mixed method design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings showed that the two teaching methods obtained significant difference with respect to students' test scores. Using collaborative concept mapping to learn science could increase the opportunity of discussion between peers, thus fostering better organization and understanding the content. In addition, coteaching could enable teachers to share their expertise with one another. It could facilitate the implementation of collaborative concept mapping and the construction of student's concept mapping. Team teachers' attitude could affect the students' learning performance. However, some of the students had negative views on drawing concept maps because they found it was troublesome to write down many words, difficult to draw and arrange proposition, and time-consuming. Coteachers' instant feedback and students' journal writing could guide and examine the students' concept maps to facilitate their cognitive learning..

AB  - This study (1) explores the effectiveness of the contextualized history of science on student learning of nature of science (NOS) and genetics content knowledge (GCK), especially interrelationships among various genetics concepts, in high school biology classrooms; (2) provides an exemplar for teachers on how to utilize history of science in genetics instruction; and (3) suggests a modified concept mapping assessment tool for both NOS and GCK. A quasi-experimental control group research design was utilized with pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests, combining qualitative data and quantitative data. The experimental group was taught with historical curricular lessons, while the control group was taught with non-historical curricular lessons. The results indicated that students in the experimental group developed better understanding in targeted aspects of NOS immediately after the intervention and retained their learning 2 months after the intervention. Both groups developed similar genetics knowledge in the posttest, and revealed a slight decay in their understanding in the delayed posttest. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, “Stars and Sun”, through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Background: This study deals with the application of concept mapping to the teaching and learning of a science topic with secondary school students in Germany. Purpose: The main research questions were: (1) Do different teaching approaches affect concept map structure or students' learning success? (2) Is the structure of concept maps influenced by gender? (3) Is the concept map structure a reliable indicator of students' learning success? Sample: One hundred and forty-nine high-achieving 5th-grade students from four German secondary schools participated in the study. The average age of participants was 10½ years. Gender distribution was balanced. Students produced concept maps working in small, single-sex groups. Design and methods: There were two teaching approaches used: one based upon teacher-centred instruction and one consisting of student-centred learning. Both were followed by a concept-mapping phase. Student groups experienced either one or the other teaching approach. Concept map structures were analysed using of the method of Kinchin, Hay and Adams. We defined three different possible types of concept map structure: spokes, chains and nets. Furthermore, for assessing a student's short- and longer-term learning success, we constructed a multiple-choice knowledge test applied in a pre-, post-, retention-test design. Parametric tests, such as MANOVA, one-way ANOVA and t-tests were used to identify any differences in gender, teaching approach, number of nets per concept map and their interactions. Results: Type of teaching approach had an effect on concept map structure but not on students' longer-term learning success. Students of the teacher-centred approach produced more net structures than those students who participated in the hands-on instruction. Subsequent analyses showed in total more net structures for female groups. The interaction of gender and number of nets per concept map showed a significant effect on students' longer-term learning success. Conclusion: The study suggests that Kinchin's classification scheme for assessing concept map quality may be a good indicator of students' learning success when applied in combination with a knowledge test.

Each assessment method probed a different aspect of models (from growth in scientific use to need for greater emphasis on the role and use of models) and each used a different method of gathering student responses (Likert-type responses to concept maps). We determined that growth in student knowledge was demonstrated by all instruments, but some instruments were more useful than others for determining preservice elementary teachers’ prior knowledge as well as growth in knowledge of models necessary for K-8 teachers.

AB  - Concept mapping is a meta-learning strategy based on the Ausubel-Novak-Gowin theory of meaningful learning. In a concept map, concepts are related with linking words to form propositions. By expanding this concept-proposition link, one eventually forms a web of concepts whose meanings are embedded in the presented map. The paper describes the author's experience with students' use of concept maps and how concept maps are scored. The strategy was utilized as an advance organizer and as an assessment tool (for diagnostic and summative purposes). Sample concept maps constructed by students taking up Introductory Physics are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called “Laboratory Experiments in Science Education” based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers’ conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article, we describe an innovative capstone course for preservice K-8 teachers integrating action research and a unifying theme in science (AAAS in Science for all Americans. Oxford University Press, New York, ; NRC in National science education standards. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, ). The goals of the capstone course are to increase student knowledge of the unifying theme, improve written communication skills, and introduce students to educational research. We provide evidence that each of these goals is met. Student growth in theme knowledge is demonstrated through concept maps, questionnaires, and previously reported assessments. Improved writing ability is demonstrated using the spelling and grammar checking feature of Microsoft Word. The analysis of action research reports demonstrates that students are able to connect their action research project results to previous research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Citation analysis has become a proven tool in research evaluation and policy relevant studies. Recently, J.E. Hirsch has suggested a new indicator, one single index for the assessment of the research performance of individual scientists. In a short time, Hirsch' definition was easily adapted to citations of journals and articles. The aim of this study is to discuss both what Hirsch index evolution explains us for Journal of Biological Education (JBE) and biological educational subjects which affect h-index of that journal. A case study is conducted for the h-index of JBE over period 2000-2005. By the term variable citation window h-index it meant that it was considered as a fixed moment in time when citations were collected from Web of Science. The evolution of JBE Hirsch index is shown with the self citations and the elimination of journal self citations in related figures. From the data, the Pearson correlation coefficients of regression lines are determined. The quantitative findings show that the h-index evolution of JBE has a positive trend determined in the case of the self and elimination self-citations of the journal over period 2000-2005. Furthermore, the most cited articles are about understanding of students on biological subjects, developing concept mapping in biology and students' attitutes towards biology teaching.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of metaconceptual teaching interventions on students’ understanding of force and motion concepts. A multimethod research design including quasi-experimental design and case study designs was employed to compare the effect of the metaconceptual activities and traditional instruction and investigate students’ reactions to metaconceptual teaching interventions. The participants (45 high school students in the USA) were enrolled in one of the two physics classes instructed by the same science teacher. In the experimental group, students’ engagement in metaconceptual knowledge and processes was facilitated through various instructional activities, including poster drawing, journal writing, group debate, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. These activities were intended to facilitate students’ engagement in (a) becoming aware of their existing and past conceptions, associated beliefs, everyday experiences, and contextual differences, (b) monitoring their understanding of the new conception, the changes in ideas, and the consistency between existing and new conceptions, and (c) evaluating the relative ability of competing conceptions to explain a physical phenomenon. In the comparison group, the same content knowledge was explained by the teacher along with the use of laboratory experiments, demonstrations, and quantitative problem solving. Students’ reactions to the designed instructional activities indicated that metaconceptual teaching interventions were successful in facilitating students’ engagement in several types of metaconceptual functioning. The results showed that students in the experimental group had significantly better conceptual understanding than their counterparts in the comparison group and this positive impact remained after a period of 9 weeks.

AB  - Academic language in social studies lessons is challenging for English Language Learners because of the language barrier. Social studies teachers need to make use of effective techniques that can help English Language Learners overcome the language barrier. Graphic organizers are promising tools for making content more comprehensible for English Language Learners. In this article it is suggested that Inspiration®, a software program that allows production of electronic concept maps in an easy process with minimum learning curve, can help social studies teachers teach English Language Learners more effectively, as well as enhance their language development. Inspiration® is presented as an instructional tool that can help social studies teachers understand the linguistic needs of English Language Learners (ELLs) and incorporate appropriate academic language of different types of language functions prevalent within the discourse structures of social studies textbooks with the help of Inspiration®, such as the language of describing the process of making laws, comparing and contrasting two branches of the American government, and sequencing of events in making of the American constitution.

AB  - Developing personalised web-based learning systems has been an important research issue in e-learning because no fixed learning pathway will be appropriate for all learners. However, most current web-based learning platforms with personalised curriculum sequencing tend to emphasise the learner preferences and interests in relation to personalised learning services but fail to consider the difficulty level of course materials, learning order of prior and posterior knowledge and learner abilities while constructing a personalised learning path. As a result, these ignored factors thus easily lead to the generation of poor quality learning paths. Generally, learners could generate cognitive overload or fall into cognitive disorientation owing to inappropriate curriculum sequencing during learning processes, thus, reducing the learning effect. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, ontology technologies enable a linguistic infrastructure to represent conceptual relationships between course materials. Ontology can be served as a structured knowledge representation scheme, capable of assisting the construction of a personalised learning path. This study thus proposes a novel genetic-based curriculum sequencing scheme based on a generated ontology-based concept map, which can be automatically constructed by the pretest results of numerous learners, to plan appropriate learning paths for individual learners. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach could create high-quality learning paths for individual learners. The proposed approach thus can help learners to learn more effectively and to likely reduce learners' cognitive overloads during learning processes. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - When discussing the topic “Hunger in Africa” with students, incorrect and biased ideas on the causes for hunger are revealed. In order to change the students' personal concepts it is necessary to become acquainted with their mental models. Therefore, a survey of Geography students' different personal theories concerning “Hunger in Africa” was carried out. By means of interviews followed by concept mapping, the various personal theories were identified. It became apparent that the students mostly rely on climate and the population growth as arguments to explain the occurrence of hunger in Africa. The greatest difference between the personal and the scientific theories was that the students included almost no external influences, whether economic or political, in their explanations but relied mostly on factors within a country when formulating their statements. The research literature commonly suggests that there are three steps in reshaping learners' “misconceptions”. The first is to make the present views explicitly the subject of the discussion. At this point the experiences that led to these views should be reflected on and newly interpreted. Second, the newly acquired knowledge must prove itself when used in certain contexts. Finally, during the process, a cooperative culture of learning must prevail, where the learner is convinced that he can control his own acquisition of knowledge. On the basis of these insights, teaching aids were developed that allow students to check their own personal concepts, to dismiss them and to align them with scientific concepts.

AB  - This article presents a critical review and analysis of key studies that have been done in science education and other areas on the effects and effectiveness of using diagrams, graphs, photographs, illustrations, and concept maps as adjunct visual aids in the learning of scientific-technical content. It also summarizes and reviews those studies that have students draw diagrams, graphs, maps, and charts to express their understandings of the concepts and relationships that are present in the text they read or/and empirical data provided (i.e., student-generated adjunct visual productions). In general, the research and theory on instructional aids is fragmented and somewhat unsystematic with several flaws and a number of key uncontrolled variables, which actually suppress and mask effects in the studies that have been done. The findings of these studies are compared to relevant literature and empirical research and findings in the areas of cognitive psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence that help to clarify many of the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of effects found for visual (e.g., diagrams and graphs) instructional aids in the science education literature currently and in the past 20 years. A model and a set of criteria and goals for improving research in this area is then described, as visuals are a first step in the process of learning formal (scientific) models, which are most often visually represented. Understanding how students learn formal models is one the outstanding research challenges in the next 20 years, both within and outside of science education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigated how well 74 6th-grade science students represented text structures from a 900-word textbook chapter on soil conservation, given a concept map template with four superordinate terms and 24 unsorted concepts. Findings suggest students were more successful at classifying pre-selected terms under given superordinate categories than they were at fully identifying relevant concept sets and articulating three different relationship types between terms. No significant differences were noted in the mapping performance of students at different reading levels. About two-third of students indicated they enjoyed concept mapping and would prefer to both read and map rather than just read without mapping. Students also expressed a strong preference for mapping in pairs or small groups compared to mapping alone. Multiple recommendations are provided for improving the relational thinking of students tasked with concept mapping expository science texts, including bridging to more open-ended maps, embedding mapping in longer-term inquiry projects, and leveraging collaborative and tool-based scaffolds.

AB  - A study examined teacher candidates' knowledge of the concepts of impulse and momentum by comparing and contrasting students' concept maps and an achievement test.  Findings revealed that the mean teacher candidates' concept map scores are very low when compared with the scores of the achievement test.  Furthermore, findings showed that even though a great number of concepts were identified, not many relationships were established between these concepts.  The weak correlation between the achievement test and the concept map scores occurs because concept maps evaluate students' knowledge from a conceptual perspective while achievement tests measure the level of students' knowledge on the topic and their ability to use this knowledge in different settings.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. Th e study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkale University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators.

AB  - "Slowmation" (abbreviated from "Slow Motion Animation) is a new yet simple form of stopmotion animation which enables learners to create their own animations of science concepts. This paper presents a study of preservice elementary teachers in a science method classes (14 in one class in 2009) to ascertain if they improved their science knowledge when using a three phase framework requiring them to: (i) create their own Slowmation about a science concept; (ii) upload them to a web site (www.slowmation.com.au) so that they could be reviewed by a peer and a content expert; and (iii) if necessary, modify the animation and reupload it to be published on the Slowmation website. The two research questions were: (i) How did the three phase framework change the preservice teachers' science content knowledge and (ii) What was the value and motivation of the web site, for uploading and reviewing the animations? Qualitative data (three interviews, two concept maps and the animations as knowledge artifacts) collected from each preservice teacher showed that all of them increased their science content knowledge as a result of using the framework. Uploading the Slowmations to the website was successful for the students and enabled them to view other animations and created a social motivation to make and improve their animations. Getting preservice teachers to create Slowmations is a new way for them to engage with science content knowledge and is a new way for them to represent their science understandings.

AB  - A study was conducted to examine students' geocognition of deep time, conceptualized in an informal educational setting.  Students taking a Landscape Architecture Design 1 course developed solutions implementing geologic time for an informal education site.  Those who used abstract metaphors for their designs were more successful than those who went through with a linear design construct.  Pre- and posttest evaluations using the Petrified Wood Survey and student-constructed timelines indicated that 75 percent of geoscience content knowledge is required for successful design, and relative understanding of Earth events and the barrenness of early Earth's landscape is also a prerequisite for successful design implementation.  Findings indicate that concept statements with accompanying concept maps facilitate student cognition by requiring student comprehension and application of geoscience content knowledge.

AB  - This article describes some of the underlying conceptualizations that have gone into the work of the BEAR Center in the development of learning progressions. The core of all of these developments has been the construct map, which is the first building block in the BEAR Assessment System (BAS). After introducing the concept of a learning progression, the article summarizes the elements of the BAS, emphasizing the central concept of a construct map. The article then describes a series of several different ways to see the relationship between the idea of a construct map and the idea of a progression (which I call the “assessment structure”), and also gives illustrative examples from recent BEAR projects. The article then discusses some strengths and limitations of these conceptualizations, focusing on both educational and measurement issues. The article concludes with some general reflections.

AB  - Problem Statement: The effectiveness of science instruction, which aims to assure students' complete and accurate understanding of science concepts, can only be effectively evaluated when it is measured using the appropriate measurement tools. Concept maps, multiple-choice tests, and interviews - all of which are employed in determining students' understanding of science concepts - have been shown to be successful methods. However, each has its own limitations. In determining students' understanding of concepts, the use of two-tier tests - which evaluate students' understanding more effectively and which are easy to score and apply - is recommended. Purpose of Study: One of the topics of biology that students experience great difficulty in understanding is genetics. This study aims at developing a two-tier test which is able to effectively evaluate secondary education students' understanding of the concepts of genetics, and conducting the validity and reliability analyses of the test. Methods: The two-tier test, which is aimed at determining secondary education students' understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetics, was developed using a three-phase method. In the first phase, the test content was defined. In the second phase, the relevant literature was examined so as to determine students' misunderstandings; students were interviewed, and they were given a multiple choice test with free-response answers in which they had to explain the reasons for their answers. In the third phase, 14 two-tier test items which were composed of multiple choice content questions in the first tier and a set of five justifications for every potentially selected response to the first tier were developed. The test was applied to 231 students, and then item analysis was performed. Test reliability was calculated using the Kuder-Richardson 20 formula. In order to determine construct validity, the method of group differences was employed. Findings and Results: The discrimination indices of items were found to be between 0.34 and 0.74. Item difficulties fell in the range of 0.25 to 0.67, and the test difficulty was found to be 0.43. Test reliability was calculated as 0.86. Conclusions: All the findings obtained from the item analysis, in addition to the findings from the validity and the reliability studies; demonstrate that the test may be utilized to determine secondary education students' understanding of the concepts of genetics concepts in a valid and reliable way. Recommendations: Besides making a more effective evaluation possible, two-tier tests facilitate application and scoring. Therefore, we believe that developing and using such two-tier diagnostic tests in various fields will make significant contributions to science instruction. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A study examined how concept cartoons, together with other diagnostic and scaffolding tools, could be utilized in formative assessment to stimulate talk and argumentation among students in small groups and to provide diagnostic feedback about students' misconceptions to the teacher for teaching toward conceptual change.  Data were gathered from two classes of Primary 5 and 6 students in Singapore who worked in small groups to discuss the opposing perspectives posed by the cartoon characters.  Scaffolding tools were utilized to guide students' discussions and to assess, challenge, and document each others' ideas.  They also resorted to drawings to represent their ideas.  The discussion of one group was audio-recorded.  Findings revealed that students engaged in dialogic talk and interactive argumentation where they made their reasoning visible.  Their contentions and concerns had formative potential as they encouraged exploratory and reflective discourse by drawing upon each others' ideas.  The discursive practices of the teacher, as well as her role in designing scaffolding structures for promoting “assessment conversations” when utilizing concept cartoons and in devising strategies that consider students' conceptual and epistemic thinking, are emphasized.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to derive a conceptual model for information science, which is both academically sound and practically useful, particularly for curriculum design. Design/methodology/approach - The approach takes the form of a conceptual analysis, based on an extensive literature review, going back to the earliest days of information science. Findings - A conceptual model is derived, based on the study of components of the information chain through approaches of domain analysis, plus "fringe" topics and a meta-level consideration of the discipline itself. Links to related subjects may be derived systematically from this model. Originality/value - This is the first paper to suggest that a useful model for information science can be derived, based on the idea of studying the communication chain by means of domain analysis.

AB  - Despite scores of studies examining various factors influencing Malaysian students' understanding of science concepts, very few have actually looked into how the meaning of a specific concept is formed. This study was carried out to examine language influences on Malaysian children's understanding of concepts relating to germination of seeds. Through the use of interview, concept maps and written test, the author examines how language affects the development of meaning and understanding. Science lessons were also observed to determine how language use in the classroom influences children's understanding. It was found that children possess a myriad of understandings of each of the concepts examined prior to and after instruction, indicating that linguistic elements influence the formation of conceptual understanding as well as the way meaning is assigned to each of the concepts.

AB  - Walaupun banyak kajian telah dijalankan tentang faktor yang mempengaruhi pemahaman konsep sains pelajar Malaysia, hanya sedikit yang mengkaji bagaimana makna sesuatu konsep sains itu dibina. Kajian ini dijalankan untuk mengenal pasti pengaruh bahasa kanak-kanak Malaysia ke atas pemahaman konsep sains berkaitan dengan percambahan bijih benih. Penulis menggunakan kaedah temubual, lakaran peta konteks dan ujian bertulis untuk mengenal pasti bagaimana bahasa mempengaruhi pembinaan bahasa serta pemahaman kanak-kanak. Pembelajaran sains dalam bilik darjah turut dicerap untuk tujuan yang sama. Dapatan kajian menunjukkan kanak-kanak mempunyai pelbagai pemahaman saintifik dan tidak saintifik tentang konsep yang dikaji sebelum dan selepas pembelajaran. Ini menunjukkan bahawa elemen linguistik memang mempengaruhi pemahaman konsep serta makna yang tersirat dan tersurat di sebalik setiap konsep. (Indonesian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper presents research findings related to the "Dynamic Enhanced Evaluation of Problem Solving (DEEP)" (Spector & Koszalka. 2004) methodology lot assessing how participants conceptualize ill-defined problems in biology using annotated concept maps. The methodology engages highly experienced (expert) and less experienced (novice) participants in creating annotated problem representations. This exploratory study addressed the lack of assessment methods to assess learning progress and relative level of expertise in complex, dynamic domains. This paper addresses (I) differences between experts and novices. (2) learning in complex domains, and (3) the rational for using annotated concept maps to assess learning in complex domains. Findings suggest that there are similarities in how experts think about ill-defined problems and these similarities are different than novices. These findings thus suggest that this methodology is useful in distinguishing relative levels of expertise in conceptualization of complex and challenging problems in a biology context.

AB  - The use of concept maps as instruments for assessing preservice teachers' epistemologies of science (their ideas of the nature of scientific knowledge) was evaluated in this study. Twenty-three preservice elementary teachers' responses to the Views of the Nature Of Science (VNOS) questionnaire were compared to concept maps created in response to the general probe, “What is science?” While VNOS responses allowed a richer analysis of the content and quality of the participants' epistemologies, the concept maps provided information about structural changes of participants' epistemologies as well as how those epistemologies relate to their overall conceptions of science as a field of study. Both instruments also revealed important connections between NOS tenets, which were more numerous on the concept maps but more informative on the VNOS, and between NOS tenets and pedagogical issues. Implications for assessment of students' epistemologies of science in classrooms are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This research is concerned with preservice teacher understanding of six earth and space science concepts that are often taught in elementary school: the reason for seasons, phases of the moon, why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two sections of a science methods course (N= 52) completed an open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest) demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher s understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. Concept mapping had an additive effect in building understanding, as evident on the second posttest. The findings suggest useful strategies for university science instructors to use in clarifying science concepts while modeling activities teachers can use in their own classrooms.

AB  - Our paper presents an in-service primary school teachers’ training program which is based on the idea that the history of science can play a vital role in promoting the learning of physics. This training program has been developed in the context of Comenius 2.1 which is a European Union program. This program that we have developed in the University of Athens is based on socioconstructivist and sociocultural learning principles with the intention of helping teachers to appropriate the basic knowledge on the issue of falling bodies. Moreover, it has the aim to make explicit through the exploitation of authentic historical science events, on the above topic (Aristotle’s, Galileo’s and Newton’s theories on falling bodies) the Nature of Science (NoS), the Nature of Learning (NoL) and the Nature of Teaching (NoT). During the implementation of the program we have used a variety of teaching strategies (e.g. group work, making of posters, making of concept maps, simulations) that utilize historical scientific materials on the issue of falling bodies.

AB  - We address four main areas in which graduate quantum mechanics education can be improved: course content, textbook, teaching methods, and assessment tools. We report on a three year longitudinal study at the Colorado School of Mines using innovations in all these areas. In particular, we have modified the content of the course to reflect progress in the field of quantum mechanics over the last 50 years, used textbooks that include such content, incorporated a variety of teaching techniques based on physics education research, and used a variety of assessment tools to study the effectiveness of these reforms. We present a new assessment tool, the Graduate Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey, and further testing of a previously developed assessment tool, the Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey. We find that graduate students respond well to research-based techniques that have been tested mainly in introductory courses, and that they learn much of the new content introduced in each version of the course. We also find that students' ability to answer conceptual questions about graduate quantum mechanics is highly correlated with their ability to solve calculational problems on the same topics. In contrast, we find that students' understanding of basic undergraduate quantum mechanics concepts at the modern physics level is not improved by instruction at the graduate level.

AB  - We present the results of a national study on the teaching and learning of astronomy as taught in general education, non-science-major, introductory astronomy courses. Nearly 4000 students enrolled in 69 sections of courses taught by 36 different instructors at 31 institutions completed (pre- and post-instruction) the Light and Spectroscopy Concept Inventory (LSCI) from Fall 2006 to Fall 2007. The classes varied in size and `were from all types of institutions, including 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. Normalized gain scores for each class were calculated. Pre-instruction LSCI scores were clustered around -25%, independent of class size and institution type, and normalized gain scores varied from about -0.07 to 0.50. To estimate the fraction of classroom time spent on learner-centered, active-engagement instruction we developed and administered an Interactivity Assessment Instrument (IAI). Our results suggest that the differences in gains were due to instruction in the classroom, not the type of class or institution. We also found that higher interactivity classes had the highest gains, confirming that interactive learning strategies are capable of increasing student conceptual understanding. However, the wide range of gain scores seen for both lower and higher interactivity classes suggests that the use of interactive learning strategies is not sufficient by itself to achieve high student gain.

AB  - This study examined hand drawn concept maps from 34 students, ages 17-55, enrolled in a community college environmental biology class. Maps were collected three times during the semester-long course, and analyzed using graphical representation and structural analysis to determine the level of complexity at which students organized and learned the content of environmental science. Graphical changes within concept maps showed a significant increase in the number of complex network-style concept maps generated with a Chi-square analysis calculated a x2.05(2) = 7.52, which exceeds the critical value of 5.99. Structural components within concept maps measured linear increases in the number of nodes, links, and link terms or propositions used. Map components increased by 29% and 35% for nodes and links respectively, and by the end of the semester, measured a 70% increase in proposition usage. In conclusion, significant increases in map propositions and graphical complexity support how students develop skills in articulation of knowledge and demonstrate a more literate understanding of environmental science content.

AB  - A consensus map of science is generated from an analysis of 20 existing maps of science. These 20 maps occur in three basic forms: hierarchical, centric, and noncentric (or circular). The consensus map, generated from consensus edges that occur in at least half of the input maps, emerges in a circular form. The ordering of areas is as follows: mathematics is (arbitrarily) placed at the top of the circle, and is followed clockwise by physics, physical chemistry, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences, biology, biochemistry, infectious diseases, medicine, health services, brain research, psychology, humanities, social sciences, and computer science. The link between computer science and mathematics completes the circle. If the lowest weighted edges are pruned from this consensus circular map, a hierarchical map stretching from mathematics to social sciences results. The circular map of science is found to have a high level of correspondence with the 20 existing maps, and has a variety of advantages over hierarchical and centric forms. A one-dimensional Riemannian version of the consensus map is also proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The researchers investigated the comparative effects of individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning.  One hundred and sixty one students completed the entire study.  Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, students were assigned to three groups:  a self-selected study strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a collaborative pairs–concept mapping group.  Collaboratively and individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept learning as measured on a comprehension test.  However, the students who collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding.

AB  - This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map editor) with social education students.  Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning.  Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure.  Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use has been studied over the last few years.  CM-ED is a multilingual and multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps.  Until recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science university degree.  This paper represents a qualitative step in the evaluation of CM-ED:  from technical students to students of more theoretical fields.  The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and the carried out study are presented in this paper.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The research reported here consists of the introduction of an intervention based on a series of laboratory activities combined with concept mapping. The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students’ from two classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N = 31) and a second group (N = 28) who were taught in a more traditional manner. Student understanding of acid-base chemistry was evaluated with a pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument, the Concept Achievement Test (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable, helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions.

AB  - A concept map (CM) is a hierarchically arranged, graphic representation of the relationships among concepts. Concept mapping (CMING) is the process of constructing a CM. This paper examines whether a CMING strategy can be useful in helping students to improve their learning performance in a business and economics statistics course. A single factor, between subjects experimental design with three participant groups (collaborative concept mapping (CCMING) versus individual concept mapping (ICMING) versus traditional textbook exercises (TTE)) was employed. The experimental results suggest that adopting a CMING strategy can significantly improve student learning achievement in statistics, compared to using TTE, and adopting a CCMING improves student achievement even more than using ICMING. Furthermore, most of the students were satisfied with using CMING to learn statistics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Even though comprehension of human physiology is crucial in the clinical setting, students frequently learn part of this subject using rote memory and then are unable to transfer knowledge to other contexts or to solve clinical problems. This study evaluated the impact of articulating the concept map strategy with the mediated learning experience on meaningful learning during the cardiovascular module of a medical physiology course at Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga. This research was based on the ideas of David Ausubel (meaningful learning), Joseph Novak (concept maps), and Reuven Feuerstein (mediated learning experience). Students were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (mediated learning experience articulated with concept mapping) or a control group (traditional methodology). The intervention group constructed concept maps related to cardiovascular physiology and used them to solve problems related to this subject. The control group attended traditional discussion sessions and problem-solving sessions. All students were evaluated with two types of exams: problem-solving and multiple-choice exams. The intervention group performed significantly better on the problem-solving exams, but the difference was not significant in the multiple-choice exam. It was concluded that intervention promoted meaningful learning that allowed the students to transfer this knowledge to solve problems. The implemented strategy had a greater impact on the students who came into the study with the lowest cognitive competence, possibly because they were empowered by the intervention.

AB  - This paper presents research in Pan-European Public Services (PEPS) and Pan-European E-Government Services (PEGS). We examine different types of semantic interoperability issues that may arise when actors, information and services from different Member States (MS) need to cooperate and/or interoperate during the public service provision process. The semantic conflict types that arise in these cases are identified and classified according to a typology that is based on the combination of a known classification for semantic conflicts and domain specific concepts from the Governance Enterprise Architecture object model. This conceptual modelling describes and organizes the problem space, documents the requirements and can thus provide the basis for engineering solutions to resolve the identified conflicts.

AB  - Argumentation as a form of scientific discourse has been advocated as a fruitful method in science teaching. Information and communication technology (ICT) has been proposed as a vehicle to achieve pedagogic objectives in scientific argumentation. However, ICT as a new tool is likely to be ineffective when other factors are not taken into consideration. The empirical study described in this paper aims to investigate the use of ICT to support teaching and learning of argumentation from the users' perspectives. Four science pre-service teachers training as teachers at a postgraduate certificate in education programme in England have been introduced to a computer software called Belvedere 4.1, a tool designed particularly for supporting argumentation. The participants were tasked to produce a concept map with Belvedere 4.1, and subsequently they were invited to comment on the utility of Belvedere. Interviews with the participants explored their personal factors, pedagogic beliefs and experiences of using ICT in general in their teaching practice. The results indicate that the external conditions will limit the possibility of the use of ICT to improve teaching and learning of argumentation. Both the design and the structure of Belvedere, as well as the participants' personal factors contribute to the usability of the tool. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science teachers should remain focused on the central concept rather than topic-focused teaching to ensure students learn the big ideas.  Teachers should be very clear about what big idea students should know, carefully structure the instructional sequence to promote the learning of that central idea, and constantly revisit the big idea and question whether or not their teaching is targeting the big idea or getting sidetracked by details students really do not need to know.  The problem with emphasizing daily behavioral objectives in science is outlined.

AB  - This paper shows how concept mapping can be used to measure the quality of e-learning. Six volunteers (all of them 3rd-year medical students) took part in a programme of e-learning designed to teach the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The quality of change in individuals' maps was assessed using criteria developed to distinguish between meaningful and rote-learning outcomes. Student maps were also scored for evidence of conceptual richness and understanding. Finally, each map was compared directly with the content of the electronic teaching material. The results show that many of the student misconceptions were put right in the course of their learning but that many of the key concepts introduced in the teaching were ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote) by the students. This was because the teaching material locked these new ideas in structures and terminology that precluded meaning-making among non-experts. Our data suggest that students' prior knowledge is a key determinant of meaningful learning. We suggest that this must be acknowledged if the design and use of electronic teaching material is also to be meaningful. Ultimately, measures of student learning are the only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching through technology. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The development of teaching in higher education towards a more learner-orientated model has been supported by the literature on individual learning differences and on learning styles in particular. This has contributed to the evolution of university pedagogy away from a medieval transmission model than runs counter to contemporary understanding of learning. However, rather than solving problems of classroom practice, recognition of student learning differences has amplified a number of tensions within the system that have not been adequately resolved in practical terms for academic staff. Such tensions complicate the professional lives of university teachers and as a consequence may lead to cycles of non-learning as teachers retreat towards the familiar transmission of content. A reconceptualisation of university pedagogy towards an expertise model allows the variation between complementary chains of practice and networks of understanding to be exploited as a positive characteristic of the learning experience.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss how students enrolled in a conceptual physics class for future elementary school teachers progress through the CoMPASS (Concept Map Project-based Activity Scaffolding System) curriculum for inclined planes. The curriculum challenges students to design the best inclined plane to lift a pool table into a van. We have found that students typically predict the correct type of board (long and smooth) to complete the challenge, but their responses include evidence of both physics and everyday reasoning. After working through the materials, the majority of students understand the relationship between distance and force in the inclined plane as well as why the inclined plane is useful to lift heavy objects. However, students have difficulty both relating a plane’s steepness to the force required to pull an object and discussing work in a scientifically correct manner. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Despite its importance as a central goal in environmental education, there appears to be little consensus about how best to document, assess and evaluate understanding of environmental concepts. This illustrative case study describes and demonstrates the use of the concept mapping strategy as an effective tool for assessing environmental understanding. Data were collected from 325 middle school-aged (11-14 years) individuals and comparisons were made among those enrolled in a model, university-based, informal, residential marine education program (viz. MarineQuest) and a matched group of non-participating students. Using a non-randomized Solomon Four Group experimental design, differences in the structural complexity and content validity of knowledge about marine animal life were explored. Results reveal significant differences in the frequencies of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branching and cross-linking and in the frequencies and types of critical concepts depicted. In all cases, where differences were found, they favored participants who enrolled in the environmental education intervention. The findings suggest that concept maps offer a valuable alternative or adjunct to traditional pencil and paper tests and provide both a qualitative and a quantitative measure of conceptual understanding.

AB  - There has recently been significant emphasis placed on environmental education through, for example, the UN's Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. Despite this, there is still considerable debate within the literature as to how the aims of environmental education can be achieved within schools. It seems likely that if there is a lack of agreement as to what education for sustainable development should include, then this will impact students' understanding of sustainable development. This paper presents findings from research investigating how one class of 12- to 13-year-old geography students in the UK understands the concept of sustainability. The research used concept-mapping and semi-structured interviews to explore the students' understandings of sustainability, within a case study framework. The substantive findings of this research suggest that there is a wide variety of understanding of sustainability among the students, but that generally they allude to three: the nature, purpose and timescale of sustainability. The paper also considers the impact of method on researching students' subject understandings, in particular the use of context when considering abstract concepts, such as sustainability, and the different results obtained when conducting interviews versus concept maps.

AB  - We investigated whether and how prior knowledge activation improves learning outcomes for high school (less experienced learners) and university students (experienced learners) in a hypertext environment. Map coherence was defined as the extent to which relationships between the concepts in the map were made explicit. Therefore, we classified the mapping task of creating and labelling lines as low-coherent, and the mapping task of labelling provided lines as high-coherent. Learners were randomly assigned to the conditions of (1) high-coherent knowledge activation; (2) low-coherent knowledge activation; and (3) a baseline condition without prior knowledge activation. We found an overall effect for prior knowledge activation, learning experience, and an interaction between learning experience and the coherence of the prior knowledge activation task on learning outcomes. High school students benefited most from labelling provided lines, while university physics majors benefited most from creating and labelling lines. This interaction effect and effects of the specific mapping tasks on process measures support the claim that different prior knowledge activation tasks are suited for different groups of learners.

AB  - This study was designed to theoretically articulate and empirically assess the role of computer scaffolds. In this project, several examples of educational software were developed to scaffold the learning of students performing high level cognitive activities. The software used in this study, Artemis, focused on scaffolding the learning of students as they performed information seeking activities. As 5th grade students traveled through a project-based science unit on photosynthesis, researchers used a pre-post design to test for both student motivation and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. To measure both variables, a motivation survey and three methods of concept map analysis were used. The student use of the scaffolding features was determined using a database that tracked students’ movement between scaffolding tools. The gain scores of each dependent variable was then correlated to the students’ feature use (time and hits) embedded in the Artemis Interface. This provided the researchers with significant relationships between the scaffolding features represented in the software and student motivation and conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. There were a total of three significant correlations in comparing the scaffolding use by hits (clicked on) with the dependent variables and only one significant correlation when comparing the scaffold use in time. The first significant correlation ( r = .499, p < .05) was between the saving/viewing features hits and the students’ task value. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the saving/viewing features and the students’ perception of how interesting, how important, and how useful the task is. The second significant correlation ( r = 0.553, p < 0.01) was between the searching features hits and the students’ self-efficacy for learning and performance. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the searching features and the students’ perception of their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task. The third significant correlation ( r = 0.519, p < 0.05) was between the collaborative features hits and the students’ essay performance scores. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the collaborative features and the students’ ability to perform high cognitive tasks. Finally, the last significant correlation ( r = 0.576, p < 0.01) was between the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the maintenance features and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis.

AB  - A study examined students' understanding of the particulate nature of matter and chemical bonding to determine possible relationships between students' understandings of these two concepts.  A two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument was administered to 260 Grades 9 and 10 students from a secondary school in Singapore.  Results showed several alternative conceptions about the two concepts and indicated that students' limited understanding of the particulate nature of matter had an influence on their understanding of chemical bonding.  These results present information that can be used to challenge students' alternative conceptions regarding the particulate nature of matter during classroom instruction, thereby leading to better understanding of chemical bonding.

AB  - This study investigates how peer assessment can help students to learn about photosynthesis in a ‘high attaining’, year nine class in a UK 11-18 comprehensive school. There is limited research on how peer assessment can influence the learning of ‘high attaining students’; most existing research focuses on how formative assessment can benefit learning and self-esteem in low-attaining students or those with learning disabilities (Black and Wiliam, 1998a). A conceptually demanding topic like photosynthesis provides an excellent context to examine how peer assessment can impact on the learning of high attaining students. Analysis of data derived from questionnaires, individual interviews and conventional tests suggested that (1) a six week multi-component peer assessment intervention can have an impact on students' learning, and (2) some of the effect on learning may be linked to the way in which peer assessment enhanced students' own understanding of the role they play in their learning, and hence their autonomy in learning.

AB  - A study investigated how secondary students, who were assigned to be earth science mentors in a three-tiered program, presented a tested curriculum on climate change to 7th graders from a local feeder school.  Nine 11th and 12th graders from a large urban high school participated in this study.  During Tier I, 11th and 12th graders learned a tested curriculum on climate change and were prepared to be mentors with the help of university-based scientists, science educators, and secondary science teachers.  Before Tier I, four scientists involved in climate change research independently derived a list of concepts that they viewed to be the focus of this topic.  Concept maps and interviews were used to evaluate student understandings.  A benchmark of 11th and 12th graders' understandings of climate change was established.  Suggestions were formulated as to how these results can inform instructional practices in the geosciences.

AB  - Commercial computer games contain "physics engine" components, responsible for providing realistic interactions among game objects. The question naturally arises of whether these engines can be used to develop educational materials for high school and university physics education. To answer this question, the author's group recently conducted a detailed scientific investigation of the physics engine of Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004). This article presents their motivation, methodology, and results. The author presents the findings of experiments that probed the accessibility and fidelity of UT2004's physics engine, examples of educational materials developed, and an evaluation of their use in high school classes. The associated pedagogical implications of this approach are discussed, and the author suggests guidelines for educators on how to deploy the approach. Key resources are presented on an associated Web site. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine whether or not the construction of concept maps by students improves their achievement and ability to solve higher order questions in chemistry, (2) investigate the differential effect of the treatment by gender and achievement level, and (3) explore the relationships between performance on concept maps and chemistry achievement. Participants were 60 tenth-grade students randomly divided into two groups. The study spanned six weeks in a class that met five times a week. The material covered was acid-base titration and equilibrium in weak acids. The students were pre- and post-tested using a teacher-constructed chemistry test. Results showed that while there were no significant differences on the achievement total score, there were significant differences favoring the experimental group for scores on the knowledge level questions. Moreover, there were sex-achievement interactions at the knowledge and comprehension level questions favoring females and achievement level - achievement interactions favoring low achievers. Finally, there were significant correlations between students' scores on high level questions and the convergence and total concept map scores. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio. The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth's atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the 3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time). Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may reduce overall system access time: while higher math proficiency may predict retention scores.

AB  - The article focuses on teaching science through a systems approach, applied to the seventh-grade students of Woodrow Wilson Middle School. Here, the students are being familiarized with the concept of system by discussing examples of engineering systems, natural systems, and social systems. The author elaborates that systems-thinking approach involves refocusing its understandings from objects to relationships, from contents to patterns, from structures to processes, from individuals communities, and from microcosms to macrocosms. The author expresses that thinking systematically enables the students to act as critical thinkers and to design intelligent solutions to everyday questions and problems.

AB  - Past practice has assumed a strong correspondence between concept maps and complementary text passages. To quantify and explore this correspondence, this investigation examines the average percent of agreement of multiple concept maps derived from one short text passage. Participants were 16 graduate-level students enrolled in a curriculum course. Participants worked in dyads to convert a 255-word text passage on the heart and circulatory system into a concept map of this content Propositions in the eight resulting concept maps were analyzed using Pathfinder KNOT software. The correspondence between the eight concept maps and the text passage were only fair to poor. However, for the three dyads with a science major as a member, these concept maps corresponded more with each other (e.g., 61%, 65%, and 87% agreement), and also with the text passage (e.g., 46%, 52%, and 55% agreement). Thus prior knowledge may be critical in concept mapping and likely relates to selecting the most important concepts to include from the universe of concepts and also knowing when the map is completed.

AB  - Relations between preservice teachers' guided field observations of primary literacy instruction and knowledge about effective beginning reading practices were explored. Preservice teachers (n = 48) participated in a Directed Field Experience course including instruction on and observations of exemplary teaching practices promoting student engagement and literacy achievement. Correlations, calculated between the quantity of exemplary reading instruction practices observed by preservice teachers and the accuracy of observations with their knowledge about effective beginning literacy instruction, suggest guided field observations of exemplary practices may positively impact preservice teachers' knowledge of effective early literacy instruction. Observing more exemplary practices was associated with preservice teachers' knowledge acquisition represented in concept maps (r = .368; p = .015). Practices promoting a generally motivating classroom atmosphere were more readily understood by preservice teachers than intricate subtleties of motivating literacy instruction.

AB  - Although collaborative group work is used by many instructors as a useful educational tool, there is much room for research on how learning actually occurs within collaborative learning environments. This paper attempts to explore the relationship(if any) between task structure and collaborative group interactions in a synchronous peer interaction collaborative learning environment. For this reason, we used the Cmap during a Physics course for Grade 12 students. This paper compares two groups of students, one studying concept maps with single answer task, and the other studying concept maps with variable answer task. The aim of the study presented in this article is to also investigate the influence of task structure on students’ interactivity according to certain indicators and cognitive performance.

AB  - Background: Concept maps developed as teaching tools by Novak et al. depending on Ausubel's cognitive learning theory display the relationships and hierarchy between the concepts. Concept maps, having been used mostly as teaching tools, display the relationships between the concepts concretely and therefore are qualified to be utilized as an alternative evaluation tool in terms of research on students' cognitive structures. Purpose: This study aims to determine the cognitive structures of secondary level students regarding electric current through the concept mapping technique. Programme description: First, an activity was conducted with the students, which aimed to inform the students about concept mapping during a lesson hour. Then, students were given 26 concepts related to electric current and were asked to create their concept maps. The conceptual structures of students were determined through the examination of their concept maps via the descriptive statistical methods. Sample: The research was conducted with a total of 244 (119 female - 125 male) students aged between 15 and 17, who attend Year 12 in eight different secondary schools in Ankara within the 2003-2004 academic year. Design and methods: This research is a qualitative study that uses concept mapping technique to determine the students' conceptions of secondary level students related to electric current. The conceptual structures of students were determined through the examination of their concept maps via the descriptive statistical methods. As the data collection tool, the concept maps created by the students as well as the semi-structured and structured interviews with 20% of each class were utilized. Moreover, all students interviewed also experienced a structured interview where two simple electric circuits consisting of a battery, resistance and electric bulb were discussed. The obtained responses were analyzed under separate categories. Results: The research concluded that students had various alternative conceptions regarding electric current. Some of these alternative conceptions held by the students were found to be different from the ones in the literature. "Electric current is stored in the generator.", "Electric current moves in the opposite direction of (-) load" and "Electric current is spent at the resistances" represent some of the misconceptions of the students. Conclusions: With the help of the concept maps, the alternative concepts in the conceptual structures of the students could also be determined. As in this study, concept maps provide the determination of alternative conceptions that were already thought to be held by the students, as well as different alternative conceptions.

AB  - We previously reported how the opinions of second-year dentistry students and faculty members can be used to construct an assessment rubric to grade group-based concept maps in physiology (14). This article describes the second phase of this study of the subsequent year's cohort. A case study approach was used to investigate how groups of students used the criteria to complete their complex concept maps. Students' opinions about the assessment task and newly constructed rubric were sampled. Opinions across groups were correlated to academic achievements in the course. Two groups of four students volunteered to be videorecorded during a 4-h workshop, during which they completed their maps. The mapping task was not generally favored by students. However, those students who did favor the task achieved higher academic grades. Most students favored the newly constructed assessment rubric, commenting that it was easy to understand, fair, and appropriate, but reported that extra guidance from tutors and other resources were required. Coded videorecordings of the two observation groups revealed complex interactions around the three criteria of content, logic and understanding, and presentation. Two broad patterns of working were identified. One group distributed their efforts more evenly across the criteria, whereas the other group completed their maps by addressing the criteria in stages. These findings clearly indicate the academic challenges and social complexity in how students work in groups to complete complex concept maps in physiology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, the authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing the inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between the concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Although researchers in higher education propose alternatives to traditional approaches to assessment, traditional methods are commonly used in college or university science courses. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and validity of Prospective Science Teachers’ (PSTs) concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach to describe the changes in the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in general chemistry laboratory investigations. After the PSTs ( n = 47) decided on important issues, such as who would assess their concept maps and what scoring strategy and criteria would be used, they practiced assessing their own and peers’ concept maps during the first five laboratory investigations. They subsequently constructed and assessed pre- and post-laboratory concept maps in a student-centred approach consisting of self, peer, and instructor assessments for the five remaining laboratory investigations. The results of the study showed using pre- and post-laboratory concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach was valid and reliable for describing the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in a university general chemistry laboratory course. The results of individual interviews indicated most PSTs had positive views of their assessment practices in the laboratory course. This study also provides pedagogical implications for the training of science teachers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many classroom teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers' beliefs, stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool may have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards' vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could be characterized in three ways: coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs about the connections of concepts within science.

AB  - A study examined the impact of teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches on the process of students' conceptual change as two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan learned about the seasons in a technologically enhanced environment.  Findings revealed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the technologically-enhanced learning course; in this technologically-enhanced environment, the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change; and the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students reexamine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change.

AB  - This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the 'paper & pencil' concept mapping technique and the computer-supported educational environment 'ModelsCreator'. Students' shared activity in both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and also identify the activity's similar and different aspects in each one. Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of which concerns the process of collaboratively creating a plant growth model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process has been derived within the theoretical framework of 'activity theory' on the basis of the OCAF scheme for basic modeling operations and the scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (1998). Secondary students' dynamic modeling processes: analyzing, reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 7(3), 215-234.] for higher-order modeling actions. According to our results, four major modeling actions (analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of modeling operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed.

AB  - Bioinformatics research requires input from several different domains, but the majority of bioinformatics learners are unfamiliar with specific biological issues. We propose an approach that combines problem-based learning and concept map methodology to realize and construct the biological problems. As part of the problem-solving process, learners must gather materials and identify essential knowledge-thus creating a scenario conducive to learner training. We believe this approach will be of great use to non-biologist learners in the bioinformatics field. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to describe the changes in one student's ideas about force and one-dimensional motion concepts and portray the relevant metaconceptual processes that she engaged in during the implementation of metaconceptual teaching interventions. Metaconceptual processes involves metacognitive processes that are directly acting on or related to individuals' conceptions, mental models or elements of their conceptual ecology. Several types of instructional activities including poster drawing, concept mapping, group debate, journal writing and group and class discussions were used to activate students' metaconceptual processes. The findings of the study indicated that the student changed all of her alternative ideas that were assessed before the instruction with scientifically accepted conceptions following the instruction. The findings also showed that the student engaged in several types of metaconceptual processes ranging from simple awareness of ideas to more sophisticated metaconceptual processes, such as metaconceptual monitoring and evaluation. The findings strengthen the claims about the positive impact of metaconceptual processes on changing students' conceptions of physical world. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Diagrams that summarize the links between the subjects usually taught in the first semester of a general chemistry course are presented.  Generally, students find it easier to learn a set of related concepts than to learn a set of isolated concepts.  To facilitate this process, the course material in first-semester general chemistry can be organized into 2 concept maps that cover structure and properties and quantitative chemical relationships, respectively.  These diagrams can be used to illustrate to students how a particular topic relates to the other material in the course and how the class material for a specific day fits into the overall course.

AB  - Curriculum design is a concern in European Universities as they face the forthcoming European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This process can be eased by the use of scientific tools such as Concept-Mapping Techniques (CMT) that extract and organize the most relevant information from experts’ experience using statistics techniques, and helps a working group to achieve conclusions. This paper presents an empirical exploratory research study related to the application of the CMT to the design of the Electronic Engineering (EE) Degree at the University of Seville, Spain. Considering the Career-space conclusions as the initial point, the main relevant competences were identified in a brainstorming technique. These competences are organized according to their affinity using CMT, establishing and interpreting the main clusters and their relative importance. Finally, a reliability analysis of the concept maps was carried out verifying the correctness of the procedure and validating the results for the curricula adaptation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article reports the findings of Phase II of our study of student use of web-based tutorial materials for general chemistry and student understanding of chemistry concepts. We have found that students who use the web site valued the aspects of visualization of chemistry concepts and availability of materials online. In our analysis of student understanding of chemistry concepts by way of concept maps, we found that students who used the web site showed a similar level of understanding of chemistry to that of the students who did not use the web site, but that the web site users attempted to make more concept map links about the relevant chemistry concepts. Similarly to our finding in Phase I of the study, most students thought a the Web was a good way to get help learning chemistry. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who independently used their study time. The findings revealed that individually generating concept maps on computers during study time positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept maps on computers for learning.

AB  - This paper assesses the usefulness of concept mapping (an educational learning, assessment, and curriculum development technique developed by Novak, widely used in the natural sciences) within an accounting education context. It shows how an accounting-based concept map can be constructed by students and educators to provide a visual, conceptually transparent graphical representation of an individual's understanding of a particular knowledge domain. The method is firmly routed in Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning and its emphasis upon the hierarchical structure of concepts is particularly relevant to accounting. While concept mapping has been used extensively in many (particularly science) disciplines, it has received relatively little attention within accounting education. The paper's contribution is to extend its application within an accounting education context by focusing upon how concept mapping can enhance students' learning by evaluating student-prepared concept maps, showing how concept mapping can be used at different levels within a course (i.e. curriculum, topic and activity) and reporting feedback of its use with two cohorts of students, within a financial accounting theory component. The use of educator-prepared concept maps, with concepts omitted, proved popular as tutorial quiz exercises and increased the quantity and quality of participation. However, students were less willing to construct their own concept maps and engage in meaningful learning. While most students were able to build upon aspects of their prior knowledge, stronger students used a greater range of concepts, a richer set of linkages and more examples than weaker students did. Concept maps were useful in diagnosing students' and instructors' misconceptions. Many students found concept mapping relatively easy to use, provided a better understanding of complex issues, liked the visual representation and holistic view, and so supported their learning. However, educators need to become proficient in constructing maps and using appropriate software, not make the maps too complex, provide students with some initial training in the technique and consider the fit between using the techniques as a learning tool and as an assessment tool. While no significant differences were found in the usefulness of the method for students of different ages and gender, Asian students generally found the method to be more useful than did UK students.

AB  - Pupils with autism often present significant challenges to teachers. They seem to have real strengths in visual processing but a cognitive style that encourages them to focus on detail rather than the overarching connections between concepts. Veronica Roberts, currently undertaking doctoral training at the Institute of Education, University of London, in order to become an educational psychologist, and Richard Joiner, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, set out to explore these issues. In this article, they report the outcomes of a naturalistic experiment in which they investigated the utility of concept mapping as an educational strategy with pupils diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Theoretical arguments supporting the use of concept mapping with an autistic population are outlined in the paper. A tutor group of ten pupils with ASD, aged between 11 and 14 years, took part in the study. Concept mapping tasks were integrated within National Curriculum science lessons in collaboration with the school's science teacher. The study found that the increase in pupil performance in subject-specific questionnaires was nearly four times greater in the concept mapping condition than after a more conventional teaching intervention. Veronica Roberts and Richard Joiner tentatively draw out the implications of their work for staff who work with pupils with ASD and make recommendations for further research into the use of these learning strategies.

AB  - The article discusses the concept-mapping approach of William Trochim that stresses the significance of educational program and curriculum management toward faculty consensus. This structured group approach is used in arriving at a consensus on learning goals and objectives. It is a mixed-method technique that changes qualitative perceptions of similarity and value into statistical and optical representations of the conceptual domain and is used in public policy research. The authors note that concept-mapping approach assists academic administrators in handling the restructuring of curriculum and the improvement of faculty consensus.

AB  - Educational technologies have contributed greatly to the improvement of the process of education. Besides contributing to education directly, the development in new technologies made it almost compulsory to bring new approaches in teaching methods. Among these contributions can be mentioned the application of Internet Technologies in teaching. There is an ever-increasing positive impact on learning of combining technological materials with teaching methods, or using them as teaching materials. Electronic concept mapping can be considered as a teaching method to raise motivation and meaningfulness with its features being contextual, visual, multi-dimensional and interactive. Concept maps are of significant structure in language teaching because of their cognitive complexity, coherence and taxonomic organization. As concepts are contextual in English, this will create an appropriate atmosphere for it to be learnt together with its phonetic and linguistic structure. In this study a model of e-concept maps has been used as an alternative teaching method. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Emerging from a human constructivist view of learning and a punctuated model of conceptual change, these studies explored differences in the structural complexity and content validity of knowledge about prehistoric life depicted in concept maps by learners ranging in age from approximately 10 to 20 years. Study 1 (cross-age) explored the frequencies of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branching, and cross-links in concept maps drawn by students in grades 5, 8, 11, 13, and 14. The results provide some support for a punctuated model of conceptual change. Study 2 (longitudinal) explored the same frequencies on repeated occasions among students enrolled in a college course on prehistoric life, and documented the shift in frequencies of "novice" and "expert" concepts occurring during the semester. The results suggest that college students engage in much restructuring of their knowledge frameworks during the period of a semester. Together, the two studies raise questions about common classroom practices that encourage the rote learning of biology and geology concepts at all levels. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use concept maps as an ‘expressed model’ to investigate students' mental models regarding the homeostasis of blood sugar. The difficulties in learning the concept of homeostasis and in probing mental models have been revealed in many studies. Homeostasis of blood sugar is one of the themes in junior high school biology in Taiwan. However, few studies have investigated it. Here, semi-structured interviews were conducted together with concept mapping to explore students' mental models. There were 14 students, 7th-and 9th-graders, in this study. From the results, both groups were shown to lack a concept of the nervous system. However, 7th-graders did have more developed concepts of the endocrine and digestive systems. The data also indicated that students used external behaviours or life experiences to explain the mechanism responsible for the homeostasis of blood sugar, but did not possess a de-tailed view of the components of the mechanism. The implications, and recommendations for pedagogy, are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Nursing theory challenges students to think abstractly and is often a difficult introduction to graduate study. Traditionally, concept analysis is useful in facilitating this abstract thinking. Concept maps are a way to visualize an individual's knowledge about a specific topic. Serial concept maps express the sequential evolution of a student's perceptions of a selected concept. Maps reveal individual differences in learning and perceptions, as well as progress in understanding the concept. Relationships are assessed and suggestions are made during serial mapping, which actively engages the students and faculty in dialogue that leads to increased understanding of the link between nursing theory and practice. Serial concept mapping lends itself well to both online and traditional classroom environments. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Concept mapping is a teaching and learning tool that is especially suited for science-based instruction. This article describes concept mapping as a tool for course evaluation in a fourth-year undergraduate Wellness course in a Health Studies Department. Pre-lecture and post-lecture concept maps describing wellness were compared on the basis of the degree of complexity of the diagram and the relationships among the various parameters. The post-lecture maps showed significantly more detail than did the pre-lecture maps, and the complexity of the post-lecture maps provided evidence that the students had a clearer understanding of all wellness parameters. Compared with a traditional course survey, this method detailed what information was important to students in their understanding of the course material and provided meaningful feedback on material that required greater emphasis in the course. Further research into the use of concept mapping to refine evaluative criteria and provide effective teaching is recommended. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This study examined the use of concept map technique as a diagnostic and instructional tool in an introductory cell biology course. The course consists of lectures and discussion sessions (in nine parallel groups). So far the study has been running for two consecutive years. In the first year, we arbitrarily selected four groups, and they made up the experimental group. Students in this group (118) were asked to individually build a concept map from a list of twenty concepts, after which the TA used these maps as instruction tools. In the control group, the TA presented the same concepts in a lecture format. Though we did not find significant differences between the groups in terms of student achievement, the concept map technique was found to be useful for the students and for the TAs and enlightening for the course instructor In the second year, we implemented instruction with the concept map technique in five discussion sessions for all the nine groups, and the instructor summarized each topic with his own concept map. The feedback we received from the students (154) supports using the combination of students' maps with instructor maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article considers the impact of the early stages of an international project, Gardens for Life (GfL), on children’s perceptions of school gardening and on their learning. The project involved 67 schools in England, Kenya and India and focused on the growing of crops, recognising the importance of both the process and product of this activity in the different countries. The theoretical framework was derived from consideration of informal learning, and more specifically experiential learning, drawing on prior research undertaken in the context of school gardening. The research approach is characterised by the use of concept maps to uncover the characteristically different ways in which children discerned school gardening and to help to provide insight into their understanding of this activity. It was supported by contextual observation, interviews and children’s drawings to aid the interpretation and understanding. The study showed a positive impact on learning and on the perceptions of children towards school gardening in all three countries. It also highlighted the different perceptions, interpretations and understanding of school gardening in the different cultures and environments, as well as the various aspects of it which the children themselves highlighted.

AB  - Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions that economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their science classes. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Change and complexity are creating a need for increasing levels of literacy in science and technology. Presently, we are beginning to provide students with clear contexts in which to learn, including clearly written text, visual displays and maps, and more effective instruction. We are also beginning to give students tools that promote their own literacy by helping them to interact with the learning context. These tools include peer-group skills as well as strategies to analyze text and to indicate comprehension by way of text summaries and concept maps. Even with these tools, more appears to be needed. Disparate backgrounds and languages interfere with the comprehension and the sharing of knowledge. To meet this need, two new tools are proposed. The first tool fractures language ontologically, giving all learners who use it a language to talk about what has, and what has not, been uttered in text or talk about the world. The second fractures language epistemologically, giving those involved in working with text or on the world around them a way to talk about what they have done and what remains to be done. Together, these tools operate as a two- tiered knowledge representation of knowledge. This representation promotes both an individual meta-cognitive and a social meta-cognitive approach to what is known and to what is not known, both ontologically and epistemologically. Two hypotheses guide the presentation: If the tools are taught during early childhood, children will be prepared to master science and technology content. If the tools are used by both students and those who design and deliver instruction, the learning of such content will be accelerated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article discusses the effect of blending both feedback and the generation of concept maps on learning terminology and learner comprehension. Two types of concept maps were investigated to find those instances in which there was a significant difference between test scores of learner generated concept map items versus those that were matched to researcher generated concept map items by students who used partially generated concept maps with feedback and those without feedback. The results discussed indicated that: (a) the use of concept mapping was not significantly different from those who did not use concept mapping on the criterion test scores; (b) those who did not receive feedback (totally generated and partially generated maps) did significantly better than those with feedback on the comprehension test score; (c) those working with the partially generated maps with feedback did significantly better on the terminology test score.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of using the cooperative concept mapping (CCM) teaching approach on secondary school students' motivation in biology. A non equivalent control group design under the quasi-experimental research was used in which a random sample of four co-educational secondary schools was used. The four schools were randomly assigned to four groups. Each school provided one Form Two class. The study sample comprised of 156 second grade students in the secondary school cycle (Form Two students) in Gucha District, Kenya. Students in all the groups were taught the same biology content but two groups, the experimental groups, were taught using the CCM approach while the other two, the control groups, were taught using regular teaching methods. Two groups, one experimental and one control, were pre-tested prior to the implementation of the CCM intervention. After four weeks, all four groups were post-tested using the students motivation questionnaire (SMQ). Data were analysed using the t-test, ANOVA and ANCOVA. The results show that students exposed to the CCM approach have significantly higher motivation than those taught through regular methods. The results further indicate that there is no statistically significant gender difference in motivation towards the learning of biology among secondary school students exposed to CCM. The researchers conclude that CCM is an effective teaching approach, which biology teachers need to incorporate in their teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper reports on a study of ecology teaching and learning in a Swedish primary school class (age 10-11yrs). A teaching sequence was designed to help students read nature in a river ecosystem. The teaching sequence had a ‘bottom up’ approach, taking as its starting point a common key organism—the freshwater shrimp. From this species and its ecology, the perspective was broadened to involve studies of the interrelations between organisms and finally to the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors. A large part of the instruction took place outdoors. Students were interviewed three times during the course when they were presented with a tray full of objects (both biotic and abiotic) from the ecosystem. The students' task was to name and describe the objects and then to link them up in as many relevant ways as possible, explaining the reasons for the links. The interviews have been transcribed onto concept maps and SOLO-taxonomy was used to illustrate their developing ecological understanding. Results indicate how students related several abstract processes and correlations back to the key organism studied early in the teaching sequence. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The article discusses concept maps, a teaching tool, and ways to make them more effective. The study consisted of three separate experiments. Each experiment examined one of the following factors and its effect on dynamic thinking: cyclic versus hierarchical map structures, concept quantification, and focus question. A cyclic map structure, a quantified header concept, and the focus question "how" produced the best dynamic thinking. The authors note that dynamic thinking represents the functional interdependency between two concepts.

AB  - Three experiments were conducted to examine the effects of map structure, concept quantification, and focus question on dynamic thinking during a Concept Map (CMap) construction task. The first experiment compared cyclic and hierarchical structures. The second experiment examined the impact of the quantification of the header concept in the map. The third experiment explored the effect of the focus question on the map. For all three experiments, the content of the CMaps was assessed for the number of dynamic propositions and the number of quantified concepts. The results show that the cyclic structure, the quantification of the header concept, and the focus question “How” significantly increased dynamic thinking. The studies, the theoretical background, and the implications of the findings are discussed. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore teachers’ growth in understanding of algebra using concept maps. The study was set in the context of a five-year National Science Foundation funded teacher retention and renewal professional development project. In this project both beginning and experienced teachers are supported as they increase their understanding about mathematics, their ability to implement effective mathematics practices in their classrooms, and their knowledge of working with English Learners. Results indicate that teachers’ algebraic knowledge structures became more complex and connected as a result of their professional development. In addition, they were able to adapt their knowledge networks to incorporate important aspects of algebra into them. Concept maps are recommended to other leaders of mathematics professional development as a means of assessing change. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Web-based learning has been proposed as a convenient way to provide professional development experiences. Despite quantitative evidence that online instruction is equivalent to traditional methods (Russell, 2001), the efficiency of this approach has not been extensively studied among teachers. This case report describes learning in an online biology course designed to help teachers prepare for science certification exams. A mixed methodology approach was utilized to analyze the manner in which course participants learned and how the online environment influenced this process. Concept maps scored by two different methods and objective pre- and postcourse examinations were contrasted as representations of assimilated knowledge, while unstructured interviews reflected participants' perceptions of their experiences. Findings indicate that participants experienced gains in declarative knowledge, but little improvement with respect to more complex levels of understanding. Qualitative examination of concept maps demonstrated gaps in participants' understandings of key course ideas. Engagement in the use of online resources varied according to participants' attitudes toward online learning. Subjects also reported a lack of motivation to fully engage in the course due to busy schedules, lack of extrinsic rewards, and the absence of personal accountability. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The derivative is not only an important subject for mathematics but also is an important subject for engineering, physics, economy, chemistry, and statistics. Especially, mathematics depends on strongly preceding learning and the subject of derivative will be used in university education by all students. Therefore, it is one of the most important subjects. This study's purpose is to explore student mistakes and errors in derivative and determine the areas in which students have probable misconceptions. For this purpose, 7 questions were chosen from "the Student Placement Test" (OSS). These questions were transferred into open-ended questions. The results of the study took place at sixth form college are described and discussed. The test administered to 53 students from Balikesir Fatma Emin Kutvar Anatolian High School in the fall-term of 2005-2006. Determining the possible misconceptions should help teachers when they teach this subject. The study findings showed that students could not understand derivative definition that depends on limit, make mistakes in composite functions and trigonometric functions, and establish wrong relations between tangent's slope, and normal's slope. Teachers need to be able to find errors and misconceptions in students' solutions. Teachers also need to be applying meaningful learning strategies such as concept maps, worksheets about derivative (e.g. Appendix B, Appendix C). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20 multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test. The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Students bring prior knowledge to their learning experiences. This prior knowledge is known to affect how students encode and later retrieve new information learned. Teachers and content developers can use information about students' prior knowledge to create more effective lessons and materials. In many content areas, particularly the sciences, there is extensive research about the conceptions and misconceptions students bring to the learning environment. This research has used tools ranging from instructor and student interviews to written assessments to identify these ideas. In addition, concept maps have been explored as a way to understand how students relate different concepts to each other. A difficulty with concept maps is that there are not good solutions for studying larger groups of students, but also maintaining the detail to see how specific concepts are related. One way to address this is with similarity ratings and the use of the Pathfinder network program. Although there are some areas in which a large amount is known about students' knowledge, there is little understanding of either student or instructor knowledge in the field of computer networking. This paper is a preliminary attempt to explore the knowledge structures of students entering a computer networking class and their instructors using the Pathfinder network methodology. The study participants consisted of 156 students and 12 teachers in 12 different classes, each at a different institution. All of the students were enrolled in the first course (Cisco Certified Networking Associate 1) in the Cisco Networking Academy Program. Students and instructors rated the similarity between pairs of words that represented concepts covered in the course prior to beginning instruction in the course. There were two different groups of words, one representing the course as a whole and one representing a specific chapter. The similarity ratings for these terms were submitted to Pathfinder network analysis, creating both average concept maps for students and instructors as well as measures of the similarity between the maps. Analysis of the maps revealed an instructor map that corresponded to the OSI model, a model of networking. The corresponding student map indicated students did not have this conceptualization of how the theoretical layers of the model work. Instead, students tended to link things that might generalize as equipment, and words that sounded similar. This linking of equipment was further demonstrated in the analysis of concepts from the chapter that introduces basic networking concepts. Whereas instructors exhibited an organization by network type (local or wide-area), the students displayed an equipment-centric organization. The instructor networks provide initial information about how experts organize knowledge in this relatively young field. By understanding some of the ways that students understand concepts prior to instruction, teachers should be better able to focus and tailor instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is now an established method in undergraduate medical education that aims to develop reasoning skills based on clinical problems. More recently, the use of concept mapping in medical education aims to improve meaningful learning. At the New University of Lisbon, we have been using PBL as a major educational method in a pathophysiology course. In 2003–2004, we started to use Inspiration, a computer-based concept mapping tool, with a single tutorial PBL group. A total of 36 maps were constructed related to short cases, already used in the PBL course, in which a certain number of key nodes were hidden to allow the students to fill in the gaps. The results obtained appear to indicate that the use of concept maps stimulated meaningful learning within a PBL course. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introductory tertiary level science classes (i.e., at the university or post-compulsory school level) including those for biology face increasing diversity in intake. Previous research has indicated university level teachers assume a certain level of prior knowledge which may or may not be possessed by such students. This report focuses on the use of concept mapping in introductory biology tutorial classes. The research findings suggest that the students found the use of concept mapping enjoyable and that it can enhance meaningful learning for topics that require students to link concepts.

AB  - This paper describes an ongoing study on the use of concept maps in an upper-division chemical engineering laboratory to enhance student learning. The Unit Operations Laboratory was chosen for the study since it is a comprehensive laboratory in which students are required to be familiar with various aspects of chemical engineering practice. The study was implemented in three stages. In the first stage the students were introduced to the idea and construction of concept maps. The second stage involved the construction of concept maps during a pre-lab session in which the students were orally tested about the exercise they were about to undertake. The last stage was the submission of the final reports in which the students were again required to hand in other concept maps. The students completed the lab practice in groups of three to four, and were asked to create both individual as well as collective concept maps. The present study produced three tentative findings. First, the first stage mainly produced simple concept maps that barely contained basic chemical engineering principles. These initial maps, however, developed and became more complicated as the students went on completing the lab practice and subsequently preparing the report. Secondly, it appears that each student wanted his/her contribution in the collective concept map construction to be acknowledged. Thus, the students were believed to be motivated. Thirdly, since the concept maps produced were collected and displayed in the lab for comparison with the subsequent lab sessions, the students seemed to get a feeling of continuity, something that is not normally noticeable in the traditional lab practice. These findings indicate that concept mapping has a positive effect on student learning. The paper ends with a discussion on the study with respect to its pedagogical values and applicability to other courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Nowadays the European Universities are worried about how to adapt higher education to the new European Higher Education Area, as proposed in the Bologna Magna Charta Universitatum of 1998, and signed by 32 European Education Ministers. One of the key points in this higher education reform was the introduction of new Master’s level curricula. These Masters will look for the professional specialization and they will have to be adapted to the specific skills demanded by the society. This paper presents the results from a cooperation project – funded by the AECI (International Cooperation Spanish Agency) and developed between the University of Seville (Spain) and the Catholic University of Asuncion (Paraguay) – by about the planning of a new master’s level curriculum in digital signal processing (DSP) area, taking into account the Bologna principles and the conclusions obtained by the Career Space Consortium. A scientific method from social science, known as concept mapping techniques, was used to perform this planning. Basically, the idea of concept mapping consists of compiling the opinion from actors belonging to different environments (lecturers, researchers, workers, businessmen, etc.) related to DSP applications. The compiled data were statistically computed to cluster the opinions of the different agents. The result will be a master’s level curricula adapted to the environment requirements and the social settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using a survey and follow-up qualitative research design, an elaborate model of technology integration has been studied in a science education classroom. Using a coding system known as cognotes, teacher-interns were first taught how to recognize electronic discussion contributions consisting specifically of critical approaches such as compare, contrast, cause and effect, inductive and deductive reasoning. An electronic concept map outlining the instructor's consideration of a contentious issue (creationism vs. evolution) was supplied to students. Students further developed concept maps (using Inspiration® software) in two ways: (a) students hyperlinked the individual concepts in their map to html-based learning logs and (b) students hyperlinked their own relational phrases between concepts to “captured” electronic discussions. The impact of the instructional approach was assessed through a survey of 68 students, standardized semi-structured interviews, and focus group methodology. Students were especially positive with regard to using a two-dimensional hyperlinked graphic organizer to lend a framework to their understanding of a contentious issue in science education. With regard to electronic discussion, students identified improvements in (a) their ability to formulate arguments, (b) their ability to lead effective discussions, and (c) their ability to substantiate their conceptual frameworks. The technology-integration model described is generic in its application and could be used with a variety of content knowledge. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This investigation seeks to confirm a computer-based approach that can be used to score concept maps (Poindexter & Clariana, 2004) and then describes the concurrent criterion-related validity of these scores. Participants enrolled in two graduate courses (n=24) were asked to read about and research online the structure and function of the heart and circulatory system, to construct a concept map, and then to write a 250-word essay on this topic. Pathfinder and Latent Semantic Analysis approaches were used to analyze the data. Term agreement with an expert was significantly related to human-rater concept map scores (r 0.75). All of the computer-derived scores were significantly correlated to human-rater essay scores (maximum r = 0.83). These results indicate that automatically derived concept map scores can provide a relatively low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' science content knowledge.

AB  - The purpose of this project was to evaluate concept mapping as a clinical teaching-learning activity that reflects critical thinking by promoting identification of nonlinear relationships among the components of the nursing process. The sample involved 28 associate degree nursing students from one graduating class. Students completed one map each in the second and fourth semesters and two maps in the fifth semester, for a total of four concept maps. The students' learning activity was to create a concept map on a blank sheet of paper describing the clients' physiological and psychosocial needs and nursing care and the relationships among concepts. As students progressed through the curriculum, there was a steady increase in the mean scores and the average number of cross-links in their concept maps. Cross-links indicated students' ability to use nonlinear thinking to identify relationships among concepts. The results of this study support the use of concept maps as an effective teaching-learning activity and support concept mapping as an evidence-based nursing education strategy.

AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which students learned by constructing, modifying, or viewing node-link diagrams. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.

AB  - An exercise to help students understand the characteristics of life and how these relate to the life of an organism is presented. The investigation involves exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation phases in which students work in groups to define the characteristics of life in depth. This inquiry-based approach is innovative, rigorous, and—most of all—thought provoking. Upon completion of the exercise, concept maps produced by the students are evaluated by the teacher, and the students prepare a reflective essay about how the exercise changed their conception of life.

AB  - Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student-generated visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle school science concept learning. In a post-test-only-control-group design, scores were compared among a control-group (n=28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper (n=30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers (n=34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post-test than the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group's scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups indicating that visualization might interact with learner characteristics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The authors investigated the effectiveness of 3 types of self-regulated study guides at a highly competitive military academy. Cadets were asked to construct 6 sets of study guides for 8 separate graded tests. After examining the cadets' own preferences for constructing their study guides for the first quiz, cadets were instructed to construct 3 other types of study guides (outlines, matrix organizers, and concept maps) to help self-regulate study strategies for subsequent tests. Results show that matrix organizers and concept maps correspond to higher achievement on the application items, whereas outlines tended to provide the best study guide for the multiple choice factual items.

AB  - The study was set in the context of a 5-year National Science Foundation sponsored teacher retention and renewal professional development program in which both beginning and experienced teachers are supported in the profession as they increase their understanding about mathematics, their ability to implement effective mathematics practices in their classrooms and their knowledge of working with English Learners. Data were collected from twenty-six teachers in their first five years of teaching as they participated in a week-long summer institute. The mathematics theme for the week was statistics. Concept map data and responses to reflective prompts designed to elicit participant's understandings of statistics concepts were collected before and after the institute. Results showed that teachers' self-reported change indicated more complex and connected knowledge structures after the institute. These findings were reflected by the concept map measures. In addition pattern-matching techniques were used to show that participants were able to adapt their knowledge networks to incorporate important aspects of algebra into them. Concept maps are recommended to other leaders of mathematics professional development as a means of assessing areas of change in content knowledge, especially when the participants represent a wide array of mathematics backgrounds.

AB  - This article explores the synergy that can be created when concept-mapping techniques are used in collaboration with the construction of PowerPoint presentations to increase the richness of the learning experience. Some weaknesses of the typical PowerPoint format are highlighted with a description of how they can be overcome through a more considered approach to both the structure of the presentation and the design of supporting handouts that incorporate ideas taken from the literature on concept mapping. In combination, these complementary tools (concept maps and PowerPoint) might contribute to an epistemologically balanced teaching approach. Reflection upon the revealed diversity of students' views may contribute to lecturers' conceptions of teaching. The possibility of using this to generate an inclusive pedagogy of access within higher education is introduced. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Pre-prepared concept maps that organise knowledge in a non-linear fashion appeal to a variety of cognitive learning styles and may thus represent an educational tool that supports ‘teaching to all types’. However, another central cognitive factor, learning approach, may have a bearing on student take-up of this learning resource. Student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were therefore examined in relation to the principal learning orientations according to Duff's 30-item revised approaches to study inventory (RASI). Approximately one half of students (49.6&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.5%) reported pre-prepared concept maps to be useful to their learning ( n &ThickSpace;=&ThickSpace;121). When preferred learning approach was examined, derived from the highest RASI score per individual and excluding ties, 31.9&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.3%, 29.3&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.2% and 38.8&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.5% of students demonstrated a preference for the deep approach (DA), strategic approach (STA) and surface approach (SUA), respectively ( P &ThickSpace;>&ThickSpace;0.05, χ 2 goodness-of-fit test, n &ThickSpace;=&ThickSpace;116). There was a weak but statistically significant association between preferred learning approach identified by Duff's 30-item RASI and the self-reported usefulness of concept maps ( P &ThickSpace; [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Faculty efforts to measure outcomes in study abroad programs typically fall short of current expectations for measurable results and increased competencies. Part of the problem stems from the dual challenge of conducting rigorous, objective assessment of these programs without losing the rich, subjective meaning of the cultural experience for student growth and development. The concept mapping method developed by Trochim is a potentially powerful tool for overcoming this challenge, allowing evaluators to utilize qualitative and quantitative research designs simultaneously. This paper illustrates the use of the method in an American social work study abroad program based in Mexico. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigated the score exchangeability of concept maps with problem-solving essays. Of interest was whether sixth-grade students' concept maps predicted their scores on essay responses that used concept map content. Concept maps were hypothesized to be alternatives to performance assessments for content-area domain knowledge in science. Both special (n = 16) and general (n = 16) education students participated in a science unit that covered three ecosystem cycles: (a) the water cycle, (b) the nitrogen cycle, and (c) the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle. Assessment tasks required students to draw three concept maps and respond to two essay questions. Results showed that concept maps and essay tasks lacked consistent exchangeability. Findings indicated low predictive validity between map scores and essay scores and, thus, maps should not be considered alternative content-area domain assessments [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this paper, we describe the development of an Adaptive Learning Environment (ALE) that can be used to help students attain the knowledge and skills needed to become successful programmers. Such systems can be used to improve students' learning outcomes in introductory computer science (CS1) courses by providing each student with individualized learning experiences. InCITE is a concept-based Adaptive Learning Environment designed to complement traditional classroom instruction by allowing each individual learner to progress at his or her own pace. It uses a problem-based pedagogical strategy that allows users to learn by solving programming-related problems. We describe the development of the system and its potential use in support of classroom instruction for teaching introductory object-oriented programming. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A study examined the processes by which students come to understand criteria in a challenging concept mapping task.  The findings reinforced the commitment of faculty members to using group-constructed concept maps with criteria-based assessment rubrics, clearly demonstrated the importance of faculty members working together in all assessment stages, and reinforced the importance of using language that reflects the understandings of both faculty members and students.  The results were used to develop an assessment rubric designed to be more accessible to learners.

AB  - Constructing quality assessment rubrics can be challenging, especially when they are used for integrated, group-centered, applied learning. We describe a collaborative assessment task in which groups of second-year dentistry students developed a complex concept map. In groups of four, the students were given a written, simulated, medical history of a patient and required to construct a concept map illustrating relevant pathophysiological concepts and pharmacological interventions. This report describes a research project aimed at making educational goals of the task more explicit through investigating student and faculty member understandings of the criteria that might be used to assess the concept map. Information was gathered about the perceptions of students in relation to the learning goals associated with the task. These were compared with faculty member perceptions. The findings were used to develop an assessment rubric intended to be more accessible to learners. The new rubric used the language of both faculty members and students to more clearly represent expectations of each criterion and standard. This assessment rubric will be used in 2005 for the next phase of the project. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This revision activity is a chance for able pupils to demonstrate their understanding of the links between some of the ideas covered in the biology. It can also be viewed as a concept-mapping activity that is now finding their way into classroom teaching.

AB  - This study examined concept maps produced by personality psychology students as a function of different types of concept map instruction. The results indicated the number of quantitative items in the students' concept maps significantly increased from the pretest to the posttest, as would be expected over the course of an academic semester. More importantly, the type of instructions the students received at the pretest played a significant role in the number of cross links depicted in the maps at the posttest. I discuss the results in terms of the utility of instruction type when using concept maps in social science courses. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - A spreadsheet simulation of the orbits of satellites moving through an atmosphere of variable density is described.  Two spreadsheets are used, one containing density and temperature data for the lower 1,000 km of Earth's atmosphere and the other containing the orbit simulation.  A concept map is used to guide students in developing formulations that describe the motion of satellites in an atmosphere with exponentially varying density.  The students then produce temporal profiles of the altitude, velocity, energy, and drag force for a low-Earth-orbiting satellite.

AB  - In this paper, we present two studies designed to help students navigate effectively and learn from a hypertext system, CoMPASS. Our first study (N = 74) involved an analysis of students' navigation patterns to group them into clusters, using a k-means clustering technique. Based on this analysis, navigation patterns were grouped into four clusters, enabling us to understand the kinds of support that students needed. This formed the basis of our next study, in which we designed and implemented metanavigation support to help students navigate and learn science content. Support in the form of prompts was provided to one group (N = 58) while a second group (N = 58) with no support served as the comparison group. Our results suggest that students in the support group performed better on a concept-mapping task. Based on the results we provide suggestions for providing metacognitive support in hypertext systems. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The article examines the basic constructs of concept mapping within a wide body of literature from concept maps, cognitive psychology, perception, information systems, systems thinking, management, and philosophy of science. The result has been a view of knowledge and knowledge representation that is different from the commonly accepted view of Concept Maps (CMaps) as a graphical knowledge representation system. CMaps are appropriate for representing only static relationships between concepts. Cyclic CMaps, in which concepts are arranged in a cycle and continuously influence each other, are the appropriate means of representing dynamic relationships between concepts. There are two types of dynamic relationships and these indicate a quantitative relationship between concepts in the loop. This is different from the static links between concepts, which typically point to a qualitative relationship between concepts. Further, Cyclic CMaps provide contextual information, which may have implications for meaningful learning.

AB  - A task that challenges human biology students to connect physiological and anatomical principles to aspects of human function is described.  Measurements of physiological, anatomical, and biochemical attributes of male and female athletes reveal likely explanations for performance differences at the elite level of competition.  The student task involves unscrambling relevant information to explain trends in performance comparisons between male and female athletes in running and swimming.  Concept mapping, which has been confirmed to enhance analytical and integrative skills among students, can be used to clearly visualize a causal pathway.  The performance comparison strategy has been successfully used as the basis of a problem-based learning exercise in tertiary level physical education students.

The proposed method is based on concept-mapping techniques, which applies multivariate statistic analysis to summarize the experience and knowledge of teachers involved in basic DSP teaching. As a result, a set of teaching methodologies is obtained. This result, as well as other information obtained related to the relative importance of the concepts to be covered, has been used to program the course. Moreover, different teaching tools have been developed to implement the proposed teaching methodology. Finally, the reliability of the method has been compared with similar studies to validate the proposed methodology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In order to design information retrieval (IR) learning environments and instruction, it is important to explore learning outcomes of different pedagogical solutions. Learning outcomes have seldom been evaluated in IR instruction. The particular focus of this study is the assessment of learning outcomes in an experimental, but naturalistic, learning environment compared to more traditional instruction. The 57 participants of an introductory course on IR were selected for this study, and the analysis illustrates their learning outcomes regarding both conceptual change and development of IR skill. Concept mapping of student essays was used to analyze conceptual change and log-files of search exercises provided data for performance assessment. Students in the experimental learning environment changed their conceptions more regarding linguistic aspects of IR and paid more emphasis on planning and management of search process. Performance assessment indicates that anchored instruction and scaffolding with an instructional tool, the IR Game, with performance feedback enables students to construct queries with fewer semantic knowledge errors also in operational IR systems.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping instruction, compared to traditional instruction (TI), on 8th grade students' understanding of solution concepts and their attitudes toward science as a school subject. Solution Concept Test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administered to a total of 64 eighth grade students from two classes of a general science course, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group received the conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping in a lecture by the teacher. This instruction explicitly dealt with students' misconceptions. It was designed to suggest conditions in which misconceptions could be replaced by scientific conceptions and new conceptions could be integrated with existing conceptions. The control group received TI in which the teacher provided instruction through lecture and discussion methods. The results showed that conceptual change text accompanied with concept mapping instruction caused a significantly better acquisition of scientific conceptions related to solution concept and produced significantly higher positive attitudes toward science as a school subject than the TI. In addition, logical thinking ability and prior learning were strong predictors for the concept learning related to solution. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - These studies identified key concepts and developmental differences in people's conceptions of the engineering design process. The method of assessment was concept mapping. Key concepts were derived from the concept maps of 15 experts and organized into six broad categories. Expert data served as benchmarks for assessing the conceptual development of 32 undergraduates who constructed individual maps at the beginning and end of a year-long design course. In general, students' conceptions tended to be more narrow, with consistently fewer references to larger societal issues such as ethics and marketing. Over time the expert--student gap closed regarding knowledge of the design process and the motivations underlying a design (e.g. customer need, scientific need). Findings suggest that an important difference between experts and students is that experts are more likely to situate the design process in a sociocultural context. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article describes the outcome of an exercise carried out with one hundred undergraduate student teachers (preservice teachers) enrolled in a Biology Teaching Methods course, a third year course in a four-year Teacher Education Programme. The students, working in groups of three to four, were assigned to construct a concept map showing their understanding of a part of the Form Four (grade ten) biology syllabus/curriculum offered in the Malaysian Secondary School System. The concept maps were derived from materials taken from the syllabus, and consisted of scientific concepts as well as the scientific skills and values associated with the chapters and their relationships. The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize the students with the syllabus and to make them understand the scope of the syllabus itself so that these preservice teachers would know what to focus on when they actually teach in the classroom. Through this exercise, not only the students' understanding of the syllabus was revealed but misconceptions among the students on the syllabus and the concept of scientific skills and values were also detected.

AB  - This article reports the results of an investigation of the convergent criterion-related validity of two computer-based tools for scoring concept maps and essays as part of the ongoing formative evaluation of these tools. In pairs, participants researched a science topic online and created a concept map of the topic. Later, participants individually wrote a short essay from their concept map. The concept maps and essays were scored by the computer-based tools and by human raters using rubrics. Computer-based concept map scores were a very good measure of the qualitative aspects of the concept maps (r= 0.84) and were an adequate measure of the quantitative aspects (r = 0.65). Also, the computer-based essay scores were an adequate measure of essay content (r = 0.71). If computer-based approaches for scoring concept maps and essays can provide a valid, low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' content knowledge, then these approaches will likely gain rapid acceptance by teachers at all levels.

AB  - A study examined the extent to which undergraduate students restructure their conceptual knowledge at progressively more sophisticated levels over the course of a two-semester lecture-based physical geology sequence.  Findings indicated that the course did not address the integration of concepts into student knowledge domains, with concept maps and clinical interviews both illustrating the acquisition of geologic concepts longitudinally with a disproportionately small increase in the integration of those concepts into frameworks of understanding.  However, results suggest that concept maps and clinical interviews seem to be viable and complementary approaches in determining the degree to which student accomplishment objectives are being met.

AB  - The ability to use the research literature within a given field is a basic skill that students should acquire as part of their higher education studies. However, undergraduates need support in developing this skill. The use of concept maps as an aid to interrogating the literature is described here. This may help students to highlight key issues raised within a research paper, and may be used to demonstrate understanding to their tutors. An example is given by reference to the paper in which James Watson and Francis Crick suggest a structure for DNA. In this, annotated concept maps are used to highlight key issues from the paper from two perspectives: the race to describe the structure of DNA, and the biochemistry of the molecule.

AB  - This paper describes the methods and outcomes of a 12-year longitudinal study into the effects of an early intervention program, while reflecting back on changes that have occurred in approaches to research, learning and instruction since the preliminary inception stages of the study in the mid 1960s. We began the study to challenge the prevailing consensus at the time that primary school children were either preoperational or concrete operational in their cognitive development and they could not learn abstract concepts. Our early research, based on Ausubelian theory, suggested otherwise. The paper describes the development and implementation of a Grade 1–2 audio tutorial science instructional sequence, and the subsequent tracing over 12 years, of the children’s conceptual understandings in science compared to a matched control group. During the study the concept map was developed as a new tool to trace children’s conceptual development. We found that students in the instruction group far outperformed their non-instructed counterparts, and this difference increased as they progressed through middle and high school. The data clearly support the earlier introduction of science instruction on basic science concepts, such as the particulate nature of matter, energy and energy transformations. The data suggest that national curriculum standards for science grossly underestimate the learning capabilities of primary-grade children. The study has helped to lay a foundation for guided instruction using computers and concept mapping that may help both teachers and students become more proficient in understanding science.

AB  - Concept mapping activities were trialed over a 2 year period as part of an undergraduate microbiology course. This paper describes this developmental process and offers insight into the most beneficial ways of employing this tool in a higher education setting. The aim was to investigate the use of mapping activities to improve students' integration of the material presented and as a method of course evaluation. It was found that the emphasis placed on concepts at the beginning of the course had a profound influence on the trajectory of conceptual development exhibited by students. Once established, initial conceptual structures seemed resistant to change and restricted the subsequent choice of superordinate concepts. The approach was modified in the second year. Students were encouraged to restructure their understanding by producing a concept map as part of a collaborative group. The concept labels were prescribed and excluded the terminology that had appeared to constrain conceptual development in the previous year. Findings suggest that in order to optimize concept mapping activities they should: (1) reflect a student-centred teaching philosophy; (2) be collaborative; (3) be given sufficient time for reflection and development; (4) avoid using specific terms that restrict conceptual development by hindering appropriate switching between opposing conceptual frameworks. Linking the mapping activity to course grades provided an extrinsic motivation for active engagement in the task. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We examine the equivalence of two construct-a-concept-map techniques: construct-a-map with created linking phrases (C), and construct-a-map with selected linking phrases (S). The former places few constraints on the respondent and has been considered the gold standard; the latter is cost and time efficient. Both their products and processes are compared quantitatively and qualitatively as to total accuracy score, individual proposition scores, proposition choice, map structure complexity, proposition generation rate, and proposition generation procedures. We conclude that the two mapping techniques are not equivalent: The C technique is better than the S technique in capturing students' partial knowledge, even though the S can be scored more efficiently than C. Based on their characteristics, if used as an assessment tool, the C technique is more suitable for formative assessment while the S technique is a better fit for large-scale assessments.

AB  - Concept maps are widely used in education, and have been acclaimed for their excellent results. For efficiently using concept maps in education, computer-based concept mapping systems have been developed. However these computer-based concept mapping systems are limited in their assessment algorithms. The assessment takes only concept nodes as the primary basis, with relation links playing only a minor role. To address this problem, this study proposes a new style of concept map, called the weighted concept map, which assigns a weight to each proposition in a concept map to represent its importance. This study proposes a new assessment based on a weighted concept map and diagnosis analysis. Two studies are conducted to evaluate the methods of assessment. Copyright (c) 2005 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This pilot study introduces a scale to assess structural knowledge in concept maps. The need to increase our understanding of structural knowledge through improved assessment is made evident in a review of research that indicates that its quality is related to problem-solving abilities. The new scale is derived from Biggs and Collis' (1982) Structure of the Learning Outcome (SOLO) taxonomy and Rumelhart and Norman's (1978) modes of learning (structuring, accretion, and tuning). It is applied to link descriptions in an enhanced concept map structure that has been dubbed the "concept map+." Eight levels of link quality can be recognized with the new scale. This builds on the original concept map assessment scale of Novak and Gowin (1984) where just three types of link quality were acknowledged. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Cette étude pilote présente une échelle pour l'évaluation des connaissances structurelles dans les cartes conceptuelles. Une analyse de la recherche ayant révélé que la qualité des connaissances structurelles est liée aux habiletés de résolution de problèmes, il est évident qu'il faut améliorer nos méthodes d'évaluation pour mieux comprendre ces connaissances. La nouvelle échelle est basée sur la taxonomie de Biggs et Collis (1982) sur la structure des résultats d'apprentissage (Structure of Learning Outcome, SOLO) et sur les modes d'apprentissage de Rumelhart et Norman (1978): structuration, accroissement et adaptation. Elle est appliquée aux descriptions de liens dans une structure perfectionnée de cartes conceptuelles que l'on appelle ?concept map+.?. Cette nouvelle échelle distingue huit niveaux dans la qualité des liens, augmentant ainsi l'échelle d'évaluation originale de Novak et Gowin (1984) qui comportait seulement trois niveaux de qualité des liens.

AB  - Art and design creative techniques are increasingly used in educational and social sciences research as means to complement narrative qualitative research methodologies. Less known is the means by which art and design students may use collage, concept mapping or other artful visual tools to understand narrative in qualitative research. This article aims to demonstrate how artful methods can be combined with more traditional qualitative methodologies to uncover meaning in research texts during data analysis. The authors aim to show how both the phenomenon used and the method applied to data analysis offers a creative way to allow for meaning to emerge, while situating the research firmly in a phenomenological perspective of lived experience of the researcher through a collaborative conversation.

AB  - This study examined the effects of three concept mapping strategies in facilitating achievement of different types of educational objectives. The three concept mapping strategies were concept identifying, proposition identifying and student generated concept mapping. The instructional material was a 2000-word expository text related to the physiology and functioning of the human heart. Instruction was presented in a web based environment. Achievement was measured by three individual and a total criterion test. 105 college levels students were randomly assigned to one of four instructional treatments. Criterion tests were administered immediately after students interacted with their respective treatments. One-way analysis of variance indicated that (a.) specific concept mapping strategies can significantly improve student achievement of specific types of educational objectives and (b) all types of concept mapping strategies are not equally effective in facilitating student achievement.

AB  - This three-part article begins with a brief presentation of a framework that describes different approaches to conduct and report research on expert knowledge. The framework contrasts direct vs. indirect approaches and provides examples of each. Second, the article gives a detailed description of the methods and results of three concept mapping studies in pulmonary physiology that employ Pathfinder scaling, an indirect approach. The studies derive concepts maps for a variety of faculty experts individually and in groups. Two of the studies focus on changes in students' concept maps of the pulmonary physiology concepts as a result of instruction. Changes are gauged in terms of the degree to which students' concept maps approximate instructors' concept maps due to educational interventions. An index of student- instructor concept map similarity is also correlated with student performance on final examinations. The article concludes by articulating several 'next steps" in the Feinberg Northwestern and Wisconsin program of health sciences education research on concept mapping using Path- finder scaling.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to describe the challenges of parents of children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Nineteen birth, foster or adoptive parents were asked to answer the following question: "What are the challenges you face parenting a child with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder?" The data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Eight clusters resulted. Parents reported the challenges of preventing setbacks in their children's behavior, making time for themselves, making and keeping immediate and longer-term plans with their child, collaborating with the school, keeping the child involved in social activities, keeping their family involved in social activities, being heard by professionals, and managing their child's behavior problems. The themes were consistent with the literature on parenting children with a FASD, with the exception that participants in the study indicated that they found a lack of respect from professionals with whom they came into contact, challenging.

AB  - A study examined how the usefulness of concept maps as a research tool for science education could be improved.  Data were obtained from 170 introductory university-level engineering students who were asked to represent their understanding of the atom in a concept map.  Findings revealed that the most striking difference between common and more insightful maps was the incorporation of additional clusters describing models of the atom, beyond the clusters that just described the elements of atoms and their characteristics.  Further findings are presented.

AB  - This study examined instructional effects of three concept mapping strategies and prior knowledge in facilitating student achievement in Web-based learning environment. The three concept mapping strategies were concept matching, proposition identifying, and student generated concept mapping. The prior knowledge levels of the subjects were identified through a general physiology test. The instructional material was a 2000-word expository text about the human heart. Achievement was measured by the identification, terminology, comprehension tests, and the total test. The criterion tests measured achievement of different educational objectives at factual, conceptual, and rules and principles levels and general academic performance of university undergraduate students. The subjects were 290 undergraduate students from a large state university. The subjects completed the prior knowledge test, and participated in a 50-minute workshop on concept mapping one week prior to the experimental treatment. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups. Multivariate analysis of variance was used for data analysis. Statistical significant results were found in this study at the .05 alpha level. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Interviews were conducted with students in Singapore to determine the sources of their difficulty in understanding the concepts and propositions involved in qualitative analysis (QA).  In Singapore, students' first experience with QA is in grade 10, where high-achieving students are asked to perform a series of procedures using chemicals, apparatus, and appropriate techniques in QA experiments, observe and record what happens, and make inferences based on their observations.  Information obtained from 51 students was compared with a list of propositional knowledge statements and a concept map to determine any alternative conceptions of QA.  The results show that the main sources of difficulty in understanding QA are the formation of precipitates, formation of complex salts, and addition of acid.  Suggestions for helping students develop the appropriate framework for QA are made.

AB  - A study evaluated the use of cooperative concept mapping to encourage students to incorporate biological information into larger conceptual models.  Participants were 152 general biology students who were assigned to one of three groups.  The first group took part in a concept mapping workshop in a cooperative learning format before the first exam, the second group participated in cooperative concept mapping before the second exam, and the third group participated in the workshops before the last exam.  The results revealed that in each exam, the weighted scores of those who participated in the associated workshop exceeded the scores of those who completed an alternative assignment.  It is concluded that the processes associated with constructing concept maps in a cooperative learning format improve students' abilities to access information and use it to answer challenging questions.

AB  - The writers discuss their use of concept maps during the initial planning of a detailed curriculum in structural geology, which they have found to be very effective in promoting a constructivist approach to teaching.  Constructing concept maps during the syllabus planning process demonstrated the relationships between concepts and a sequence for their introduction, thus ensuring that the new concepts could be linked to concepts that had already been presented.  Moreover, concept maps clarified the links among concepts, highlighting the hierarchical structure of the concepts, and showing the most logical sequence for delivery of these concepts.

AB  - Concept maps that integrate and relate concepts in a nonlinear fashion are widely accepted as an educational tool that can underpin meaningful learning in medical education. However, student take-up may be affected by a number of cognitive and non-cognitive influences. In the present study, student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 conjoint MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were examined in relation to preferred learning styles according to the Felder-Silverman model. There was no statistically significant influence of dichotomous learning style dimension (sensing/intuitive; visual/verbal; active/reflector; sequential/global) on the self-reported utility of such concept maps to learning. However, when strength of preference was analysed within each dimension, moderate/strong verbal learners were found to be significantly less likely to self-report concept maps as useful relative to mild verbal learners. With this important exception, these data now suggest that student attitudes to concept maps are broadly not influenced by preferred learning styles and furthermore highlight the potential of concept maps to address a variety of different learning styles and thereby facilitate 'teaching to all types'. Concept maps could therefore potentially assist motivation, engagement and deep learning in medical and biomedical science education when used as a supplement to more traditional teaching/learning activities.

Data were obtained from 15 students in a 12th-grade chemistry class who used collaborative computerized concept mapping on a continual basis during an instructional unit.  Findings revealed that continuous and collaborative computerized concept mapping was responsible for conceptual change among students in epistemological, ontological, and social/affective domains.  Further findings are presented, and implications for research and science instruction are discussed.

AB  - Science content area texts are difficult for most middle school students, particularly whose reading skills are below grade level. This article describes an innovative approach to integrating the teaching of middle school science content and reading skills to increase levels of student success with content area textbooks. For reading instruction, this approach features carefully selected vocabulary, word reading instruction, oral (including partner reading) and silent reading with reading fluency practice as needed, and explicit instruction on comprehension strategies, such as retelling, concept mapping, and summarization. The teaching of the science content incorporates instructional design principles that have been documented to improve comprehension of science content, process skills, and higher order thinking. Six aspects of instructional design that are discussed are the identification and teaching of big ideas, the systematic instruction of vocabulary (including science affixes), a review and integration of core concepts, visual displays of how core concepts are integrated, mnemonics for core concepts, and structured hands-on activities.

AB  - The education of science teachers necessarily involves instruction around the use of computer technologies. Acadia University, a laptop institution, offers a unique setting where students are immersed in the critique of pedagogical applications of computers. The current trend to employ constructivist approaches in teaching provides a backdrop for this article, which offers a discussion of two interactive communication strategies namely asynchronous electronic discussion and negotiative concept mapping. The impacts of these approaches have been addressed with students through surveys and qualitative interviews. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - In the past three decades, there have been enormous advances in our understanding of the nature of knowledge and the processes by which humans construct new knowledge. There is now general agreement that knowledge is a human creation, where new ideas are constructed by creative people on the basis of their existing concepts and theories and of a search for new patterns or regularities in events or objects they observe. The constructed nature of knowledge means also that knowledge in every domain continues to evolve over time. We see concepts as the fundamental building blocks of knowledge, and we define concepts as perceived regularities or patterns in events or objects, or records of events or object, designated by a label, usually a word. There have been even greater advances in our understanding of human leaning in the past three decades. These advances have focused on the importance of learners' prior knowledge for the acquisition of new knowledge and on the need to sequence instruction to build upon the learners' existing concepts and proposition and that this process can be most productive when the learner consciously seeks to integrate new concepts and propositions into her/his congnitive structure, a process that requires meaningful learning, in contrast to the role learning or memorization so common in school learning. Since 1963, our work has been based on the congnitive psychology of David Ausubel, including the design of the audio-tutorial lessons used in a 12-year longitudinal study of children's science concept learning and the development of a tool we call a concept map to represent knowledge organized into cognitive structures. It has been possible to show explicitly the progressive growth in children's understanding of science concepts and propositions over time, and in some cases, the lack of such growth. Concept maps have subsequently been used to help students learn how to learn, to capture and archive expert knowledge, and to facilitate creative production. We have also shown that the learning capabilities of young children have been grossly underestimated, especially for "abstract" concepts about the nature of matter and energy (see, e.g., the recommendations for national science standards; National Research Council, 1996). In the past decade, there has been the incredible development of the Internet to share information on virtually any topic. Moreover, enormously increased computer power, transmission band width, and other technological advances now make it possible to provide to any learner almost anywhere in the world all of the information needed to gain mastery of any subject. We are currently seeking ways to exploit these potentials, especially with the use of new concept-mapping software, to help teachers and students 'scaffold' their learning, using expert concept maps and the collaborative possibilities of the new technologies.

An independent measures research design was used. There were two treatment groups: computer and paper/pencil. The computer group created concept maps using Inspiration software on desktop computers. The paper/pencil group made concept maps in the traditional manner. The t statistic was used to evaluate the mean difference between the two treatments. The group using the computer created more complex maps than the group that used paper/pencil. This difference was significant. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The writers discuss the revised goals that they have developed for a one-semester mineralogy course.  The goals concern introducing crystallography, crystal chemistry, and systematic mineralogy; relating the physical properties of minerals to their crystal structures; introducing the analytical methods used in modern mineralogy; learning how minerals are classified and named; identifying minerals in hand specimen and thin section, and with the aid of various analytical techniques; appreciating the influence of crystal chemistry on mineral assemblages and mineral weathering; and developing the ability to research and learn mineralogical topics individually and in groups.  The writers also detail the four basic forms of newer types of pedagogy that they use to accomplish these goals:  spiral learning, inquiry-based learning, concept maps, and interactive models and visualization.

AB  - The integration of science and humanities is not an easy task, these areas of study seem to generate graduates with very different mindsets. The challenge facing these authors is to run a postgraduate programme in the field of Information Communication Technology (ICT) and Education, in particular to integrate and blend the views of the participants of the course, a cohort that is evenly divided into 'techies' and 'educationalists'. The programme is strongly grounded on Constructionist principles (Papert, 1993a; Papert, 1993b). In line with these principles, this paper explores the use of concept-mapping as an experiential strategy to teach constructionism. In addition, the concept-maps are used to facilitate the participants in the articulation of their knowledge of the relationship between technology and learning. Further, it is hoped that they promote learning in terms of awareness raising, reflection and construction of new conceptual structures as the consequence of "the shock of our thoughts coming into contact with that of others "(Piaget, 1928: 204).

AB  - Several effective instructional strategies that enhance conceptual understanding of science are presented.  Drawn from experiences of chemistry instruction at elementary, secondary, and college level, the strategies relate to the use of the learning cycle,  science/technology/society,  real-life situations, discrepant events, collaborative learning, analogy, concept mapping, wait-time, mathematical problem-solving, and inquiry approaches to science instruction.  These instructional strategies can be integrated into various educational contexts.  One or two references for each strategy is provided.

AB  - Enumerates various paths that may lead to knowledge discovery (KD). Most of these paths begin from knowing what exists. To know what exists about an entity requires comprehensively assembling relevant data and information, in-depth analysis of the information, and identifying relations among the concepts in the related and even apparently unrelated subjects. Provision has to be made to reorganize and synthesize the information retrieved and/or that obtained through observation, experiment, survey, etc. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have considerably augmented the capabilities of information systems. Such ICT applications may range from the simple to sophisticated computerized systems, with data gathered using aerial photography, remote sensing, satellite imagery, large radar and planetary telescopes and many other instrument records of phenomena, as well as downloading via the Internet. While classification helps in data prospecting and data mining, for it to assist the KD process effectively it has to be supplemented with good indexes, hypertext links, access to statistical and modeling techniques, etc. Computer software assists text analysis, complex data manipulation, computation, statistical analysis, concept mapping, etc. But manual information systems can also assist KD. Enumerates several prerequisites to KD and relevant tools and techniques to be incorporated into information support systems. Presents case studies of information systems and services that assisted KD. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - A study investigated how native Turkish speakers with no previous experience of concept mapping represented the relationships on a concept map.  The participants were 55 Turkish undergraduate elementary education students who had no previous knowledge of concept mapping.  Findings revealed that participants employed reasonable methods to express relationships on concept maps developed in Turkish.  The methods involved writing relationships as complete sentences on connecting lines, verbally explaining the concept map, or explaining relationships in brief paragraphs below the concept map.  Other findings and implications of this study are discussed.

AB  - A systemic approach to chemical education is presented.  The systemic approach means an arrangement of concepts or issues through interacting systems in which all relationships between concepts and issues are made explicit via a concept map-like representation.  Such an approach can help students begin to understand interrelationships between concepts in a greater context and teach people in all areas of human activity—economic, political, and scientific—to practice a more global view of the core science relationships and to show them the importance of science to such activities.  The application of the systemic approach to learning the chemistry of organic acids and their derivatives is described in detail.

AB  - The article presents a discussion on electronic forums and concept mapping software as two technology applications that can provide better training for potential teachers of science. These applications facilitate literacy in the foundational standard of using technology as a research tool, as they apply readily to organizing and synthesizing information from Internet searches. The International Society for Technology Education's (ISTE) "National Educational Technology Standards" (NETS) for teachers state that all teachers need to demonstrate an understanding of the NETS' "foundational" standards for students. Electronic forums can also be employed to foster a community-based learning environment, where learners have a common goal of producing knowledge related to a certain task.

AB  - This article considers effective dialogue between teacher and student essential for promoting meaningful learning in the classroom. Effective dialogue enables teachers and students to be active in the construction of shared understanding by making explicit the overlap between the perspective held by novice (student) and expert (teacher). Concept maps provide a visual tool to illustrate such overlap in understanding and create something tangible to promote meaningful discussion. A description of a model of practice to help uncover and explore this overlap is given. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

Data were collected on 162 eighth-grade science students at a middle school in South Central Kentucky.  Results indicated that African-American students who used concept mapping as a tool performed better than those students who did not use it.  This finding suggests a need for science teachers working with African-American students to vary their methodology and to use the concept mapping strategy as a learning tool.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of combining conceptual change text and concept mapping strategy on students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis. Students' conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis was measured using the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test developed by Odom and Barrow (1995). The test was administered as pretest and post-test to a total of 44 ninth-grade students in two intact classes of the same high school located in an urban area. The experimental group was a class of 24 students who received concept mapping and conceptual change text instruction. A class of 20 students comprised the control group who received a traditional instruction. Group Assessment of Logical Thinking Test (GALT) and pretest scores were used as covariates in this study. A pretest-post-test control group design utilising the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the favour of the experimental group after treatment. The results indicated that while the average percentage of students in the experimental group holding a scientifically correct view had risen from 22.5% to 54.1%, a gain of 31.6%, the percentage of correct responses of the students in the control group had increased from 19.1% to 38.7%, a gain of 19.6% after treatment.

AB  - The use of group concept mapping to teach biological concepts was evaluated.  For the past 20 years, concept mapping has been demonstrated to be an ideal means of promoting meaningful learning.  Student understanding of the concepts of photosynthesis and cellular respiration was assessed after students had used concept mapping in their biology classes.  The findings showed that the performance of students who generated concept maps in small groups was better than that of students who generated maps as individuals or who did not generate concept maps.  In the unit on photosynthesis and cellular respiration, which is rich in concepts, students were able to discuss misunderstandings of science concepts and teach one another these biology concepts with the aid of group concept mapping.  All members of the group could then observe, agree with, and modify explanations prior to submitting them for a grade.

AB  - Concept mapping can be used successfully in the organic chemistry laboratory.  To draw a concept map, students divide a blank piece of paper into blocks with pencil lines, and then, in each block, in the appropriate sequence of concepts, they draw the apparatus setup they are going to use.  Prior to the lab, one concept (panel) is assigned to a cooperative group of two or more lab teams, and at the beginning of the lab, groups draw the panels on the blackboard for the entire class.  This technique works well as compared to the traditional prelab and discussion because the concept map gives the experimental procedure an easily recognizable mental skeleton and by doing the drawing in real time, students internalize and understand.  An organic lab exercise on the synthesis of a carbon compound that uses concept mapping is described.

AB  - The article discusses human constructivist view of learning that can guide research and assist the interpretation of research data because it recognizes an individual's prior knowledge and active involvement in knowledge construction during a museum visit. In general, learning is represented as conceptual change, and some researchers refer specifically to a conceptual change theory of learning. In examining the nature and character of learning emergent from individuals' experiences in informal contexts, one might draw on a variety of theoretical frameworks. Students were selected for intensive case study involving investigation of their knowledge transformations resulting from a free-choice science center visit, subsequent classroom-based post-visit activities, and other personal experiences that the students had at home and in their discretionary time. As part of the data collection strategies, these students completed concept maps representing their understandings of topic domains, and were interviewed three times during the research.

AB  - Research into learning in informal settings such as museums has been in a formative state during the past decade, and much of that research has been descriptive and lacking a theory base.  In this article, it is proposed that the human constructivist view of learning can guide research and assist the interpretation of research data because it recognizes an individual's prior knowledge and active involvement in knowledge construction during a museum visit.  This proposal is supported by reference to the findings of a previously reported interpretive case study, which included concept mapping and semistructured interviews, of the knowledge transformations of three Year 7 students who had participated in a class visit to a science museum and associated postvisit activities.  The findings from that study are shown in this report to be consistent with the human constructivist view of learning in that for all three students, learning was found to be at times incremental and at other times to involve substantial restructuring of knowledge.  Thus, we regard that the human constructivist view of learning has much merit and utility for researchers investigating the development of knowledge and understanding emergent from experiences in informal settings.  The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for teachers and staff of museums and similar institutions are also discussed.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The article focuses on concept mapping as an integral instructional system in colleges. The use of concept mapping has been demonstrated to be an integral and effective part of the instructional strategy in an evolution course. A course such as evolution is concept rich; its increasingly sophisticated concepts build, relate, and interrelate as the course develops. Concept mapping appears to lend itself to such cognitive construction, because it requires thinking about possible arrangements of the concepts and about establishing meaningful relationships (linkages and cross-linkages) among the concepts. The ultimate meaning that such a course has for a given student consists of the entire network of propositions he or she has learned. Concept mapping fosters creation of these connections. In fact, when grading student maps, the instructor's largest percentage of written comments on individual maps related to the student's choices of linking words used to forge such connections. It seems clear that a basic understanding of organic evolution and its conceptual framework is necessary to benefit from a biological curriculum at all levels, especially at the college level.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to (a) describe how concept mapping can be used as an intergrate instructional strategy for teaching a college course on evolution, (b) evaluate the utility of incorporating concept mapping in a college course on evolution, (c) determine whether students' concept maps reveaes “critical junctures” in learning as the course unfolds, and (d) assess the impact of concept mapping of students' study practices and on students' understanding of course content. Key findings include: (a) Critical junctures in learning evolution can be identified by monitoring the degree of concordance of superordinate concepts appearing on the class set of concept maps submitted after each of the course lectures; (b) students who made concept maps reported spending an average of 37% more study time of this college biology course than on their previous biology courses; and (c) the use of “seed concepts, ” “micromapping,” a standard concept map format, and a standard concept map checklist made the strategy feasible for the instructor to implement and for the student to adopt. A concept map performance index formulas was also developed for this research study in order to assess students' overall mapping performance. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Understanding how people think and how people organise knowledge are always major concerns for educational researchers. Hence, educators have developed various ways of representing learners' 'cognitive structures'. This article provides a review of the use of five methods of representing cognitive structures -- free word association, controlled word association, tree construction, concept map and flow map. Through comparing the types of analyses that are generated from these cognitive structure representation methods, this paper discusses the applications, as well as the limitations, among these methods.

AB  - After an instructor has used a Web-based forum in a course for years, the system database will contain an accumulation of discussion messages, which may be on similar topics, from different classes within a course. Furthermore, the discussion processes of some classes may be very heuristic for other learners in the same course. In general, a Web-based forum serves as additional channels for learners to discuss learning topics in the absence of an instructor. However, an instructor may want to guide learners in reading meaningful discussion messages in previous learners' discussion records when a similar question is asked. Hence, it is necessary to model the relationships between discussion messages from different classes in the same course. Furthermore, an instructor desires no unanswered question, called a dangling question, in a Web-based forum because of the possible negative influences, such as discouraging learners to raise questions. This paper proposes a concept-mapping method, which originates from information retrieval technology, for representing the relationships between learners' questions and previous learners' discussion messages. Consequently, the methodology enables an instructor to locate easily from the system database a set of discussion messages with conceptual similarity as answers to eliminate the dangling question.

AB  - A study examined the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge about and attitudes toward sharks.  Participants, who constructed a concept map about sharks and responded to an attitude inventory, were 238 retired individuals, college students, and public school students.  The results indicated that even the youngest students have some well-defined ideas about sharks and related vertebrates.  These ideas become more complex and scientifically valid with age.  It was also found that college students who have formal educational opportunities to learn about these organisms develop a well-structured knowledge base about them.

AB  - A teaching method that engaged biology students in creative concept mapping is presented.  The method required students to use a potato stamp to construct a concept map in astronomy.  The concept mapping activity ensured meaningful learning, allowing students to show a visual representation of their understanding of a recently studied topic and to use their creativity to add a personal element to their projects and thus gain ownership and have a more positive attitude toward classroom activities.

AB  - The use of concept maps to evaluate student understanding of general chemistry was examined.  Concept mapping was introduced in a range of situations during a university chemistry course to encourage the use of concept maps.  For students, teaching assistants (TAs), and professors, concept maps offered opportunities for personal reflection on their understanding of concepts.  Concept mapping also provided TAs and professors with the potential ability to recognize difficulties students have with particular concepts.  As they work with students' concept maps in the classroom and while grading, TAs and professors need to appreciate the critical information that can be drawn from these visual representations of students' knowledge.  Students' concept maps also indicate that students have to organize their knowledge structure in appropriate ways to successfully construct meaningful understandings.  Professors and TAs can also evaluate concept maps to observe the ability of students to correlate the micro- and macroscopic worlds.

AB  - The conceptions and knowledge structures of evolutionary theory held by teachers with different levels of acceptance of the theory were analyzed.  A response survey and a concept mapping activity were sent to 989 biology teachers in public high schools in Indiana.  Analysis of the responses showed a strong trend of increased time dedicated to the topic of evolution with increased teacher acceptance of evolutionary theory.  The concept maps of teachers in the nonacceptance, undecided, and acceptance groups, respectively, were characterized by dismissal of evolutionary theory and a lack of detail about evolutionary mechanisms, by the inclusion of both scientific and religious concepts, and by the recognition of evolutionary mechanisms and the inclusion of much detail about the process of natural selection.  The academic background and personal religious beliefs of teachers may contribute to teacher acceptance of evolution, as well as the teaching of evolution.

AB  - The ImpacT2 evaluation is using image based concept mapping as one method of exploring the impact of networked technologies on students' learning. In a pre-test administered in June 2000, students in three cohorts aged 10-11, 13-14 and 15-16, produced around 2000 'maps'. Entitled 'Computers in My World', these provide a means of students externalising mental representations of networked technologies. Using a phenomenographic approach, the study aims to identify qualitatively different patterns of thinking and trends in the development of pupils' concepts. Five quanititative measures emerged from heuristic analysis of the maps: nodes, links, connectivity, 'Spheres of Thinking' and 'Zones of Use'. Analysis of the pre-test maps was carried out alongside analysis of pre-test questionnaires, using SPSS. The outcomes suggest correlations between pupils' experience and the constent of their maps. Phenomenographic interviewing of selected 11 year old pupils, which entailed handling control over to interviewees through the use of open-ended questions, enabled further exploration of their experiences and understandings of those experiences. A method for in-depth interviewing of young students is described. Data suggest that pupils have sophisticated 'secondary artifacts' or mental models of the nature of networked technologies and their role in today's world. This has implications for the way that ICT is used in schools and for its potential as a tool for students' learning. Copyright (c) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd

AB  - Research traditions in education and information retrieval have grown up in parallel worlds, although they share a theoretical foundation that profoundly influences research methodology and best practice in their respective domains. They also share a common problem: the need for a method for analyzing sparse, quantifiable data collected in qualitative studies with small sample sizes. This paper explores the theory of expected information, which uses formulas derived from the Fano measure (1961) and Bayesian statistics (1764), and demonstrates its application in a study on the effects of concept mapping on the searching behavior of tenth-grade biology students.

AB  - The use of student-constructed concept maps in assessment is congruent with the changing emphases set forth by the National Science Education Standards. Authorities have expressed concern about concept map scoring systems and their associated validity and reliability. They favor methods that employ expert/criterion maps as referents and emphasize the use of accurate concept relationships in deriving scores, which have been found to correlate with performance on standardized tests. In this study, student constructed concept maps (n = 17) that emerged from post-instructional interviews about chlorofluorocarbons were scored against a teacher-expert map using a scheme weighted for relationships. Interrater reliability for the scoring scheme was high (r = .959). Students' map scores correlated highly with their scores on the California Achievement Test component total (r = .729) and moderately with their Pathfinder index (r = .474), the latter believed to be an excellent measure of structural knowledge. A revised map score, derived only from relationships containing one or more of the concepts employed in Pathfinder analysis, was a statistically significant (p = .031) predictor of the Pathfinder index. The findings of this study support the recommendations of others to use expert referents and emphasize concept relationships in assessing concept maps. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Part of a special issue on promoting thinking through peer learning. Three studies examined the potential of collaborative concept mapping. Data were obtained from students aged 15–16 years in high school physics classes who collaborated in pairs on a concept mapping task about electricity.  Results revealed that the collaborative concept mapping task provoked and supported a productive student discourse about the meanings and relationships of the physics concepts. Furthermore, the task supported the elaboration of conceptual knowledge and the coconstruction of meanings among peers.  The limitations of the concept mapping task are discussed and strategies for overcoming them are outlined.

AB  - Despite many research reports that indicate the classroom benefits of concept mapping, secondary-level biology teachers in Great Britain fail to exploit the benefits of this approach within their classrooms. This suggests a problem with the concept mapping approach that has not been addressed explicitly in the research.  Specifically, two of the primary obstacles to the integration of concept mapping into biology classrooms in Great Britain are teachers' epistemological beliefs and the underlying philosophy of the curriculum and assessment they must deliver.  Each of these obstacles is discussed.

AB  - A study investigated the effects of visualization and concept mapping on the learning of secondary school chemistry students in Belgium. Participants were 132 final year students from ten classes in three Belgian secondary schools, assigned to the study of electrochemistry under four research situations.  They included a control condition and visualization, concept mapping, and visualization and concept mapping conditions.  Results revealed that visualization had a positive impact on participants' learning but that a combination of visualization and concept mapping had no significant impact on the learning of participants.  Other results of the study are discussed, and recommendations for future research are provided.

AB  - The Vee map offers an alternative to the traditional report in undergraduate hydrology laboratories.  This tool is a graphic organizer that shows the interrelated areas of a focus question, a word list, a concept map, events, data and data transformation, and conclusions and claims.  It guides students in their laboratory experience and facilitates reflective thinking and learning.  However, the use of the Vee map presents new challenges related to the instructor's comfort level in incorporating a nontraditional report in the laboratory experience and to the onus on the instructor to collect data on student learning.  Results of a study that indicate positive student attitudes toward the Vee map are presented.

AB  - A study examined the effectiveness of concept mapping, the learning cycle, expository instruction, and concept mapping/learning cycle instructional strategies in promoting understanding of diffusion and osmosis in high school biology.  Data were collected from 108 secondary students enrolled in four biology classes who were taught diffusion and osmosis concepts with the four different instructional strategies.  Findings suggest that the concept mapping and concept mapping/learning cycle strategies significantly outperformed expository teaching with regard to conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis.  However, findings also show that there was no significant difference between the concept mapping and concept mapping/learning cycle treatments and the learning cycle treatment.

AB  - In this article we present an analytic framework that we used to study the quality of student discourse in collaborative learning tasks that focus on deepening conceptual understanding. We illustrate this framework with an example of two boys who collaborated on a concept mapping task about electricity. Inspired by socio-constructivist and sociocultural perspectives on science learning and instruction we focus on the amount and type of discourse about concepts, the amount and type of elaboration, the amount and type of co-construction and on the use of available tools. We show how these dimensions shape the conditions for deepening students' understanding of concepts. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Conducted in Israel, this research probes students' understanding of the relationships between genetic concepts. Four populations were examined: 9th graders (14 - 15 year olds), who were exposed to genetics for the first time (n = 184); 12th graders (17 - 18 year olds), who were studying biology as their main subject (n = 121); college pre-service teachers, who had not yet earned a degree (n = 29); and university pre-service teachers, who had earned biology degrees and were seeking teacher certification (n = 22). Three research instruments were used: a written questionnaire, interviews, and concept maps. The questions were open-ended to enable the identification of students' patterns of comprehensive thinking and understanding, not identifiable in multiple choice testing. Alternative conceptions and compartmentalisation between related concepts were identified. Based on these findings, genetic instruction in 9th and 12th grade and in college needs improvement.

AB  - The majority of public school teachers do not feel well prepared to use instructional technology. Professional development on computer-based concept mapping responds to this concern through focusing on a tool/software that has many applications and is not difficult to master. A subset (n = 18) of science teachers in a Health Sciences and Technology Academy (HSTA) completed a workshop on electronic concept mapping and were provided with school site licenses and other follow-up support (summer institute). They utilized the software in academic enrichment for underserved students, regular classroom instruction, and inservice training for colleagues. Triangulation of findings from data sources (electronic conferencing, lesson plans, workshop evaluations) revealed that HSTA teachers embrace electronic concept mapping as a versatile educational tool. Factors contributing to this enthusiasm included the ease with which students use the software, the transparent nature of the learning process for these students, and the positive attitudes of colleagues whom they have inserviced. The findings from this project are congruent with what experts contend to be critical features of effective teacher professional development: facilitating a community of learners and providing sustained support. This project now funds software use in over 45 public schools. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The writers describe a novel method for analyzing concept maps for research and analysis purposes.  The method involves a novel means of coding and assessing concept maps based on the utility, the stability, and the complexity of the links.  It differs from other methods in that the coding scheme does not rely on the hierarchical nature of the map, the map's organization, or the differentiation, discrimination, and integration of the concept map.  Instead, this novel method focuses on the propositional knowledge contained in the links, the stability of students' knowledge, and the level of complexity of the links.  The method has been validated by administrating it to a sample of 56 complex concept maps that had been generated from student interviews on the topic of chemical bonding.

AB  - The use of concepts maps in the teaching of general chemistry was evaluated.  Concept maps, potentially powerful tools for effecting conceptual change in the classroom, have been proposed as a way of facilitating the formation by students of links between content areas. The extent to which students in 2 sections of a general chemistry course for science and engineering—one of which involved the use of concept maps and the other of which did not—linked concepts relating to electrons, bonding, electronegativity, and molecular geometry was analyzed.  The results showed that students in the section that used concept maps made more complex connections between concepts than did students in the control section.  Thus, the use of concept maps as an integral part of students' course work may provide students with a potent learning and study tool.

AB  - Student teachers have at their disposal various information sources concerning teaching: their own beliefs, their mentors' practical knowledge, and 'theory'. Because practical knowledge often remains implicit, the aim of the present study was to explore the appropriateness of two techniques for its articulation: concept mapping and completing sentences. The criterion used was that these should not only elicit descriptions of how to teach, but also the cognitions underlying teaching, i.e., practical knowledge. Thirty-five student teachers and their mentors at a postgraduate teacher-training institute in the Netherlands used both techniques, concerning the subject of 'order'. Subsequently, the students summarized their own beliefs, their mentors' practical knowledge, and theory and compared these to each other. The student teachers' reports showed that they, in general, had been able to elicit partially their mentors' practical knowledge. It was concluded that the use of the techniques involved seemed valuable for student teachers' learning processes. Copyright (c) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd

Our purpose is to introduce a handful of evaluation and measurement techniques that help students assimilate well-integrated, strongly cohesive frameworks of interrelated concepts as a way of facilitating ‘real understanding’ of natural phenomena. Among these methods are concept maps, V diagrams, SemNet software, image-based test items, clinical interviews, portfolios, written products, performance measures, and conceptual diagnostic tests. Evidence suggests that these methods are most useful at highlighting ‘alternative conceptions’ and assisting students who wish to ‘learn how to learn’. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - We studied the occurrence and nature of learning in a university first year Introduction to Geomorphology course, and its relation to prior knowledge taught in a prerequisite course, and with the prior knowledge in the to be learned subjects.  Ten dimensions of knowledge were tapped before and after the course by conventional and cognitive structure measures that were derived by the concept mapping methodology.  The fine-grain analysis of learning outcomes yielded the following outcomes:  (a) students acquired only a small portion of the content in the course Introduction to Geomorphology, (b) the prior geological and geomorphological knowledge did not affect the learning of the new geomorphological content, (c) the minor effects appeared within rather than across knowledge dimensions, and they affected mainly the learning of smaller knowledge units, and (d) concept definition cannot be considered a valid probe of knowledge.  The differential effects of prior knowledge question the central, global and undifferentiated role that schema theories ascribe to prior knowledge in future learning.  They call for greater reference to the exposed dimensions of knowledge by suggesting additional factors to be considered in the sequencing of courses, as well as to the acquisition of complex knowledge with partial meaning of the basic knowledge units, and the use of new cognitive structure probes of knowledge.

AB  - The writers discuss Project Quorum, a project that included public and private schools throughout Latin America, from Chile to Mexico.  The main aim of this project was to promote meaningful learning, which required learners to relate new knowledge to relevant knowledge they already possessed in some substantive, nontrivial way.  Although the project has finished, many of the schools that took part in it still use the software that was developed during the project.

AB  - Abstract Concept mapping has been applied in a variety of fields, including instruction, learning, curriculum development, and assessment. Because many empirical studies have proven the validity of concept mapping, a computer-based concept mapping system has been developed. The system provides two learning environments. In the ‘construct-by-self’ environment, the system provides students with the evaluation results and corresponding hints for feedback. The students construct concept maps by themselves with only the assistance of the feedback. In the ‘construct-on-scaffold’ environment, in addition to the feedback, the students receive an incomplete concept map, within which some nodes and links were set as blanks for the scaffold. A study comparing the effectiveness of the ‘construct-by-self’, ‘construct-on-scaffold’, and ‘construct by paper-and-pencil’ concept mapping showed that the ‘construct-on-scaffold’ had better effect for learning on biology. Both of the two computer-based procedures are helpful for students in completing their concept maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract The study reported in this paper developed and evaluated a web-based concept map testing system for science students. Thirty-eight Taiwanese high school students were involved and it was found that their performance on the system was not significantly related to their achievement as measured by traditional standard tests. Their views about the use of the system, in general, were positive. An analysis of students' future use of the system and their motivation and learning strategies revealed that those with more critical thinking metacognitive activities and an effort regulation management strategy showed more willingness to use the online testing system. Moreover, students with high test anxiety showed a preference to be tested through the system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Two studies were conducted to assess the validity of using select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map scores as a measure of students' connected understanding of science.  Findings revealed that undergraduate students' scores from SAFI maps demonstrated large relationships with scores from direct-instructon multiple-choice exams and scores from a relatedness rating measure, taken together and separately.  These findings offer initial proof of the validity of SAFI scores as measures of connected understanding of science in middle school and undergraduate introductory science students.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a study that compared two concept-mapping techniques, one high-directed, “fill-in-the-map,” and one low-directed, “construct a-map-from-scratch.”  We examined whether:  (l) skeleton map scores were sensitive to the sample of nodes or linking lines to be filled in; (2) the two types of skeleton maps were equivalent; and (3) the two mapping techniques provided similar information about students' connected understanding.  Results indicated that fill-in-the-map scores were not sensitive to the sample of concepts or linking lines to be filled in.  Nevertheless, the fill-in-the-nodes and fill-in-the-lines techniques were not equivalent forms of fill-in-the-map.  Finally, high-directed and low-directed maps led to different interpretations about students' knowledge structure.  Whereas scores obtained under the high-directed technique indicated that students' performance was close to the maximum possible, the scores obtained with the low-directed technique revealed that students' knowledge was incomplete compared to a criterion map. We concluded that the construct-a-map technique better reflected differences among students' knowledge structure.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This article focuses on a study related to two concept-mapping techniques. Concept maps have been used to assess students' knowledge structure, especially in science education. The justification for assessing students' knowledge structures is based on the idea that relating concepts that belong to the same domain is an important characteristic of scientific literacy. Theory and research have shown that understanding a subject domain such as science is associated with a rich set of relations among important concepts in the domain. A concept map is a graph in which the nodes represent concepts, the lines between nodes represent relations, and the labels on the lines represent the nature of the relations. The combination of two nodes and a labeled line is called a proposition-the fundamental unit of the map. The characterization of a concept map assessment as based on its three components-task, response format, and scoring system-has revealed the enormity of variations in mapping techniques used in research and practice.

AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction to 10th-grade students' understanding of the human circulatory system. To determine misconceptions concerning the human circulatory system, 10 eleventh-grade students were interviewed. In the light of the findings obtained from student interviews and related literature, the Human Circulatory System Concepts Test was developed. The data were obtained from 26 students in the experimental group taught with the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping, and 23 students in the control group taught with the traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous learning in biology and science process skills were other independent variables involved in this study. Multiple Regression Correlation analysis revealed that science process skill, the treatment, and previous learning in biology each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students' understanding of the human circulatory system. It was found that the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction produced a positive effect on students' understanding of concepts. The mean scores of experimental and control groups showed that students in the experimental group performed better with respect to the human circulatory system. Item analysis was carried out to determine and compare the proportion of correct responses and misconceptions of students in both groups. The average percent of correct responses of the experimental group was 59.8%, and that of the control group was 51.6% after treatment. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Task-related variance causes scores from performance assessments not to be generalizable and thus inappropriate for high stakes use. It is possible that task-related variance is due, in part, to students' inability to transfer their knowledge consistently from one assessment task to another. Therefore, concept-mapping, a cognitive tool, might be useful to aid this transfer. This study examines the effects of concept maps on the task-related variance components of Political Science performance assessments. On three quizzes, some students used concept maps while writing two essays, while other students did not. The task variance components remained unchanged across groups, but the person main effect components increased and the task-by-person interaction components decreased for those using concept maps. Also, the scores from the concept mapping groups had higher generalizability coefficients than for those who did not use a concept map. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

A total of ninety Taiwanese eleventh graders were tested through the on-line system and they, then, completed a questionnaire. The responses of the questionnaire revealed that the speed of information transferring, supported by the system was not quick enough. However, students did not think on-line test would cause some problems of cheating. More than a half of the subjects showed willingness of using the system in the future.

AB  - The concept mapping technique was employed to evaluate student learning outcomes in an online and CD-ROM hybrid learning project that involved elementary and high school students in both middle and low socioeconomic status areas.  The reason for selecting this technique was that it could be employed with a wide variety of content and with all grade levels of students.  In this context, it consisted of an open-ended concept map activity used with a rubric that gathered quantitative information about the quality of understanding from each of the maps.  The development of the methodology for this concept mapping assessment technique is described, and issues of validity and reliability are discussed.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of multimedia authoring as a learning tool, using the software ASTOUND.  The subjects in this study were 32 students in two Grade 12 classes.  The context of the study was a multi-disciplinary environmental unit about earthquakes.  Students were provided with basic background about earthquakes via laboratory experiments and field trips.  At a later stage, the students did in-depth independent projects on selected topics related to earthquakes.  Once completed, the students presented their projects using the multimedia software ASTOUND.  The research consisted of the following stages:  a pre-development phase; curriculum design phase; implementation and evaluation.  The research tools included:  questionnaires, interviews, observations, concept mapping, and an analysis of the multimedia presentations.  The findings showed that an integration of laboratory exercises, field trips, and an independent study project, could lead to meaningful learning.  However, although most of the students enjoyed using the multimedia program, there was no evidence to support the assumption that it contributed to knowledge acquisition.  In fact, much of the time invested in multimedia authoring was devoted to producing decorative effects, reducing the time available for meaningful learning.

AB  - Part of a special section on great instructional strategies for geoscience teachers.  A teaching method that involves the use of a mind map or concept map of geology to teach introductory geology is presented.  Suitable for use with groups of all levels, this method is effective for breaking down the image that geology is only about rocks.

AB  - Low-achieving seventh-grade students from an urban parochial school were randomly assigned to two equally sized groups (n = 62, each group). One group was taught by a read-and-discuss, teacher-directed method, and the second group, given the same type of introductory lesson as the first, followed a model of concept mapping that connected major and minor concept ideas. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a sclence chapter served as the dependent variable. Prior to any teaching, a pretest was administered. An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate showed a statistically significant difference in comprehension between the pretest and posttest for the experimental group. Effect size estimates revealed that concept mapping can be expected to improve comprehension scores of low-achieving seventh graders by approximately six standard deviations over a traditional instructional technique. When students lack background information on a topic to aid comprehension, the active participation in constructing semantic or concept maps may help students form a cognitive schema to assimilate and relate the new topic information.

AB  - The writer suggests possible links between a biology teacher's understanding of ecology and an understanding of conceptual change research.  A conceptual ecology analogy may enable more effective communication of conceptual change research to practitioners through language that is familiar to biology.  Comparisons between “conceptual ecology” and “ecosystem ecology” can be drawn in the areas of concept mapping, keystone concepts, a systems view of conceptual change, the holistic versus the reductionist view of ecosystem ecology, conflicting conceptions, and the contextual switch in photosynthesis.  The adoption of an ecosystemic view of conceptual change made explicit through students' concept maps might help teachers to move toward a more constructivist classroom approach.

AB  - The text of a paper presented at the Association for Library and Information Science Education Annual Conference, which was held in San Antonio, Texas, on January 11–14, 2000, is provided.  A usability study examined an Internet-based hypertext learning system for distance education developed at Florida State University's School of Information Studies.  Data were obtained from a navigational preference measure that used concept mapping to determine the preferred navigational path of 12 students enrolled at the school and to compare it to the system designers' optimal path.  Results supported the use of navigational preference and concept mapping for usability evaluation of hypertext systems.  Results also showed that students did not think of contact or interaction with others as communication and equated the syllabus with the course.  Results highlighted differences in how novice and experienced users preferred to navigate the system but indicated that not much system interaction was required for users to adopt experienced navigational behaviors. Suggestions for further research are presented.

AB  - The study examined how features of student interaction, and the way an individual student contributes to that interaction (his or her participation), relates to the improvement of conceptual understanding within the domain of physics. The study also investigated how textbooks are used during collaborative work and how that use affects the quality of student interaction and outcomes. The participants were 56 students aged 15 or 16. The students worked in dyads on a concept-mapping task that functioned as an introduction for a new course about electricity. A condition in which the students were provided with 2 textbooks was compared with a condition without the availability of textbooks. The use of textbooks had a negative influence on the amount of elaboration and coconstruction in the student interaction. Individual learning outcomes were positively related to the amount of collaborative elaboration in the student interaction.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Economic constraints, profound changes in the healthcare system and insufficient educational expertise have gripped medical education. The objective of this study was to review professionalization of medical education and to contribute to an elaboration of a conceptual framework for understanding reforms. We developed a concept map based on information retrieved by searching the Medline/Knowledge Finder and the Cochrane Library databases. The descriptors used for the searches were 'certification, credentialing, education, faculty medical, quality assurance health care, research, staff development, teaching'. The endpoints for the study were: frequency, quality of studies and propositional content with regard to professionalization for developing a concept map. Thirty-one relevant studies were found in Medline.The Cochrane Library search returned no relevant studies. The evidence of the few studies was weak. The literature-derived concept map shows that faculty development is a prerequisite for certification leading to professionalization. Other related variables were resource allocation, intrinsic motivation to learn, educational research, study time, financial policy, organizational and staff development, and new specialized roles such as clinician-educator. It is concluded that professionalization of medical education is needed. This deficit underscores the need for conceptually sound research approaches. The concept of intrinsic motivation explains how to comply with scientifically based standards, thus fostering professionality. Approaches facilitating compliance, such as evidence-based learning, potentially professionalize the practice of medical education. Novel approaches such as quality management and best evidence medical education could professionalize medical education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this article we present the results of an experimental study of the influence of task characteristics on the characteristics of elaboration of conceptual knowledge in social interaction. With a pre-test and post-test we measured individual learning outcomes. We constructed a coding scheme that focuses on the communicative functions and propositional content of utterances and on elaborative episodes. The subjects were 40 students who worked in dyads on a collaborative task about electricity in one of four conditions. We compared a concept mapping task with a poster task and investigated the effect of a phase of individual preparation. The post-test scores were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. Individual preparation created better learning results and the asking of more questions. The concept mapping conditions showed more discussion of electricity concepts, collaboratively elaborated conflicts and reasoning, but no higher individual learning outcomes. In the concept mapping conditions, elaboration was related to individual learning outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Two recent studies indicate that a single mode of assessing students' learning can lead to a limited view of what they really know.  Jones et al. (J. Res. Sci. Teach. 2000;37:139–59) examined the relationship and development of students' communities of concepts related to heat convection.  They found that each of the assessment measures they used in the study (concept maps, card-sorting interviews, and diagrams) elicited different types of knowledge.  In the same issue, Voska and Heikkinen examined misconceptions associated with the application of Le Châtelier's principle using a 2-tier assessment instrument.  They concluded that instructors should construct assessment items that probe student understanding, rather than just the students' ability to identify correct or incorrect answers.

AB  - This paper describes a qualitative approach to analysing students' concept maps.  The classification highlights three major patterns which are referred to as ‘spoke’, ‘chain’ and ‘net’ structures.  Examples are given from Year 8 science classes.  The patterns are interpreted as being indicators of progressive levels of understanding.  It is proposed that identification of these differences may help the classroom teacher to focus teaching for more effective learning and may be used as a basis for structuring groups in collaborative settings.  This approach to analysing concept maps is of value because it suggests teaching approaches that help students integrate new knowledge and build upon their existing naive concepts. We also refer to the teacher's scheme of work and to the National Curriculum for science in order to consider their influence in the construction of understanding.  These ideas have been deliberately offered for early publication to encourage debate and generate feedback.  Further work is in progress to better understand how students with different conceptual structures can be most appropriately helped to achieve learning development.

AB  - A study investigated changes in the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge held by undergraduate students in an advanced university-level biology course.  A total of 74 third- and fourth-year university students participated in interviews and concept mapping exercises over a period of 16 weeks.  Among other results, it was found that a significant amount of “weak” knowledge restructuring occurred over the 16-week period.  The results suggested that gender played an important mediating role in knowledge restructuring.  Interviews with successful learners suggested that such learners may display an advanced level of awareness and a stronger ability to monitor, regulate, and control their own learning. A discussion of the significance of the findings for research and practice is provided.

AB  - The use of concept mapping in the biology classroom is discussed. Concept maps are visual construction devices or graphic organizers that can be used in any of the stages of the teaching and learning process, including planning and preparation, formative learning, revision and summarizing, and assessment.  Concept mapping can facilitate the planning of instructional sequences by providing a coherent structure to teaching materials and by making essential links explicit.  The use of concept mapping in class can help students to gain a more unified understanding of a topic, organize their knowledge for more effective problem solving, and understand the way in which they learn.  Concept maps also provide excellent summary and revision tools that condense large amounts of information.  Moreover, concept maps can be used for summative assessment.

AB  - In this study of fifth-grade students, we examined the relationships and development of communities of concepts related to heat and convection.  The study involved five classes of fifth-grade students who worked with a partner for a series of heat and convection laboratory investigations.  Students' knowledge was assessed before and after instruction through the use of a written test, concept maps, card sort tasks, and interviews.  During instruction each dyad was audiorecorded and observed by a field researcher.  The patterns and connections among students' conceptual ecologies related to heat and convection as well as the types of schemes that were accessed preceding and subsequent to instruction are described.  The types of knowledge elicited by each type of assessment are identified. Findings include the influence of familial and cultural experiences (such as airplanes, weather patterns, and religious beliefs) on conceptual development, as well as the extent to which competing phenomena (evaporation and dissolving) have on the development of new conceptual understandings.  The study also found that each assessment measure elicited different types of knowledge.  Concept maps were effective in describing students' existing schemes related to heat prior to instruction.  Multidimensional scaling and the card sorting task provided information on students' conceptual organization for clusters of concepts.  The interviews and dyed discourse transcripts were most effective in revealing the processes and prior knowledge that students used as they interpreted new observations in light of preexisting experiences.

AB  - A study examined the effectiveness of two generative learning strategies with individual learners and groups of learners in a science classroom.  Participants were 80 sixth-grade science students, randomly assigned to either concept mapping or laboratory experiments involving object manipulation and to either group or individual conditions.  Results did not reveal any difference between groups or individuals, but they did reveal a significant interaction between grouping condition and generative learning strategy.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of incorporating concept mapping into computer assisted instruction (CAI).  Ninety-one tenth-grade students in Singapore participated in the study, in which they were randomly assigned to three groups.  In the Partial Map group, partial concept maps were used in the program and the students were asked to construct concept maps after reviewing each topic; in the Complete Map group, complete concept maps were provided; and in the Menu-Selection group, traditional menu-selection interface was used.  The Complete Map group and Menu-Selection group performed note-taking activities instead of concept mapping activity.  It was found that students in the Partial Map group performed significantly better than the other two groups on a chemistry achievement test and significantly better than the Menu-Selection group on a concept mapping test.  The results suggest that assigning students with a concept mapping activity accompanying a CAI tutorial program is a plausible method to enhance their learning.

AB  - The Educational Materials for Organic Chemistry Project (EMOC) developed Web-based learning materials, which were accessible by students enrolled in a variety of undergraduate organic chemistry courses at a major midwestern university. EMOC was developed and implemented by the third author and had three distinct goals: (a) to develop interactive learning materials, (b) to develop interactive tools for this learning, and (c) to evaluate the students' use of these materials. This article reports the evaluation of EMOC conducted by the first and second authors. All authors jointly constructed the guidelines for the evaluation in two general areas: student attitudes towards and perceptions of the Website and students' specific learning from the Website. Initially, the Website was analyzed, and the survey and focus group instruments were developed, piloted, and revised. Next, surveys were given to students in two courses, and onsite focus groups of EMOC users and one nonuser were conducted. Attitudes toward interactive technologies on EMOC were determined by analyzing the students' responses on the initial and final surveys and the focus group discussions. Acid-base organic chemistry was chosen as a representative topic in order to probe the students' understanding of the chemistry taught in the courses and represented in the EMOC site. Students' knowledge of this chemistry was assessed by analyzing (a) the focus group participants' explanations of a graph of an acid/conjugate-base equilibrium system and (b) the concept maps of acid-base chemistry prepared by the focus group participants. We found that students' attitudes towards the Website were generally favorable and that students believed that using the site helped them learn organic chemistry. However, the contribution of EMOC to students' actual understanding of acid-base chemistry, as discussed in the focus groups, was less clear. This result was probably affected by the low level of participation in the focus groups by nonusers. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This paper describes a preservice technology course taught at the University of Victoria using the elementary science, math, and social studies curriculum as the focal point. The main goal of the course is to provide students with a model of how to teach these subjects with technology rather than just how to use technology. The content of the course includes the use of computers for discovery learning, experimentation, forming and testing conjectures, and problem solving as well as communication, information retrieval, and course management. Technology tools used to facilitate these activities include spreadsheets, databases, Hypercard/Hyperstudio, Internet (including HTML and web page construction), computer concept maps, graphics packages, computer-based lab equipment and software, CD ROM/laser disks and other multi-media, as well as some subject specific packages. Students learn by participating in sample activities in class. Assignments consist of planning classroom activities using technology. Criteria for marking assignments consists, in equal parts, of demonstrated mastery of the technology and appropriateness and quality of the planned classroom activity. The course has been very successful and is consistently rated as one of the most valuable in the teacher education program.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - Concept maps have been used extensively in science education both to promote and to measure meaningful learning.  This study examines the use of concept maps to measure tertiary science students' understanding of fundamental concepts in statistical inference. Different methods of scoring maps are examined, and a revised scheme developed.  Student scores on concept maps of two aspects of statistics, namely problem definition and statistical inference, are compared before and after a practical statistical investigation conducted by the students.  The concept map scores are also compared with marks awarded for the practical assignment.  While there was no significant improvement in concept map scores over time, some significant correlations were found between aspects of the concept map scores and scores on the practical assignment.  Valuable qualitative information can be gained from an investigation of student concept maps, which enables clarification of student misconceptions, and which cannot be obtained from traditional assessment methods.

AB  - The utilization of concept maps in the classroom is discussed. Concept maps are diagrams consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines that show the relationship between these concepts. Studies have demonstrated that these maps may be of value in science education, as a learning strategy, as an instructional strategy, as a tool in the instructional design process, and as a method of assessing a student's understanding of scientific concepts.  Despite these results, the use of student-prepared concept maps as an assessment tool is still uncommon.

AB  - Two instructional methods (teacher centered and student centered) were compared in a non-laboratory-based environmental science course for college undergraduates.  Students in 2 teacher-centered (traditional) classes (n = 46 and n = 45) were presented material in standard lecture fashion for 90 min twice a week.  Students in 2 student-centered (constructivist) classes (n = 48 and n = 42) worked in small, heterogeneous groups on thought-provoking scenarios and critical thinking questions or constructed concept maps on the information of the day; material was presented to the students in question-discussion fashion.  Identical materials, learning resources, student questionnaires, and examinations were used for both populations.  Students in constructivist classes performed significantly better on exams, rated the course higher, and participated more in campus and regional environmental support efforts than students in traditional classes.

AB  - A method used in program evaluation and public health research called concept mapping is examined in this article for its usefulness in feminist research.  This method embodies several defining characteristics of feminist social science.  Concept mapping is a single method that integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, provides an opportunity for participants to work together as a group to develop an understanding of a concept, and places the participants in control of interpretation.  Over the course of a six-step process, a group of people are assembled to discuss an issue or concept, moving toward a group understanding of that concept, which is then represented in a visual picture, or map.  Concept mapping was used in the current study to examine how community resources for sexual-assault victims could be improved.  A national random sample of 168 rape-victim advocates provided ideas as to how the legal, medical, and mental health systems could better serve victims.  A subgroup of advocates then constructed and interpreted a concept map.  The map suggested that rape victims still face many problems in seeking community help.  Twelve clusters of broad-based and specific system changes were identified (e.g., fighting victim blaming, community education, sensitizing medical staff, legal reform).  Implications for research on sexual assault and feminist research methodology are discussed.  Reprinted with the permission of Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Part of a special issue on innovations in feminist research.  A commentary on Rebecca Campbell and Deborah A. Salem's “Concept mapping as a feminist research method:  Examining the community response to rape,” which appears in this issue.  Campbell and Salem adopt the strategies of seeking to equalize the power relations between scientists and those they study and of enhancing the likelihood that the emergent findings reflect the worldviews of the participants and not those of the scientists.  By grounding their study in a public-health tradition, they have extended subjects' roles in the research process beyond that of simply being participants. Their analysis does not explore individuals' subjectivities but instead examines the collective viewpoint of rape-victim advocates. Their analysis provides a useful map of the domains of importance to rape-victim advocates, thereby providing valuable directions for policy change.

AB  - This study provides insights about how learning with hypermedia is mediated by system design and learner cognition.  Videotaped observations were made of seventh and eleventh grade students using a commercially produced instructional hypermedia system.  Analysis revealed differences among students in the paths taken, the type of nodes visited, the amount of time spent at each node, and think-aloud verbalizations.  Three profiles of hypermedia navigation emerged from the data with each style characterized by a distinct set of information processing strategies.  Analysis of the characteristics of the learners revealed that the students within each profile group had similar levels of prior knowledge, need for cognition, and self-efficacy.  Student-generated concept maps appeared to be influenced by both the organization of knowledge within the system and navigation performance.  Implications related to the design and use of hypermedia systems are considered.  Copyright 1999, Baywood Publishing Company, Inc.

AB  - We reviewed the process of using concept mapping as a methodology to teach science to RNs in a bachelor degree of nursing program in Australia.  The technique was used for two classes of students in the science unit during 1995 with work packages and independent student learning being the focus of the unit. Both instructors and students found the experience mainly positive.  It helped the students become more independent learners, have a greater confidence in their knowledge of science, and allowed their understanding of science in their practice to become more meaningful and personalized.  For the instructors it allowed them to concentrate on students with learning difficulties because they had less face-to-face teaching hours.  Major issues arising from the process related to how to balance science content and the techniques of concept mapping and how to more effectively assess the learning outcomes of the students.  Concept mapping is a useful technique to link science and nursing practice.  Not only can it be used in academic programs to teach the science underlying practice, it can be used in the clinical area to teach patients.  As a technique it works well in staff development and continuing education where the focus is on elucidating the rationale for inuring practice and providing evidence for the value of this practice.

AB  - This yearlong study was implemented in seventh-grade life science classes with the students' regular teacher serving as teacher/researcher.  In the study, a method of scoring concept maps was developed to assess knowledge and comprehension levels of science achievement.  By linking scoring of concept maps to instructional objectives, scores were based upon the correctness of propositions. High correlations between the concept map scores and unit multiple choice tests provided strong evidence of the content validity of the map scores.  Similarly, correlations between map scores and state criterion–referenced and national norm–referenced standardized tests were indicators of high concurrent validity.  The approach to concept map scoring in the study represents a distinct departure from traditional methods that focus on characteristics such as hierarchy and branching.  A large body of research has demonstrated the utility of such methods in the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes. The results of the study suggest that a concept map might be used in assessing declarative and procedural knowledge, both of which have a place in the science classroom.  One important implication of these results is that science curriculum and its corresponding assessment need not be dichotomized into knowledge/comprehension versus higher-order outcomes.

AB  - The article focuses on the use of concept maps in assessing students' declarative knowledge in the context of the science classroom. Concept mapping has been defined as a "metalearning strategy." The research base on concept mapping shows that the use of concept maps is not limited to any particular group of learners. Children as young as primary grades have been found to be capable of developing and explaining concept maps. A number of researchers have reported the successful development of concept maps by middle school-age children. A review of the literature reveals that concept maps have been used to assess or describe a variety of constructs and outcomes as well as in instruction. An examination of a small sampling of teaching methods and precollege science texts provides evidence of the increasingly important emphasis on concept maps in science teaching, particularly at the K-12 levels. The establishment of concept maps as a vehicle for assessing both declarative and procedural aspects of science knowledge is significant as it reifies the legitimacy of different domains of science learning and mitigates against the emphasis upon one aspect of learning over another.

AB  - Within a sociocultural context, this study examined how science leachers' knowledge of science and science pedagogy changed as a result of participating in a constructivist-based graduate science methods course.  Fourteen elementary and middle school science teachers worked with an assigned partner for the duration of the course.  Teachers with more than 5 years' experience were paired with teachers who had 5 or fewer years' experience.  Results from pre- and postinstruction concept maps, journals, portfolios, and transcripts of discourse revealed that within the zone of proximal development, peers, teachers' students, instructors, readings, and tools mediated the development of content and pedagogical knowledge.

AB  - This article explores teacher development as a function of being a member of a dyad in a graduate teacher education course. Through extensive analysis of peer interactions and conceptual organization, the authors probe how teachers' knowledge is organized and mediated, how concepts of science are developed, and how peers influence teachers' cognitive growth. This analysis is interpreted through two fundamental tenets of Vygotskian theory: the zone of proximal development and signs and tools as mediators of higher learning. The study supports Russian educational psychologist, Lev Vygotsky's, premise that learning is both interpsychological and intrapsychological. The ideas that began with the instructions, peers, students, and readings became internalized and appeared in journal reflections and concept maps. The effect of students on their teachers' conceptualizations of science topics was powerful. Examining students' naive conceptions and ideas appeared to free teachers from their self-consciousness and allowed them to look closely at their own conceptual understandings.

AB  - The problem addressed by this study is that first-year college chemistry students learn little of the conceptual material associated with chemistry experiments they perform.  The thesis of this research is that the construction of prelab and postlab concept maps help students understand the concepts involved in the experiments they perform.  The study was conducted using 32 non-science majors enrolled in a first-year chemistry course.  The experimental group constructed prelab and postlab concept maps, while the control group wrote essays explaining the conceptual chemistry of the four experiments used in this study.  Both groups took 25-item achievement tests 1 week after each experiment.  Prelab and postlab concept maps were scored and evaluated for significant differences.  Five students were interviewed to investigate their perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in chemistry laboratories.  No significant differences were found between treatment groups with respect to students' conceptual understanding as determined by the multiple choice achievement tests. Students responded very positively toward the use of concepts maps in the laboratory.  They felt strongly that constructing prelab and postlab concept maps helped them understand the conceptual chemistry of the experiments.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This article addresses the problem that first-year college chemistry students learn little of the conceptual material associated with chemistry experiments they perform. This study was conducted using students enrolled in Chemistry 170, during the fall 1994 semester at a small private women's college in Connecticut. This four-credit course meets for three 50-mm lectures and one 3-h lab per week. This course is predominantly taken by nursing and nutrition students during their first year, and many of these students are of nontraditional age. The course content includes topics from inorganic chemistry and organic chemistry. The results of this study indicate that learning did occur, and that there is no significant difference in the learning of conceptual chemistry as measured on achievement tests between students who write essays versus those who construct concept maps as part of their lab reports. The construction of prelab and postlab concept maps did help students understand the concepts in the experiments they performed.

AB  - The article analyzes the effect of concept mapping on achievement, self-efficacy, and anxiety toward learning and teaching physical science of elementary preservice teachers. It was found that concept mapping is a valuable tool as it helps teachers to collaboratively develop conceptual understanding of physical science. Anxiety of preservice teachers towards the subject matter is decreased through participation in collaborative concept mapping. Concept mapping was also found to be an effective strategy for use in the explanation phase of the BSCS 5 E Model of learning.

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two different types of interviews—one that did (POSTICM) and one that did not (POSTI) embed a concept-mapping process—to elicit students' postinstructional understandings about chlorofluorocarbons and their role in global atmospheric change (GAC).  A chief criterion measure was accordance, the degree to which students held the ideal postinstructional understanding set forth in a teacher-expert concept map.  After GAC instruction that included concept-mapping activities, 34 eighth-grade science students were assigned randomly to groups and completed either POSTICM or POSTI.  These students and their teacher also completed relatedness ratings of central concepts from the teacher-expert map.  The Knowledge Network Organizing Tool™ was used to transform relatedness ratings to Pathfinder networks and compare nets to yield a student to teacher similarity index (Pathfinder index).  Regression analysis revealed that type of interview did not predict accordance.  However, most POSTICM students perceived the concept-mapping interview component to be helpful and affect positively their answers to the interview questions.  The Pathfinder index did predict (p = .003) accordance—the Pathfinder index was a reliable confirmatory measure of the degree to which students held the ideal postinstructional understanding.

AB  - A naturalistic study, with two cycles of intervention, was carried out to investigate the effects of two methods of introducing concept mapping to students taking introductory subjects in genetics in an Australian university.  Some of these students' views relating to concept mapping were also investigated in the years following its introduction.  The results of this study suggest that the method of introduction can influence students' perception of concept mapping, and its potential benefit.  Although most students taking introductory subjects had taken part in the project, and many had realised the benefits of concept mapping, retrospective views of students indicated that almost none had adopted it as a regular part of study strategies. This outcome raises several questions in regard to introducing learning tools to students and, in particular, the reasons for doing so.  Reprinted with permission from Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - Four different methods of teaching a freshman-level general chemistry course were evaluated.  Cooperative learning, class discussions, concept maps, and lectures were integrated into the first year general chemistry course at Wayne State University, Detroit, Michigan, and were compared with regard to students' levels of participation using a self-report survey.  The results indicated that the class discussion encouraged the most participation but that the other 2 new types of teaching also had a significantly higher level of student involvement than the conventional lecture.  In addition, each teaching format was found to serve a different purpose for the students.  Thus, in spite of claims that student quality has deteriorated over the last few years, these findings suggest that the integration of multiple teaching techniques can improve student participation.

AB  - A study investigated whether participation in an integrated algebra and physical science course affected students' conceptual organization of the concepts examined in the context of the course.  The conceptual organization of students in an integrated algebra and physical science class (SAM9) was compared to that of students in a discipline-specific science class (PSO).  Concept mapping was used to investigate the connections students made between normally isolated mathematics and science concepts.  The results indicated that the SAM9 students, who experienced mathematics and science concepts that were intentionally and conceptually integrated, outlined more linkages between math and science terms on conceptual maps.  In addition, the SAM9 students appeared to be more conscious of the procedural connections between terms that linked the science and math content.  Compared with maps produced by students in the PSO classes, maps produced by the SAM9 students showed a more compartmentalized view of the science and math content.

AB  - The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of use of the concept mapping technique in the learning of science subjects by Arab students in a preparatory school second grade, located in the Gaza Strip.  Concept mapping is a schematic device for representing a set of concept meanings embedded in a framework of propositions.  The subjects of this study were randomly assigned to the two regularly scheduled classes, and each class was assigned to either experimental or control conditions.  In the control class, the teaching approach was primarily teacher orientated, that is the teacher used the lecturing method in sequencing the instructional activities.  In the case of the experimental class, the concept mapping approach added the generation of propositional relationships among concepts on maps, using the same content material.  The results of this study indicated that the experimental class subjects achieved better than those of the control class.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - A study investigated the patterns of talk that produce negotiated outcomes in collaborative concept mapping in the context of children's difficulty in learning science meaningfully.  Participants were three classes of year 5 and year 6 children in two schools in England who worked in mixed ability groups to produce a concept map.  Audio recordings of the talk within the groups were used as data.  Results showed that one of the most significant features of the discourse was the phenomenon of children continuing each other's contributions. Results also revealed that collaboratively elaborated exchanges were more likely to result in the incorporation of a scientifically valid proposition in a concept map, indicating that group processes were effective in maintaining a focus on scientific meaning.  The results suggest that there are significant gains to be made in students' learning through engaging in discussion of scientific ideas.

AB  - A study examined the alternative conceptions of students enrolled in a second course of sciences at the Teacher Training School in Pamplona, Spain, regarding a geological subject they had previously studied. The investigation was carried out with a group of 25 students who were trained in concept mapping techniques without receiving specific instruction in geology.  The students were asked to construct a concept map of a list of concepts pertaining to the earth's crust. The students then followed the course as usual with a conventional methodology.  Results of the investigation revealed that misconceptions about scientific concepts were very frequent, even though the students had studied the topics in previous courses. Moreover, the variety and characteristics of the misconceptions showed the idiosyncratic nature of individual knowledge and the fact that some misconceptions proved to be both persistent and tenacious.  It was apparent that the traditional instruction encouraged rote learning and did not serve to modify faulty conceptual frameworks.

AB  - The validity of several dimensions of knowledge which were inferred from concept maps was assessed for its psychometric and edumetric aspects.  Data were collected from 14 students who enrolled in the university first-year introductory geomorphology course and in its prerequisite introductory geology course.  They took an objective geomorphology test, the tree construction task, and the Standardized Concept Structuring Analysis Technique (SConSAT) version of concept mapping.  Comparisons among these dimensions of knowledge before and after the geomorphology course yielded convergent evidence.  For the psychometric perspective, the SConSAT version of concept mapping and tree construction had similar knowledge structure representations, and the cognitive map correctness was moderately positively correlated with the objective test but not with the geomorphology course test. For the edumetric perspective, the majority of the dimensions of knowledge structures from the SConSAT showed large improvements following the geomorphology course.  This evidence shows that the knowledge structure dimensions have moderate to good construct validity which warrant their widespread use for evaluating learning outcomes in both experimental and classroom settings.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge base of a group of science teachers in terms of their knowledge of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines, and their understanding of the nature of science.  The study also aimed to relate the teachers' knowledge base to their level of education, years of teaching experience, and the class level(s) that they teach. Twenty inservice science teachers were selected to respond to a modified version of the Views on Science–Technology–Society (VOSTS) questionnaire to assess their understanding of the nature of science.  The teachers then constructed concept maps and were interviewed.  The concept maps were scored and the interviews analyzed to assess teachers' knowledge of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines.  The teachers' knowledge base was found to be lacking in all respects.  Teachers held several naive views about the nature of science and did not demonstrate adequate knowledge and understanding of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines.  Moreover, the teachers' knowledge base did not relate to their years of teaching experience, the class level(s) that they teach, and their level of education.  It was reasoned that teacher preparation programs are not helping teachers develop the knowledge base needed for teaching science.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This study explored students' conceptual understanding and conceptual growth regarding classical mechanics in the natural context of a Grade-level 10 science classroom.  The purpose of the study was to determine the pervasiveness of a pattern observed in an earlier study in which learners initially gave evidence of scientifically valid knowledge structures but then returned or regressed to an earlier, primitive level of understanding.  In the current study, concept mapping and interview methods were used to capture students' construction of knowledge patterns across a survey course designed to focus on some big ideas in physics.  The analyses of mean ratings of student-generated concept maps and interview transcripts over three data collections did not consistently reveal the progression–regression patterns across the instruction as observed in the earlier study.  The students' knowledge structures remained stable across the 10 weeks and remained unchanged 4 weeks after instruction ceased, suggesting that very little construction or restructuring of knowledge was taking place, and possibly worse, that the students' existing knowledge was not challenged sufficiently to promote the construction or reconstruction process.  Implications of the alternative interpretations are discussed.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The article discusses the reconceptualization of elementary science methods course guided by the reflection orientation. It describes reflection orientation as a conceptual map for guiding instructional decisions. It explains the components of the elementary science methods course's reflection program which include reflecting on own teaching via field experiences, reflecting on expert opinions in teaching via course readings, and reflecting on others' teaching via integrated media materials. It also reminds science teachers that learning to teach science involves the clarification, confrontation, and expansion of their ideas, beliefs, and values about science teaching and learning.

AB  - A study explored the use of diagnostic instruments for ascertaining junior high school science teachers' comprehension of functional relationships within a cell.  Subjects were 81 junior high school teachers from Israel.  A concept map, especially adapted to the level expected from the subjects, was used in conjunction with two unobtrusive diagnostic game-like instruments—a lotto game and a cards game.  Results indicate that the diagnostic instruments functioned efficiently, although the lotto game produced better results than the more open cards game.  Teachers quite willingly played the games, with some adopting the method for their own teaching.  The games operated as tools for a detailed analysis of individual teachers' knowledge and meaningful understanding of different science concepts.  It is recommended that junior high school teachers be trained to consciously search for the connections and interrelations between particular concepts and principles.

AB  - The addition of active learning activities to a primarily lecture-based general education course on the environment for nonscience majors at Shippensburg University, Pennsylvania, is described.  The activities were aimed at facilitating content-specific as well as integrative understanding of the concepts being studied. Students were challenged to apply their knowledge in a meaningful way through essays, special team presentations, a garden project, drawings, and concept mapping.  Student comments about the course were very positive.  They appreciated the variety of challenges, the pace of the course, the responsibility they were given for various projects, and the opportunity to do well on tests and on the many projects.

AB  - A study investigated successive and progressive changes in the structural complexity of knowledge held by college students and how those changes are influenced by the students' primary learning mode and gender.  Introductory biology students constructed concept maps at four-week intervals through a semester, and the maps were evaluated for structural complexity and change.  The findings suggest that a large amount of knowledge restructuring occurs, that much of it is incremental, and that “radical” changes involving higher order, superordinate concepts are concentrated in the first four weeks of the semester.  The findings appear to indicate that gender may be an important mediator of meaningful learning; moreover, where gender differences occurred, they tended to favor females.  The findings also suggest that students who use active, deep information processing strategies construct more elaborate, well-differentiated knowledge structures.

AB  - The removable adhesive papers known popularly as Post-it Notes are an excellent tool for active learning.  The notes help to promote constructivist learning because they are familiar to students and, as a result, can serve to help make links between existing concepts and new ones.  The removable adhesive on the back of Post-it Notes allows them to be used in concept mapping as a group activity, in chemical modeling, in group activities that demonstrate a multistep biological process, and in convenient models of chromosomes and genes.

AB  - A classroom instruction project that was carried out on an anatomy and physiology class of 12 students in a small community college in rural western North Carolina is described.  The project concentrated more on active learning and less on rote memorization.  The course instructor changed the traditional lecture/note taking/testing format to one in which students organized their own meaning.  Included in the approach were concept maps, which students created to connect normally isolated information, and metacognitive writing assignments, which allowed students to reflect on their learning processes.  With the exception of one student, all of the students had something positive to say about their experiences with the metacognitive format.  The alternative techniques translated into success in traditional methods of assessment.

AB  - A study explored common alternative conceptions of a natural science topic—water in nature—that was part of the regular curriculum and familiar to students.  Participants were teachers and their 67 students in levels 2, 3, 5, and 8 from a public school in Pamplona, Spain.  The most applicable instruments and techniques used in the study were brainstorming sessions, transcripts of students' participation, a questionnaire on basic knowledge of the subject, and concept maps.  The results show that there were a lot of alternative and varied conceptions in students' responses, thereby illustrating the distinctive character of individual knowledge acquisition.  The results also prove that students at different levels in primary school very often hold misconceptions about science subjects.

AB  - Student-constructed concept maps can be invaluable in helping teachers to succeed in the continual assessment of student understanding. Concept maps are diagrams that portray an individual's understanding of a particular idea or topic.  Concept mapping involves selecting the concept, clustering the concept, positioning the central topic and beginning the linking of concepts, concluding the mapping of concepts, and cross-linking other relevant relationships.  As an alternative form of assessment, concept maps can be evaluated by scoring rubrics developed by the teacher.  The criteria for developing such scoring rubrics can contain parameters such as the number of relevant concepts, the number of valid propositions, branching, the number of suitable cross-links, and the number of examples of specific concepts.

AB  - A study examined the internal consistency of Novak and Gowin's scoring scheme and its effect on the prediction validity of concept mapping as an alternative science classroom achievement assessment.  Subjects were two grade 7 general science classes and two enriched classes. Data were obtained in three typical conditions:  very limited concept mapping experience with freestyle concept mapping, some concept mapping experience with questions provided, and extensive concept mapping experience with a list of concepts provided for.  The results showed that Novak and Gowin's scoring scheme was not internally consistent, and consequently, there was generally no significant correlation between students' scores on concept mapping and students' scores on conventional classroom achievement assessments.  The need for a new scoring procedure when concept mapping is employed as an alternative science assessment is discussed.

AB  - The use of concept maps (CMs) in the chemistry classroom is discussed. The CM is a tool for representing the learner's concept/prepositional framework of a domain-specific knowledge in a convenient and concise manner.  In the CM, concepts and their linking relationships are visualized as concept labels and verbal connectives to illustrate the organization of the concepts in the learner's cognitive structure.  By building successive CMs, teachers and students can elucidate the concepts already present in a student's mind (initial concepts), the conceptual linkages between the concepts (context), and the evolution that takes place as a consequence of teaching/learning activities (conceptual change).  The writers report on their experience over the past 4 years of using CMs with 16–18 year olds enrolled in the final 3 years of the chemistry specialization in a technical school.

AB  - A study examined the understandings children have of the scientific concept of light and charted the development of children's thinking about light during a two-week teaching program.  Subjects were 24 four-year-old children who took part in a sequence of activities on the concept of light at the beginning of the preschool year.  The data were used to derive concept maps.  The study found that there was a distinct progression in conceptual development for many of the children.  When compared to the second concept map, the first concept map and its accompanying transcript demonstrated the relatively limited understanding that many of the children initially had about light.  As the children had more free play experiences in the dark room and teacher input, many of them tended to broaden their range of responses and appeared able to express their understandings in a more sophisticated manner.

AB  - A commentary on an article by Nakhleh and Krajcik that appeared in Journal of Research in Science Teaching, vol. 31, 1994, pp. 1,077–1,096.  In the article, Nakhleh and Krajcik used concept maps to determine the types of representational systems comprising an individual's cognitive structure.  The writer contends that this method of analysis is unsuitable for identifying the types of representational systems used by individuals studying chemistry. Phenomenology is the customary theoretical perspective for qualitative analysis of cognitive structure and provides a purely descriptive study of the conscious experiences of thought and of knowledge. Researchers using this perspective can never be sure that their understanding of an individual's cognitive structure is the same as, or even an accurate representation of, that individual's own understanding.  Assessing representational systems directly from concept maps, as opposed to interview data, adds to the possibility of misrepresenting the participant's cognitive structure.

AB  - A response to a commentary by Domin that appeared in this issue of Journal of Research in Science Teaching.  In the commentary, Domin argued that researchers need to be aware of the possibility of imposing their own biases when interpreting concept maps and trying to assess students' use of various representational systems in chemistry. The writers agree with this opinion and assert that it is important to accurately represent students' comprehension of science concepts and the representation systems they use when discussing such concepts. The writers outline several safeguards they used to ensure that students' ideas were accurately conveyed by concept maps used in their study.  They conducted stringent reliability studies, used students' own words except in some well-defined instances, and checked the results for discrepancies and the validity of their conclusions from the concept maps.  In light of the safeguards used, the writers take exception to Domin's specific claim that the analysis of the representation systems from the concept maps may have been skewed by changing the words used by students to discuss the concepts.

AB  - The search for new, authentic science assessments of what students know and can do is well under way.  This has unearthed measures of students' hands-on performance in carrying out science investigations, and has been expanded to discover more or less direct measures of students' knowledge structures.  One potential finding is concept mapping, the focus of this review.  A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes.  A student's concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in his or her memory (cognitive structure).  In this article we characterize a concept map used as an assessment tool as:  (a) a task that elicits evidence bearing on a student's knowledge structure in a domain, (b) a format for the student's response, and (c) a scoring system by which the student's concept map can be evaluated accurately and consistently.  Based on this definition, multiple concept-mapping techniques were found from the myriad of task, response format, and scoring system variations identified in the literature.  Moreover, little attention has been paid to the reliability and validity of these variations.  The review led us to arrive at the following conclusions:  (a) an integrative working cognitive theory is needed to begin to limit this variation in concept-mapping techniques for assessment purposes; (b) before concept maps are used for assessment and before map scores are reported to teachers, students, the public, and policy makers, research needs to provide reliability and validity information on the effect of different mapping techniques; and (c) research on students' facility in using concept maps, on training techniques, and on the effect on teaching is needed if concept map assessments are to be used in classrooms and in large-scale accountability systems.

AB  - A study examined the effect that student initiated experiments would have on students' development of the concept of flotation.  Subjects were 21 students, whose average age was 15 years, 4 months, and who were enrolled in a physical science course.  They were administered a number of analytical instruments, and they drew concept maps and took part in word sorting tasks to indicate their changes in understanding in density and flotation as they designed and conducted experiments. The study suggests that there is a link between students' involvement in developing experiments and their subsequent understanding of certain facets of the concept of flotation.  The students who developed and tested their hypotheses on weight did modify alternate conceptions with regard to the relationship between weight and flotation.  Telling students what to think seems to be conceptually unproductive, as alternate concepts are usually arrived at through personal experience and previous instruction.

AB  - The use of political buttons to teach social studies students about politics is described.  Political buttons, the most commonly collected of which is the presidential political button, can be used to improve students' political understanding.  The buttons can be used for problem-solving activities, discussions of slogans for different elections, case studies of political events, the “Political Button Game,” and concept-mapping exercises.  Students can also produce their own political buttons and devise slogans for them.  Sources for obtaining and learning about political buttons are listed.

AB  - The Indiana Weather Project (IWP) investigated how the joint application of situated learning and constructivist theory might support elementary school students' understanding of weather systems. Using a number of forms of learning assistance (e.g., tool, teacher, peer, expert, and university resources), fifth- and sixth-grade students created multimedia documents and used on-line information resources in an attempt to generate excitement for science and learning.  Multimedia composition tools specifically designed for elementary students (e.g., HyperStudio) were used to turn the learning environments of three schools (one urban, one rural, and one suburban) from a focus on knowledge consumption to knowledge production.  Additionally, students were electronically exposed to a community of science practitioners as well as hundreds of peers working on the same electronic unit.  Students were, in effect, led into more authentic learning activities by merging multimedia design tools with an electronic connection to a community of practice (e.g., meteorological personnel).  Measures of knowledge structures (i.e., concept maps, similarity judgment triads, and open-ended metacognitive reflection questions) indicated significant cognitive gains during the multimedia weather unit.  In terms of teacher and school change, teacher interviews were focused on initial infrastructure issues, innovative forums for teacher collaboration across distant sites, curriculum organization, and establishing procedures for electronic interaction.  Infrastructure issues, results of cognitive assessments, and future directions are detailed.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to offer a different methodology for teaching and learning in continuing nursing education and staff development.  This article describes a qualitative research study that analyzed how linkages are made between theoretical material and clinical nursing practice.  Findings indicate that nursing students did not link the elements of nursing process together, that clinical preparation was not linked to theoretical material, that the meaning students made of the information was different than the instructors' and that concepts from the basic sciences were not incorporated into student meaning structures.  Implications for the use of concept maps as an educational strategy in continuing nursing education are drawn. Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - A lesson entitled “Scientific Literacy is a Lifetime Skill” was devised to provide thought and discussion on science as an aspect of everyday life.  The lesson involves an introductory discussion of science concepts and their value, the use of concept maps to explore relationships between formal science education and real-world situations, an explanation of scientific literacy, a discussion of newspaper examples of situations in which a scientifically literate person might possess an advantage when making a decision, and the application by students of their understanding to a real-life situation.

AB  - Concept maps were used to compare and assess how the main concepts of respiration were explained in three high school biology textbooks written especially for the English-speaking Caribbean countries.  A concept map illustrates the hierarchical relationships of ideas by depicting the levels of concepts in a graphical manner.  In the texts examined, the following major classes of defects notably reduced the quality and accuracy of the elaborations for some basic concepts of respiration:  presentation of some inaccurate data; use of misleading terms; lack of detailed explanations concerning the features and interrelationships among the concepts of gas exchange, gas exchange surface, and breathing; lack of emphasis on glucose as the fuel for respiration; and failure to stress that tracheae, lungs, gills, and leaves are the main gas exchange organs of insects, vertebrates, fish, and plants, respectively.

AB  - Part of a special section on science teaching for sustainable development.  The writer describes how concept mapping can be used to facilitate teaching and learning.  A concept map allows the structure of knowledge to be represented in a way that shows knowledge as being composed of concepts and the relationships between them, arranged in a hierarchical structure.  The concept map also takes into account the fact that knowledge is context dependent.  The approach is rooted in the process by which acquired concepts are used to learn new concepts. The concept map can facilitate the preparation of lessons, the sequencing of topics, and the sequencing of lessons; can provide a vehicle for discussion among students and between educators and students; and can be used to evaluate what student know.  Concept maps allow teachers to move away from the rote memorization of information toward the facilitation of meaningful learning.  Further discussion on preparing, applying, and evaluating concept maps is provided.

AB  - Part of a special issue on revitalizing political socialization research.  The writer examines research conducted by cognitive and developmental psychologists between the late 1970s and the mid-1990s and suggests ways in which this research may provide a new conceptualization of political socialization as a process of individual construction of knowledge located within a community of peers.  The research described suggests that there is a distinct domain covering social, political, and legal institutions in which students develop theories and concepts, and to which political scientists can make a distinct contribution.  Research involving think-aloud problem solving, concept mapping, and observation is described.

AB  - We investigated how different levels of information presented by various technologies affected secondary students' understanding of acid, base, and pH concepts.  Secondary students who were selected for the study had just completed their study of acid-base chemistry.  No attempt was made to provide further instruction.  We analyzed changes in the understanding of individual students by constructing concept maps from the propositions that the students used in interviews conducted before and after a series of acid-base titrations.  After the initial interview, students were divided into three groups. Within each group students individually performed the same set of titrations using different technologies:  chemical indicators, pH meters, and microcomputer-based laboratories (MBL).  After the titrations were completed, all students were interviewed again.  We found that students using MBL exhibited a larger positive shift in their concept map scores, which indicates a greater differentiation and integration of their knowledge of acids and bases.  The chemical indicator students exhibited a more moderate positive shift in their concept map scores, and the pH meter students exhibited a smaller positive shift.  We also found that the MBL students constructed more inappropriate links in their concept maps than the chemical indicator or pH meter students.  However, we speculate that this increased number of inappropriate links indicates a high level of involvement with the technology.  We therefore argue that the level of information offered by the technology affected students' understanding of the chemical concepts.  Reprinted by permission of the publisher.

AB  - This study examined variation in the organization of domain-specific knowledge by 50 Year-12 chemistry students and 4 chemistry teachers. The study used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the Pathfinder network-generating algorithm to investigate individual and group differences in student concepts maps about chemical equilibrium.  MDS was used to represent the individual maps in two-dimensional space, based on the presence or absence of paired propositional links.  The resulting separation between maps reflected degree of hierarchical structure, but also reflected independent measures of student achievement.  Pathfinder was then used to produce semantic networks from pooled data from high and low achievement groups using proximity matrices derived from the frequencies of paired concepts.  The network constructed from maps of higher achievers (coherence measure = 0.18, linked pairs = 294, and number of subjects = 32) showed greater coherence, more concordance in specific paired links, more important specific conceptual relationships, and greater hierarchical organization than did the network constructed from maps of lower achievers (coherence measure = 0.12, linked pairs = 552, and number of subjects = 22).  These differences are interpreted in terms of qualitative variation in knowledge organization by two groups of individuals with different levels of relative expertise (as reflected in achievement scores) concerning the topic of chemical equilibrium.  The results suggest that the technique of transforming paired links in concept maps into proximity matrices for input to multivariate analyses provides a suitable methodology for comparing and documenting changes in the organization and structure of conceptual knowledge within and between individual students.

AB  - Part of a special issue on the reading—science learning—writing connection.  A study investigated the potential of students' writing to demonstrate changes in thinking during science lessons.  The study was conducted in an inner-city middle school, and it followed the conceptual changes shown in 25 students' writing over a 12-week science unit.  Six target students completed paper-and-pencil pretests and posttests on the nature of matter and physical change.  When patterns of conceptual change for the target students were identified, the remaining students' conceptual maps for similar patterns were analyzed.  As the lessons progressed, students' writing showed changes in central concepts, complexity, and organization.  The study demonstrates the usefulness of students' writing and concept mapping for assessing and detecting students' conceptual changes.  Students' writing can provide teachers with one window into students' thinking.

AB  - The writers present 13 discrepant event demonstrations on various concepts related to density.  The demonstrations provide an exciting, minds-on introduction to chemistry and physics and capture the attention of middle-school students.  Although these demonstrations can be used singly or at any point in the curriculum, it is effective to use the diagnostic concept mapping and the 5E instructional model—engagement, exploration, explanation, elaboration, and evaluation—because it provides a systematic method for presenting the demonstrations.  Definitions of each of the five stages of the 5E instructional model and detailed outlines of each demonstration are provided.

AB  - A study examined the use of concept maps as a tool for research into the nature of student learning and the evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching.  Students taking a history of science course through distance learning were asked to generate concept maps and to describe the nature of the links between the concepts after they had studied an introductory unit on quantum mechanics.  The unit authors completed a similar exercise to provide an expert concept map.  Analysis of the maps and a comparison with the authors' map showed that the students had failed to identify ‘radiation’ as a central concept and to make links between concepts that were considered essential by the author.  An inspection of the teaching materials revealed that ‘radiation’ as a central concept was not directly explained.  The study confirmed the usefulness of concept maps as a tool for evaluation and research and their potential for development as qualitative measures of learning.

AB  - A microbiology unit for middle-school students includes growing microorganisms and introducing students to important science concepts. Parents and students should be informed a week beforehand about the potential hazards involved in growing microorganisms.  Prior to the activity, students should observe and hypothesize about unusual growth on samples of moldy fruit, bread, leaves, and mildewed cloth.  Concept mapping should be used to assess students' prior knowledge of microorganisms and their growth.  Students can then create the nutrient medium, collect the microorganisms from various sources, inoculate the medium, grow microorganism cultures, observe the cultures, and discuss their observations.  The activity shows that microorganisms are real and omnipresent; that they need food, air, water, and space to grow; that the growth of the microorganism colonies can be affected by environmental factors; and that microorganisms can be helpful and/or harmful.

AB  - A study explored the type and frequency of conceptual difficulties faced by college biology students in understanding the processes of cellular respiration.  Concept maps, clinical interviews, and an open-ended testing instrument were used to gather viewpoints from 100 novice biology students, both before and after relevant instruction, and from 100 experienced students in advanced courses.  Results suggest that novices hold a wide range of misconceptions about cellular respiration and that many of these problems persist, and new ones arise, after instruction.  These conceptual problems often remain among advanced students despite repeated instruction.  The authors conclude that common instructional practices need rethinking.

AB  - A study investigated the science and natural resource concepts held by children across several ecological crises.  Interviews based on concept maps about marine resource management, acid rain, and pollution were conducted with 467 students in the 4th, 8th, and 11th grades from 41 schools.  Results indicated that students learn a few basic science and natural resource concepts in the elementary grades relevant to current ecological crises, that there is relatively little assimilation of new science concepts or differentiation of existing concepts between students at each grade level, and that the level of understanding of basic concepts related to ecosystems dynamics, resource use, management, and decision-making processes was low. Student understanding becomes progressively more abstract in the higher grades.  The writer concludes that an effective science curriculum should include a set of organized experiences that will aid students in developing knowledge and awareness about the environment.

AB  - A study examined the use of collaborative concept mapping for the construction of meaning in the classroom.  Data were gathered over two years in a private college preparatory school from students in either a junior level introductory physics course or a senior level second-year physics course in which collaborative concept mapping was regularly used as a summary, review, and integration activity. Videotapes of concept-mapping sessions, concept maps produced both at these sessions and individually at home, students' reflective essays, and the teacher's reflective notes were analyzed using an interpretive method rooted in constructivism.  Results indicate that the concept map became a conscription device that engaged students and teachers alike in an extended discourse toward the integration/reconstruction of knowledge.  The teacher had a more peripheral role than in traditional instruction but took on a new role as a coach, guide, or facilitator of learning.

AB  - The effects of changes in students' conceptual knowledge of photosynthesis on their study strategies and achievement and on course context were investigated.  Students' understanding of photosynthesis, before and after studying it in a general biology course, were evaluated using concept maps.  Their study strategies were categorized in terms of a surface strategy that involved rote learning, a deep strategy in which students tried to understand new material, and an achieving strategy that was used for maximizing assessment grades.  A prompted hierarchical concept mapping task determined their knowledge structure.  Multiple choice questions were used to examine achievement.  Over the course period, the students' conceptual knowledge was found to be fairly stable.  It is concluded that in setting a course context, teachers should encourage students to try to understand significant science concepts as opposed to learning superficially or by rote.

Chemistry teachers often find that students may preform well on examination questions while not acquiring routine problem-solving skills.  The maps were based on the idea that the building blocks of knowledge are concepts and concept relationships. The study indicated the importance of active student participation in a meaningful learning process, which is distinct from learning by rote.  It was concluded that correct answers do not necessarily reflect an understanding of the subject and that concept maps may be used to illustrate changes in a student's conceptual understanding and to bring about meaningful learning.

AB  - The article focuses on the contributions of Leopold Klopfer to the field of science education as an editor of Science Education from 1979 to 1993. During his tenure as editor, the field of science education and science educational research has undergone dynamic changes. Personally, he helped to pioneer the use of historical cases of science in secondary programs. With William Cooley, he helped developed and validates the widely used Test on Understanding Science. He also participated in some of the earliest investigations of misconceptions research and the use of concept maps as dependent measures of student learning in science. Under his leadership the journal installed sections and section editors, a policy decision that improved the quality of manuscripts published. The journal has sustained an affiliation with the Association for the Education of Teachers of Science and hence has continued to be an important voice in science education research community.

AB  - This article presents an investigation of the effectiveness of concept mapping as an instructional tool in science education. It is inferred that the impact of concept mapping on achievement and attitudes is based upon using teacher-prepared maps and those created by student concept-mapping activities. A metaanalysis of the instructional tool showed that the concept mapping had medium positive effects on students' achievement and large positive effects on students' attitudes. Improved achievement was more evident in studies which used biology as their content focus.

AB  - Concept mapping and vee diagramming are metalearning tools that have recently appeared on the science education scene. Literature attesting to their metacognitive potentials for students provide reason for optimism regarding their use for tackling rote memorization of scientific concepts. Are teachers who are key agents in the diffusion process of an educational innovation positively disposed towards these new metalearning tools? This is the broad question addressed in this study. The first phase of the study resulted in the development and validation of an instrument — the Attitude towards Concept- and Vee-Mapping Inventory (ACVMI). The second phase involved the use of this instrument to collect data for answering two major research questions. Data obtained from 48 biology, 36 chemistry, 24 physics and 33 mathematics teachers who had been trained in and had used the two tools showed a largely favourable attitude towards learning the techniques and using them in teaching science rather than mathematics. Both science and mathematics teachers expressed views favouring both metalearning tools in terms of their benefits in the areas of meaningful learning and reduction of anxiety levels. A few questions were tackled in the study and some more questions surfaced. One of these is the observed poor attitude of mathematics teachers towards vee mapping. The other is how to assist teachers in teaching both concept mapping and vee mapping such that they can gain greater confidence, especially with teaching vee mapping in science and mathematics classrooms. Research focused on these and related questions is eagerly awaited. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article discusses the social construction of knowledge when students are engaged in collaborative concept mapping and develops a framework for understanding concept maps from a sociologically informed point of view. It is suggested that the psychology-based conceptualization may have been appropriate for individual concept mapping, but does not provide for an appropriate framework for the collaborative construction of concept maps or the function of maps in the interaction. The concept map used as a tool for social thinking, a conscription device, and an inscription method helps in planning for group experiences and in working to better adapt the heuristic for interactive classrooms.

AB  - This article presents a summary of research on science education reviewed in 1990. The studies dealt with questions about students' prior knowledge, understanding how conceptual change occurs, teaching strategies, concept mapping and factors that influence student conceptions or achievement. In the area of physical science, students' views on the second law of thermodynamics were investigated. In life science, scientific principles on marine science and natural resources were explored. There were also studies which assessed the effectiveness of two alternative instructional units in helping students change their initial conceptions about the nature and structure of matter and molecules. In another study of college non-science majors, students were tested to reveal their conceptions of respiration and photosynthesis before and after course instruction.

AB  - This article discusses a study on the use of concept mapping as a tool to help potential science teachers to reflect upon their own knowledge base of science and science learning. Concept maps were evaluated for understanding the nature of science, condensing scientific information, determining the effectiveness of presentations, identifying misconceptions, and recognizing learning styles. The subjects in this study were science majors. These courses, based on Sulman's Model of Pedagogical Reasoning and Action, focused on content-specific teaching and learning.

AB  - The article focuses on the effectiveness of conceptual change in teaching chemistry to community college students. The study found that cooperative work on concept-focused tasks can provide an environment for adult learners to overcome misconceptions in chemistry. Moreover, the students' behavior depict an inclination of possible conceptual change. Furthermore, good leadership is discovered to promote fast learning to students. Therefore, it is recommended that good leadership should be taught to students.

AB  - Schema theory and research from cognitive psychology have been applied fruitfully in science education over the last decade. Their implications for improving social studies education are drawn, in particular identifying key ideas, using graphic concept maps in instruction, and assessing students' prior knowledge and its connections. A conceptualization of differences between children of different ages according to the characteristics of their cognitive structures and processes is suggested. Anticipated difficulties with the approach as a whole are also outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Audio-tutorial science lessons were provided to 191 first and second grade children (instructed), and interviews were conducted periodically to assess changes in science concept understanding from grades one through twelve. A similar sample (n = 48,) not receiving audio-tutorial lessons in grades one and two (uninstructed) was also interviewed periodically from grades one through twelve, instructed students showed substantially more valid concept understandings and fewer invalid concepts (misconceptions) than uninstructed students in grades two, seven, ten, and twelve. Concept maps prepared from interview transcripts showed wide variation in knowledge for both groups, and concept maps scored using a scoring algorithm also showed significant differences favoring instructed students. The data show the lasting impact of early instruction in science and the value of concept maps as a representational tool for cognitive developmental changes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article focuses on the application of several concepts and principles from cartography to concept mapping. It discusses the application of the metaphor of maps for representing scientific knowledge. Concept maps are maps of cognition. The article offers suggestions for using concept mapping in science classrooms. Cartography offers many opportunities for creativity. Old world maps help one to understand the thoughts of past generations. Concept maps involve the creation of a mental map of various concepts one has learned.

AB  - This article discusses the development of concept mapping as an important tool for science education. There was a debate in the science education community during the 1960s as to whether young children could understand abstract scientific concepts or not. It has been found that primary grade students have the ability to develop very thoughtful concept maps. The main challenge that science educators face is how to design better instructional material. Concept mapping helps teachers to become more effective teachers.

AB  - This article examines whether concept mapping reduces anxiety in learning and thereby enhances achievement in the study of biology. A total of 51 tenth grade students of the Ahmadu Bello University Demonstration Secondary School in Zaria, Nigeria, participated in this study. The Biology Achievement Test was used to measure the achievement of the students. It was found that concept mapping is much more effective than traditional teaching methods in enhancing the study of biology. It also seems to reduce students' anxiety regarding the study of biology.

Conceptual knowledge comprised several variables such as disciplinary validity, congruence, salience, quality of concept groups and central concepts. The knowledge structure dimensions found with the help of concept mapping are unique as compared to traditional achievement tests.

It also compares concept mapping and semantic networking. Computer-based semantic networking has been made possible by using SemNet. This software has been developed by SemNet Research Group. It was introduced in college biology classrooms during the year 1987. Semantic networks enable one to capture various experiences and perceptions in the form of words. They capture each concept's position in psychological space.

AB  - This article presents information about the SemNet computer software. It discusses some of its uses as an educational and research tool. It also compares concept mapping and semantic networking. Computer-based semantic networking has been made possible by using SemNet. This software has been developed by SemNet Research Group. It was introduced in college biology classrooms during the year 1987. Semantic networks enable one to capture various experiences and perceptions in the form of words. They capture each concept's position in psychological space.

AB  - n this study, concept mapping was assessed as an instructional strategy for use by high school students in learning biology concepts. Concept mapping, which requires learners to plot concepts and their interrelations in a meaningful organizational network, was compared with an established curriculum approach and tested in an interaction with learners of varying verbal ability. The design emphasized external validity. As hypothesized, concept mapping facilitated low-ability learners’ performance, but only on higher level, relational knowledge. The usefulness of the technique was discussed in terms of its ability to individualize and raise the quality of learning with little extra effort or resource costs to the instructional system.

AB  - Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldylocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be ‘too big’ (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers' self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and non inferential ways of assessing teacher belief (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers' descriptive language, (c) taxonomic for assessing self-reflection and meta cognition, (d) multi method evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process-product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article investigates the use of concept mapping in college autotutorial biology students over a three instructional unit exposure, as well as, the student attitudes toward concept mapping. The study shows that concept mapping appeared to enhance clarity of learning as supported by two error analyses and student claims. Further, mapping also seemed to enhance integration and retention of knowledge as supported by analysis of cross links, a comparison of student maps with initial and post interviews, and student claims. In addition, this study provides some evidence that meaningful learning enhanced usability of knowledge.

AB  - The article focuses on the study about the use of representational diagram systems such as concept mapping as student assessment techniques. In this regard, researchers have shown the relationship between student concept mapping and achievement in which they found that the skill in concept mapping predicted success on an achievement test among students in a college natural resources class. Further, the study also investigates the use of concept mapping in conjunction with science instructional laboratories in which the effects of concept mapping have not been reported.

AB  - The article investigates the effect of the concept mapping on achievement of high school physics students in the U.S. Six intact high school physics classes took part in the study. Two of these six classes were control groups and received standard instruction. The other four classes received weeks of concept mapping instruction prior to the unit under study. Two of these four classes were the low-level treatment group and were required to submit concept maps at the end of the instruction. The other two classes were the high-level treatment group and were required to submit concept maps at the start and end of the unit under study. As measured by posttest scores, mapping concepts prior to, during, and subsequent to instruction led to greater achievement.

AB  - In a study of college physics and sociology textbook publishers, coercive, mimetic, and normative forces in the institutional environment are shown to order the decision and access structures of garbage can systems and to account for a uniformity of outcomes that is unexpected from garbage can decision models. Interviews with editors established that decision making in textbook publishing conforms with the garbage can model and helped us determine the ten best-selling introductory texts in each field. Optimal matching, a quantitative technique for content analysis, was used to demonstrate that differences in the homogeneity of contents and sequencing of material in these textbooks are determined by the degree of development of paradigms in the academic discipline. We show that, in contrast to Thompson's (1967) model, organizations with ambiguous core technologies can benefit from opening their technical cores to be shaped by the institutional environment [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The article discusses the role of metaphor in science and suggests that when metaphors are used correctly they can greatly enhance the fulfillment of certain educational goals. In positive look, metaphor is seen as a decorative form of literal description, a relieving side show and a disguised joke. The figurative language enriches the perspective of those theorists in science education. Bringing it into the curriculum can provide the student with an overall frame of reference, or "concept map" for making sense of the world--that is putting what is known into a pattern that can easily be received and comprehended.

AB  - The article presents an investigation on cognitive preference and learning mode as determinants of meaningful learning through concept mapping in science. Concept mapping appears to be a promising strategy for arresting performance of students. Cognitive preference is an individual's stable mode of perceptual organization and conceptual categorization of the external environment. The study entailed that the cognitive preference and learning mode served as mediating factors that promote meaningful learning.

AB  - The article presents the results of a project that studied the effectiveness of two specific learning heuristics, concept mapping and Vee mapping, conceptual means of representing concepts and their interrelationships, in helping African American high school students learn biology concepts meaningfully. Instructional treatments were compared utilizing the two instructional heuristics as study aids and outlining as a comparison study aid. The subjects of the study were 250 subjects from two urban high schools in Indiana. Based on the results, suggestions have been made on the tendency toward an effect of the experimental treatment. Moreover, the results identified several factors contributing to the difficulty in distinguishing achievement differences.

AB  - The article describes the use of concept mapping and knowledge vee mapping in teaching science to students. Concept maps provide methods to illustrate a specific information using individual's creativity in drawing. A vee map is one way to help science students to interpret what they have discovered in experiments. However, questions arise as to whether seventh and eighth grade students know how to use these strategies in connection with regular science programs and whether their science knowledge and problem solving abilities will be changed because of the strategies' instruction.
