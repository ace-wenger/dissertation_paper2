AB  - We used concept-mapping methods to gain insights into promising HIV prevention intervention strategies from the collective experience of heterosexual Black men (HBM) in four cities of Ontario. We engaged 60 HBM in online group concept-mapping sessions. First, we held a brainstorming session where the HBM generated 226 statements anonymously on strategies to reduce HIV vulnerabilities. The statements were condensed to 123. Second, the HBM (n = 45) sorted the 123 statements into self-created categories. Third, the HBM rated the strategy statements by importance (n = 45) and feasibility (n = 41). Finally, cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling were used to describe data patterns. The statements cluster tagged "family and individual level interventions" had the highest mean rating in importance (4.061) and feasibility (3.610). The policy interventions cluster solution was rated second highest in importance (IR = 4.058) and the sixth in feasibility (FR = 3.413). Other cluster solutions ratings were addressing racism (third highest in importance [IR = 4.030] and fourth highest in feasibility [FR = 3.514]); healthcare, research, and economic opportunities (fourth highest in importance [IR = 4.018] and third highest in feasibility [FR = 3.526]); sexual health awareness strategies (fifth highest in importance [IR = 3.993] and highest in feasibility [FR = 3.611]) and sex/HIV education (sixth highest in importance [IR = 3.975] and fifth highest in feasibility [FR = 3.442]); and individual and community empowerment (lowest in importance [IR = 3.846] and lowest in feasibility [FR = 3.375]). Intergenerational (family and individual), policy, and anti-racism interventions are the top three priority strategies for HIV prevention and care for HBM and communities in Ontario.

AB  - In conventional digital game-based learning, geographic maps are generally used to provide students with the whole picture of the gaming contexts, while the concepts to be learned are separately presented as individual gaming objects. Scholars have indicated the problems of such a gaming content design, in which students could encounter difficulties making effective connections between spatial and conceptual knowledge during the learning process, which may influence their learning effectiveness. As a result, it is a crucial and challenging issue to assist students in organizing spatial and conceptual knowledge in contextual learning environments, such as digital games. To solve this problem, an integrated concept map and geographic map-based digital gaming (CM-GMDG) approach is proposed to demonstrate how spatial and conceptual knowledge can be connected in the development of digital games. To investigate the effectiveness of the approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a social science course. Two classes of seventh graders in a high school participated in this study. The experimental group (N = 39) adopted the CM-GMDG approach while the control group (N = 23) adopted the conventional geographic map-based digital gaming (GMDG) approach. The results showed that the students using the CM-GMDG approach significantly outperformed those using the GMDG approach on learning achievement. Moreover, the learning behavioral pattern analysis results showed that compared with the control group, students in the experimental group more frequently engaged in knowledge-acquiring behaviors, such as reading learning materials and completing learning tasks. On the other hand, the control group gave up on the learning tasks more frequently by switching the gaming scenes and stopping answering questions. This indicated that the CM-GMDG approach was more helpful for guiding students to focus on their learning tasks than the GMDG approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Forests, commonly viewed as the Earth's lungs, play a crucial role in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, regulating the globe, and maintaining ecological equilibrium. The assessment of aboveground biomass (AGB) serves as a pivotal indicator for evaluating forest quality. By integrating remote sensing images with a small number of ground-measured samples to map, forest AGBs can significantly reduce time and labor costs. Current research mainly focuses on improving the accuracy of mapping forest AGBs, such as integrating multiple-sensors remote sensing data and models. However, due to uncertainties associated with remote sensing images and complexities inherent in forest structures, the accuracy of mapping forest AGBs is constrained by both the quantity and distribution of ground samples available. The development of transfer learning methods can fully utilize ground-based measurement data and enable the application of samples across regions and time. To evaluate the potential of transfer learning methods in mapping forest AGBs, this study conducted a spatial–temporal transfer of spectral variables (SVs) and prediction models (PMs) using a direct-push transfer method, and a new evaluation metric, relative change of R-squared (RCRS), was proposed to assess the transferability of SVs and PMs. The results showed that the transferability of SVs and PMs in the spatial target domain is obviously greater than that in the temporal target domain. Compared to the temporal target domain, the RCRS for transfer SVs in the spatial target domain was lower by 20.89 (oak) and 20.88 (Chinese fir) and for transfer PMs by 24.16 (oak) and 24.79 (Chinese fir). Tree species is also one of the main factors affecting the spatial and temporal transfer of SVs, and it is challenging to transfer SVs between different tree species. The results also show that nonparametric models have better generalization performance, and their transferability is much greater than that of parametric models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract This paper aims to contribute to the field of knowledge surrounding Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) curricula with a view to filling a gap in ESD literature by identifying features that may help ESD course designers. The study asks the questions: what is taught in ESD courses in higher education? and what content do students say they like? Working within the constructivist tradition, this study involved two groups of participants: 13 ESD design/delivery participants from six universities based in five countries (Group One) and 737 ESD students (Group Two) from three of those universities. The overarching methodology of comparative analysis was used to address the research questions. Data collection included course learning materials, participant questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and feedback on teaching. Group One data was analysed using comparative/descriptive analysis and reflexive thematic analysis was used for Group Two data. The methods were complementary to de/reconstruct data for comparability of features. NVivo software was employed to acquire results which are presented visually using tables and concept maps. The study identifies common content taught in stand-alone ESD courses and makes recommendations for course modelling based on Group One data contributions and what content Group Two say they like. The recommendations are presented as seven categories of consolidated curricular themes including science and sustainability based, contextually relevant, and futures hope. Consideration is given to student internal/external motivational domains and possible connection to curricular themes. Recommendations are practical and flexible, not prescriptive. The original contribution to knowledge lies in suggestions for ESD course content. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research shows that improved scientific reasoning and application of concepts occurred when creating and viewing student-crafted digital storytelling projects. By utilizing digital storytelling projects to showcase course competencies in an undergraduate biology course, students were able to apply subject matter outside the classroom. In this post hoc analysis of pretest and posttest scores from a two-year Florida college, significant results with medium effect sizes were shown for classes engaged in digital storytelling projects. It was determined that age was not a significant factor. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Personal care products (PCPs) contain many different compounds and are a source of exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including phthalates and phenols. Early-life exposure to EDCs commonly found in PCPs has been linked to earlier onset of puberty. To characterize the human and animal evidence on the association between puberty-related outcomes and exposure to PCPs and their chemical constituents and, if there is sufficient evidence, identify groups of chemicals and outcomes to support a systematic review for a class-based hazard or risk assessment. We followed the OHAT systematic review framework to characterize the human and animal evidence on the association between puberty-related health outcomes and exposure to PCPs and their chemical constituents. Ninety-eight human and 299 animal studies that evaluated a total of 96 different chemicals were identified and mapped by key concepts including chemical class, data stream, and puberty-related health outcome. Among these studies, phthalates and phenols were the most well-studied chemical classes. Most of the phthalate and phenol studies examined secondary sex characteristics and changes in estradiol and testosterone levels. Studies evaluating PCP use and other chemical classes (e.g., parabens) had less data. This systematic evidence map identified and mapped the published research evaluating the association between exposure to PCPs and their chemical constituents and puberty-related health outcomes. The resulting interactive visualization allows researchers to make evidence-based decisions on the available research by enabling them to search, sort, and filter the literature base of puberty-related studies by key concepts. This map can be used by researchers and regulators to prioritize and target future research and funding to reduce uncertainties and address data gaps. It also provides information to inform a class-based hazard or risk assessment on the association between phthalate and phenol exposures and puberty-related health outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although much research exists of students' alternative conceptions about evolution and natural selection, the way in which these vary in time and how scientific explanations change during instruction remains to be described and understood. Therefore, the main objective of this research is to characterise the nature of the change in student thinking about evolution through the mechanism of natural selection during a six-lesson intervention with a group of ninth-grade students (14–15 years old) from a private subsidised school in Chile. The study group included thirteen students to whom a pre- and post-test was applied using the questionnaire Assessment of Contextual Reasoning about Natural Selection (ACORNS), and from whom short tasks were collected at the end of three lessons. The data were analysed using a quantitative and qualitative analysis of nine students grouped in five cases of study. The main patterns described here are the recurrence of the design teleology thinking in students, the initial use of key concepts such as mutation, survival, and differential reproduction during the trajectories, the abundance of mixed thinking during and at the end of the instruction, and the low coherence in the structure of thinking, both in time and through the different contexts analysed.

AB  - Lunar soils will be an important feedstock for multiple space resource utilization applications including preparing sites for infrastructure, extracting metals, and manufacturing products. On Earth, soil classification systems provide a logical way to categorize different soils and are applied in soil surveys for development projects. However, these systems and others used for soil science are not appropriate to translate to the Moon because of fundamental differences in soil properties, especially clay and moisture content. Here, I propose a lunar soil classification system based on practical space resource use cases. The system includes bulk elemental composition and particle size distribution as its main variables to form 9 soil groups and can be extended with tags that represent additional properties like glass content or other mineral/elemental components. The system is designed to be simple to apply: classification criteria can be measured with in-situ instruments as well as remote sensing. Proof of concept maps are developed globally, and the Apollo 17 sample collection is used as ground truth for orbital-derived classifications over the Taurus-Littrow valley. The different soil groups are expected to perform better or poorer for specific use cases. For example, coarse grained soils will have higher flowability and higher compressibility that are important for excavation and conveyance. Mare composition soils will have lower melting points and are enriched in FeO and TiO 2 as sources of iron and titanium. Adopting a simple, standardized classification scheme will improve communication between different players for assessing resources, developing and testing hardware, and eventually selling raw and refined lunar materials. • A lunar soil classification scheme is proposed for space resource utilization. • The scheme is easy to apply by measuring bulk iron content and particle size. • Soils in different groups will fare better or worse for practical applications.

AB  - Evolution by natural selection and adaptation are core concepts in biology that students must see and correctly understand their meaning. However, using these concepts in evidence-based learning strategies in the classroom is a difficult task. Here, we present a 5E lesson plan to address the Next Generation Science Standards performance expectation HS-LS4-4, to "construct an explanation based on evidence for how natural selection leads to adaptation of populations." The Functional Frogs lesson provides multiple hands-on activities to engage students in the development of hypotheses, collection and analysis of empirical data on frog swimming, presentation of results, and construction of explanations supported by evidence for the results. The lesson's central idea is for students to understand the trait values that provide an advantage in the aquatic environment, increasing a frog's survival. The link between morphological changes and survival is used to explain how natural selection acts on populations, leading to adaptive evolution. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We discuss the perceptions and experiences of high school students using reflective writing and labatorials to attempt to understand Newtonian concepts of force and motion. The sequencing and content of these activities are centered on targeting students' key difficulties related to forces and motion. Participants are 210 secondary 5 (grade 11) students, from three private schools in Montreal, who took a physics course during 2017–2018 or 2018–2019. Their ideas and opinions about forces and learning physics were investigated prior to and following the study with (a) three questions from the Force Concept Inventory; (b) a concept map focused on the relations between force and motion, and (c) pre- and post-semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 participants. The gathered data and interviews indicate that the process of combining labatorials with reflective writing improves students' attitudes towards learning the subject. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is an increasing need for innovative educational methods that can motivate and engage students in subjects that are often perceived as difficult or boring. One such approach is the UPCT-Bloopbusters educational project, developed by a group of professors at the Universidad Politécnica de Cartagena (UPCT), Spain, wherein concepts from the fields of physics and technology are presented and exemplified in the classroom through scenes from different movies in conjunction with experiments. The project was conducted on three subjects, one from each of the three bachelor of electrical engineering degree programs offered at the UPCT, namely Physics I, Applied Physics, and Optical Communications. This paper describes the methodology of the educational project and then presents and discusses the academic results of the students involved in terms of success and performance rates both before and after the application of the new methodology. Moreover, the results of a survey carried out on the students are presented. Finally, some of the exercises used in this methodology for the teaching and learning of science based on different movie scenes are provided as examples. The results of the project show that the students were receptive of the methodology and further indicated that it may lead to increased academic performance due to their enhanced understanding of physics and technology concepts.

AB  - Physics education has been identified as one of the public sectors that are mostly influenced by technological developments. This paper adopted the quasi-experimental pre- and post-test design to assess the effects of multimedia-aided technologies (MAT) on undergraduate students' performance in quantum physics (QP) at the University of Rwanda College of Education (UR-CE). The researcher used purposive sampling to get 385 undergraduate students. Participants were randomly allocated into experimental (group A) and control (group B) groups. Group A (187 students) students were taught selected topics of quantum physics (blackbody radiation, photoelectric effect, Compton effect, wave aspects of particles, De Broglie's hypothesis, diffraction, interference and double-slit experiment, model of the atom, uncertainty relations, wave function, and Schrodinger equations) for 6 weeks using multimedia-aided technologies and engage, predict, observe, and explain (EPOE) method, whereas group B (187 students) was taught same topics during the same period with a lecture method. The results of ANCOVA revealed that the group's performance was the same (p >.05) before learning with no effect size (.000), while they diverged after learning with different teaching interventions. The significance was very high and statistically different (p <.001) with a large effect size (>.5). This implies that students taught with multimedia-aided technologies (experimental group) outperformed those students taught with lecture teaching methods (control group). Thus, the study recommends that educators should adapt teaching using MAT and EPOE strategy not only in QP but also in other domains of physics to improve active engagement, understanding levels, and academic achievement.

AB  - Student perceptions toward homework assigned in general chemistry courses was investigated in this study. The study participants were required to complete homework assignments using two different online systems, ALEKS (adaptive-responsive system) and Sapling (traditional-responsive system). An online survey investigating their general perceptions of homework was administered at the beginning of the semester, and after the participants had completed most of the course, another survey was administered toward the end of the semester exploring their perceptions of both homework systems used in the course. We found that most students believed homework was important to their performance in the course. Our results also showed that students' prior experience in high school science classes had an impact on their perceptions of the amount and the frequency of homework they expected in their general chemistry course. In general, students perceived ALEKS to be a more effective tool for preparing exams, however they also complained that the system was more time-consuming compared to Sapling. For CHEM 1, we did not see a significant change in students' performance based on their homework system preference. In conclusion, students believed homework was a tool to help them learn the subject matter better, and they generally had positive perceptions toward both online homework systems.

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how pre- and in-service teachers (N = 346) evaluate different learning strategies for six scenarios, and how they justify their answers. Results showed that teachers mostly evaluate strategies found to be effective in previous empirical studies as more effective and they can provide proper scientific justifications, though some justifications included misconceptions. Teachers were most confused when comparing interleaving versus blocking and retrieval versus concept mapping. Configural frequency analysis showed that justifications were generally, but not always, consistent with evaluations. These findings refer to the importance of examining teacher knowledge both with evaluations and with open-end questions. Misconceptions identified by justifications comprise useful information for planning teacher-training courses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Electrochemistry, a key topic in introductory chemistry, is a topic that many students struggle with conceptually. Visual learning tools like concept maps allow the externalization of key concepts and the relationships between these concepts may aid in students' acquisition and retention of newly learned electrochemistry concepts. Partnering with a general chemistry instructor, this study explored the effectiveness of two concept map formats—fill‐in‐the‐concepts and student‐corrected maps, on electrochemistry outcomes with undergraduate general chemistry students. To examine students' engagement with these maps, we also explored the role of students' interest. Results indicated that prior knowledge and map condition were significant predictors of students' electrochemistry performance. Specifically, the fill‐in‐the‐concepts condition resulted in better learning outcomes than the map correction condition. Furthermore, students with a higher interest in electrochemistry were more likely to perform well on their respective concept mapping activities, thus, scoring higher on the posttest. These findings suggested that concept maps can effectively represent key concepts of a challenging topic, and are beneficial for students' learning and retention of information. Importantly, instructors may further support learning by providing scaffolds in the form of fill‐in‐the‐concept maps to help students better organize their mental structures and identify misconceptions.

AB  - We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging "math" and "learning". These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between 'maths"/"physics" and key motivational aspects of learning ("fun", "work", "failure") in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge "maths" and "fun" only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers' mindset stream, which rather bridges "math" and "fun" through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge "maths" and "physics" to "work" through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students' mindset streams of "failure" and "math"/"physics" are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate "failure" and "math"/"physics" in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning. We discuss our findings and future research directions in view of relevant psychology/education literature. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim. The objective of this article is to describe our innovative competency-based approach to teaching nursing students about the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Background. Nurse educators require resources about pedagogical approaches related to ANS instruction. Design and Methods. We implemented an approach based on Kolb's Experiential Learning Theory, which was piloted in several nursing courses that spanned undergraduate and graduate levels of education. Results. We organized content according to three core ANS concepts: receptors and ligands; neurotransmission; and ANS divisions and reflexes. After students demonstrated mastery of these concepts, we introduced active-learning exercises, such as case studies, interactive games, concept mapping, and simulation-based education. This approach layered clinically-relevant information upon the core concepts. We leveraged student feedback by adding historical, social science, and literary examples into lectures because students reported how this approach made the material engaging. Conclusion. Our approach guides students toward a conceptual understanding of the ANS to support critical thinking and enhance nursing skills, such as interpreting physiologic signals, titrating vasoactive medications, and recognizing ANS disorders.

AB  - Core concepts in physiology, designed by physiology educators to promote improved learning and teaching, have existed for over a decade. This study aimed to investigate the extent to which a set of 15 core concepts of physiology (developed by Michael and McFarland, U.S.-based educators) are reflected in the learning outcomes (LOs) of units (subjects) comprising physiology curricula in Australian universities. From publicly accessible online information, we identified 17 Australian universities that offered a physiology major for undergraduate degree students and downloaded 788 LOs from the 166 units that comprised the majors. Each LO was blindly mapped against the 15 core concepts by 8 physiology educators from 3 Australian universities. Additionally, text-matching software was employed to match keywords and phrases (identified as descriptors of the 15 core concepts) against the LOs. The frequency of individual words and two-word phrases for each core concept was calculated and ranked. There was variability in rating LOs for the same university among academic mappers; nevertheless, many of the 15 core concepts did not appear to be adequately covered in the LOs. Two core concepts most matched manually were in the top three most mapped by the software. These were, from most common, structure/function and interdependence. Our findings suggest a lack of alignment of LOs with the core concepts across Australian physiology curricula. This highlights the need for Australiawide agreement on a set of core concepts in physiology as the first step in collaboratively improving assessment and learning and teaching practice in physiology. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This is the first time an existing set of core concepts for physiology, developed by Michael and McFarland (U.S.-based educators), have been mapped against unit (subject) learning outcomes across physiology curricula in Australian universities to gauge uptake and the need for agreement on a set of core concepts in the Australian higher education context.

AB  - Chronic pain and pain catastrophization are growing problems across the United States, within the Hispanic-American population. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) changes pain knowledge and beliefs in many populations, but its impact on reconceptualization in people of Hispanic-American origin is unknown. Explore the changes in pain knowledge in Hispanic-American individuals and the process involved in reconceptualization following a PNE lecture. Eight Hispanic-American adults participated in a mixed-methods exploratory study. The Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire (R-NPQ) was completed before, immediately after, and eight months after an adapted PNE lecture. A focus group involving four participants discussed the impact of PNE. Transcripts were translated and theme coded, and a concept map was developed by consensus. R-NPQ scores improved from 25.3% to 43.5% post-lecture, and the number of unsure responses decreased from 41.5% to 18.4%. At eight months, R-NPQ scores remained stable (44.2%) but unsure responses increased (28.9%). Themes that contributed to the process of change included cognitive dissonance, relevance of instruction, idea exchange through peer interaction, reflection, confidence, changed behaviors, and educational utility. While small improvements in knowledge and perception of pain appeared to occur with the PNE, knowledge remained low. Consideration of adult learning principles such as applicability, peer-interaction, the confrontation of beliefs, and reflection throughout PNE may enhance its impact. Future investigation should explore the efficacy of this intervention, when compared or combined with other techniques in the treatment of Hispanic-Americans experiencing persistent pain.

AB  - Currently, the world needs health-literate citizens who are able to make informed decisions about COVID-19 and other diseases. Here, we propose a COVID-19 roadmap consisting of four commented maps about infection, diagnosis, defense, treatment, and prevention. We built the maps based on those from the Atlas of Science Literacy following a qualitative methodology. Main ideas about health linked to COVID-19 and how they relate to each other can be visualized in the maps in an organized structure and according to K-levels. The maps are accompanied by a text that relates the health ideas to the COVID-19 disease. This tool can be used to promote health education and, ultimately, health literacy through the teaching and learning of COVID-19. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The urgent shift to online distance teaching and learning during the Covid-19 pandemic presented teachers with unique pedagogical, technological, and psychological challenges. The aim of this study was to map the main positive and negative experiences of teachers during this transition, as well as to examine intra- and interpersonal factors that affected teachers' ability to cope effectively with the challenges of online distance teaching. We used a mixed-method approach that combined qualitative (interviews) and quantitative (questionnaires) analyses. The interviews were analyzed using a grounded theory approach, specifically a bottom-up analysis, which led to the identification of five primary categories reflecting teachers' main concerns in online distance teaching (i.e., social, emotional, cognitive, pedagogical, and system support. The two most prominent categories were pedagogy and emotions, illustrating their centrality in teachers' experiences. A regression analysis of the questionnaires' data revealed that the two main variables which predicted both positive and negative experiences in online distance teaching were self-efficacy and teachers' attitudes towards technology integration in teaching. Findings of this study allow formulation of guidelines to promote factors related to positive experiences in online distance teaching. • Mixed-method study of teachers' experiences in online distance teaching during Covid-19. • Five categories describe main experiences: pedagogy, emotion, social, cognitive, support. • Self-efficacy predicts teachers' positive and negative experiences in distance teaching. • Attitudes towards technology predicts only positive experiences in distance teaching. • Support, openness to change and individual differences did not predict experiences.

AB  - Asking good questions is vital for scientific learning and discovery, but improving this complex skill is a formidable challenge. Here, we show in two experiments (N = 152) that teaching others—learning-by-teaching—enhances one's ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge, relative to two other well-established generative learning techniques: retrieval practice and concept-mapping. Learners who taught scientific expository texts across natural and social sciences topics by delivering video-recorded lectures outperformed their peers who practiced retrieval or constructed concept maps when tested on their ability to generate create-level research questions based on the texts (Experiment 1). This advantage held reliably even on a delayed test 48 hr later, and when all learners similarly received and responded to poststudy questions on the material (Experiment 2). Moreover, across both immediate and delayed tests, learning-by-teaching produced a recall benefit that rivaled that of the potent technique of retrieval practice. In contrast, despite recalling more than twice the study content that the concept-mapping group did, learners who practiced retrieval were unable to generate more create-level research questions based on that content. Three supplemental experiments (N = 168) further showed that retrieval practice consistently did not improve higher-order question generation over restudying, despite yielding superior long-term retention. Altogether, these findings reveal that simply possessing a wealth of factual knowledge is insufficient for generating higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Rather, teaching others is a powerful strategy for producing deep and durable learning that enables research question generation. To ask better questions, teach. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Scientific discovery often begins with the art of asking good questions. Here, we show that teaching others enhances students' ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Across immediate and delayed tests, students who taught scientific material by delivering a video-recorded lecture successfully generated more create-level research questions based on the material, as compared to their peers who used well-established learning methods such as retrieval practice and concept-mapping. While we teach, we learn to ask better research questions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Analogy-based learning methods map the concept being learned to a concept well understood by the learner. An analogy is primarily useful when learners do not know the topic being studied. Computer science is an area where the concepts exhibit a high level of abstraction and, hence, are hard for students to comprehend. The use of analogies in instruction can significantly reduce the cognitive load a student faces in learning abstract computer science concepts. The role of analogies in helping students learn computer science topics has not been explored adequately. This paper presents our efforts related to using analogy-based teaching in computer science. Over the last several years, we have developed extensive analogies for many advanced computer science concepts. We have used these analogies extensively in classroom teaching at our institution. We list the analogies that we have developed and used in our classroom teaching and, as illustration, discuss two analogies: one from the field of operating systems and another one in modular software design. We have also conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of using these two analogies on student learning outcomes. Our results confirm our hypothesis that analogy-based instruction techniques are effective and result in improved student learning outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Behavior is known as misconduct when individuals do not adhere to ethical standards, rules, or regulations. Several factors lead to misconduct, including the lack of understanding of what misconduct is among undergraduate students. However, misconduct as a concept needs more clarity and specificity.This study aimed to examine the concept of misconduct from the literature and establish an operational definition for application to nursing education.A concept analysis using Rodger’s evolutionary view was used to analyze the literature from the disciplines of: academics, business, law, and religious perspectives.An operational definition was developed based on the multidisciplinary concept analysis. A concept map was designed to help visualize the antecedents, attributes, and consequences and to assist in the conceptualization of misconduct. Implications for nursing science, administration, and education are provided.Understanding misconduct is necessary for nurse educators to ensure ethical practice within the academic context.

AB  - Students' use of learning strategies (i.e., what students do when studying) is linked to their achievement in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) courses, and several study strategies have been individually associated with course and exam grades in multiple contexts. In this study, we surveyed students in a learner-centered, large-enrollment introductory biology course about their study strategies. We aimed to identify groups of strategies that students often reported together, possibly reflecting broader approaches to studying. Exploratory factor analysis revealed three groups of study strategies frequently co-reported (which we named housekeeping strategies, use of course materials, and metacognitive strategies). These strategy groups map onto a model of learning that associates specific suites of strategies to phases of learning, which correspond to different levels of cognitive and metacognitive engagement. Consistent with previous work, only some study strategies were significantly associated with exam scores: students reporting higher use of course materials and of metacognitive strategies earned higher scores on the first course exam. Students who improved on the subsequent course exam reported increasing their use of housekeeping strategies and of course materials. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of students' approaches to studying in introductory college biology and of the relationships between study strategies and achievement. This work may support instructors in adopting intentional classroom practices to foster students' development as self-regulated learners, able to identify expectations and criteria for success and to implement appropriate and effective study strategies.

AB  - Lectures containing information presented in verbal and visual form are widely used in educational settings. To date, little is known about how the visual display in a video lecture influences immediate and delayed recall. In two experiments, participants listened to a pre-recorded lecture while viewing an animated concept map, sequential listing of bulleted text, or there was no visual display. Results indicated that the concept map lecture enhanced immediate recall accuracy; however, the type of ideas recalled is also important to consider. Compared to the listen-only lecture, the concept map and bulleted text lectures promoted more recall of main ideas rather than details. Finally, the concept map lecture mainly benefitted those with high prior science achievement. These findings suggest that the visual display in a video lecture may affect the type of ideas remembered, and prior knowledge should be considered when choosing how to present information in a video lecture.

AB  - An introductory physics course at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, which serves primarily aeronautical science and aerospace physiology majors, is re-vamped through several structural changes. Instruction for the course shifted to a modular format with a focus on conceptual learning. A series of low-stakes formative assessments were added in conjunction with high-stakes summative assessments on which students received multiple attempts to demonstrate understanding of the learning objectives. These changes were implemented during the Fall semester of 2021. The intended outcome was to increase students' motivation, engagement, and success. To measure the success of these pedagogical changes and their effectiveness in supporting student learning, final grades in the course were compared to those of previous semesters. Additionally, students' level of engagement and participation in the modular activities was compared to their scores on the Half-length Force Concept Inventory (HFC1). and exam scores were assessed across the multiple attempts to determine if the final exam scores fell closer to the first attempt or second attempt scores on the midterms. Results showed a slight increase in final exam score as compared to the first attempts of the midterm exams, although no correlation was found between student engagement level and performance on the HFCI. DFW rates were significantly lower than in previous semesters. These results are of critical interest given the plethora of new teaching practices assessed and developed during the global pandemic as well as the overall shift in students' learning modalities over the past several decades.

AB  - This study developed a causal model for the explanation of the influence of situational affective characteristics on conceptual change of students exposed to discrepant events instruction in sound waves. A population of 5474 senior secondary II school students (SSII) formed the population, while a sample of 156 students was used for the study. Six instruments were used for data collection. The reliability of the instruments was obtained using Cronbach Alpha statistics. Data collected were analyzed using path analysis for the research questions, while the hypotheses were tested using Chi-Square Goodness of Fit Index (CGFI), Adjusted Goodness of fit (AGFI), and Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA). The findings of the study showed that the causal model for explaining students' conceptual change is a model linking cognitive conflict, situational interest, self-efficacy, attention, and effort among others. It was recommended among others that teachers should ensure that students' attentions are activated during teaching which determines students' effort to learn meaningfully during teaching of physics concepts.

AB  - The way in which one understands information and concepts, and the way a student works to develop this, is an individual aspect of learning that cannot be universally defined as (at least manifested) the same for everyone. 'Understanding' is a broad term, and the way one achieves understanding is dependent on the way that material is presented. In this article, we argue that the philosophy of science can be important to nursing education—in particular, by showing that the way we imbue understanding might depend on the meaning of 'understanding'. Diagrams and concept maps are meant to guide newly formed knowledge and connections to develop proper thinking (e.g., the order in which nursing students must prioritize data) that a student requires in the field. We argue that whether or not an image/diagram/concept map confers understanding will depend on both what the object is and what we mean by 'understanding'. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Quantum state tomography (QST) is a fundamental tool requiring privacy in future distributed systems where unknown states are measured for extracting information. Gentle measurement and differential privacy (DP)-based privacy solutions minimize the damage on unknown state and leakage about the quantum information, respectively. In this article, we propose a fundamentally different design for privacy-preserving QST in a multi-party setting. We assume that Alice delegates QST task of a distant source for which she has no access to a third-party player Bob accessing to the source while preserving the source privacy against the operations realized by Bob. Encrypted QST algorithm is proposed which encodes or maps source computational basis states by exploiting phase estimation and feature mapping concept of quantum machine learning (QML). Bob maps basis states to eigenvalues of a specially designed unitary operator in an entangled manner with his ancillary qubits while teleporting the source qubits back to Alice before applying conventional QST. Encoding mechanism is conjectured as having NP-hard decoding complexity based on difficulty of subset-sum problem combined with Hadamard transform. Linear optical design and quantum circuit implementations are presented for future experiments in noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. Theoretical and numerical supporting evidences are proposed supporting the proposed eigenstructure. EQST promises further applications for multiple source classification tasks and as a novel feature mapping method for future data embedding tasks in QML. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: To combat/control the COVID-19 pandemic, a complete lockdown was implemented in China for almost 6 months during 2020. Purpose: To determine the impact of a long-term lockdown on the academic performance of first-year nursing students via mandatory online learning, and to determine the benefits of online teaching. Methods: The recruitment and academic performance of 1st-year nursing students were assessed between 2019 [prior to COVID-19, n = 195, (146 women)] and 2020 [during COVID-19, n = 180 (142 women)]. The independent sample t test or Mann-Whitney test was applied for a comparison between these two groups. Results: There was no significant difference in student recruitment between 2019 and 2020. The overall performance of the first-year students improved in the Biochemistry, Immunopathology, Traditional Chinese Medicine Nursing and Combined Nursing courses via mandatory online teaching in 2020 compared with traditional teaching in 2019. Conclusion: Suspension of in-class learning but continuing education virtually online has occurred without negatively impacting academic performance, thus academic goals are more than achievable in a complete lockdown situation. This study offers firm evidence to forge a path for developments in teaching methods to better incorporate virtual learning and technology in order to adapt to fast-changing environments. However, the psychological/psychiatric and physical impact of the COVID-19 lockdown and the lack of face-to-face interaction on these students remains to be explored. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Situating learners in a context relevant to scientific phenomena enables them to acquire knowledge through experience, reflection, conceptualization, and practice, which is an important learning mode in science education. However, learners generally do not have opportunities to experience many scientific phenomena in the real world. Therefore, virtual learning environments (VLE) are becoming a frequently adopted technology to provide authentic learning contexts. In particular, spherical video-based learning environments (SVLE), which are a low-tech form of VLE, have attracted the attention of school teachers and educational technology researchers. Additionally, effective assessment methods, such as the two-tier-test, have been adopted to examine learners' performance during the virtual learning process. On the other hand, researchers have pointed out that lack of effective learning strategies may decrease the learning effects in a virtual learning context. Hence, this study integrated a graphic organizer into a two-tier test-based learning mode, in which the first-tier questions were declarative items with a short answer (e.g., the questions of where, what, and when), whereas the second-tier questions were more in-depth, deeper causal-type questions (e.g., the questions of why and how), in the contexts of SVLE. To verify the effectiveness of this learning approach, a graphic organizer-based two-tier test SVLE was developed; moreover, a quasi-experimental design was conducted in the "Mysteries of the Earth" unit of the sixth graders' natural science course. A total of 41 sixth graders from two classes, with an average age of 12, were recruited in this experiment. One class was assigned to be the experimental group adopting the graphic organizer-based two-tier test SVLE (GT-SVLE), while the other was the control group adopting the conventional two-tier test-based SVLE (CT-SVLE). All of the students learned with the SVLE using tablet computers. Based on the results, the GT-SVLE could better improve students' learning achievement than the CT-SVLE. Besides, according to behavioral analysis and interviews, the control group had significantly more learning behaviors of repeated reading of supplementary materials and repeated wrong answers, indicating that the proposed approach facilitated students' positive behaviors through observation and knowledge construction in SVLE, which helped them achieve the learning objectives. • A spherical video-based learning environments (SVLE) learning approach is proposed. • The approach advanced students' positive behaviors through observation and knowledge. • The approach was conducted with two-tier test strategy. • The study was conducted in the unit of the sixth graders' natural science course. • The study used concept map as a tool for researching.

AB  - The objective of this paper is to report observations from a 10-week summer training program on Data Management in Animal and Plant Sciences. A total of six undergraduate students from three universities in the Texas A&M University System [Texas A&M University (TAMU)-College Station, TAMUKingsville, and TAMU-Corpus Christi] representing disciplines of Animal Science, Plant Science, and Computer Science learned handling and interpretation of sensor-based data derived from both animal sensors and UAV images of plant fields. Students attended weekly training sessions on data collection, management, processing, and visualization software including ArcGIS, MySQL and power BI. In addition, students also worked as a team and developed a database project and gave an oral presentation on their team project. On the pretraining survey, two students indicated that they had a background in animal science, two students indicated a background in plant science, one student in computer science, and one student with experience in spatial data. To begin with, the students had a mean score of 4.3 (range 0-8; on a scale of 0-10) for knowledge of data management in agriculture. One third of the students indicated that they did not have data handling experience, and one half of the students had some data analysis experience whereas one student indicated partial experience of working with data. In general, students indicated that they were very satisfied with the internship experience. On a scale of 0-10, the mean satisfaction score was 8.75 (range 7.5-10). Students indicated that they were more confident to work with and talk about data from animal systems (mean 8.5; range 7-10) and plant systems (mean = 8.4; range = 7-10). All students agreed that they learned at least one new concept related to animal and plant data ecosystems. Students indicated that the program was a good start for understanding the overall data architecture, indicated progress on data handling and thought helpful to understand opportunities in agriculture. All students agreed that their understanding of data management in agriculture changed significantly because of the course. Consequently, four students indicated that they were interested in career opportunities related to data in agriculture whereas two students indicated their interest in application of the developed tools for the on-farm use. When evaluating effect of the cross disciplinary training, students agreed that the training was helpful in learning concepts outside of their own discipline with the mean score 9.4(range 8-10) on a scale of 0-10. All students indicated that they learned team management skills and skills working with people that are different from their own. Students suggested improvement on the communications, prerecorded videos, in-person meetings, weekly reporting reviews in the future iterations for students to benefit more from the program.

AB  - Background and Purpose: In recent decades, a focus on the most critical and fundamental concepts has proven highly advantageous to students and educators in many science disciplines. Pharmacology, unlike microbiology, biochemistry, or physiology, lacks a consensus list of such core concepts. Experimental Approach: We sought to develop a research‐based, globally relevant list of core concepts that all students completing a foundational pharmacology course should master. This two‐part project consisted of exploratory and refinement phases. The exploratory phase involved empirical data mining of the introductory sections of five key textbooks, in parallel with an online survey of over 200 pharmacology educators from 17 countries across six continents. The refinement phase involved three Delphi rounds involving 24 experts from 15 countries across six continents. Key Results: The exploratory phase resulted in a consolidated list of 74 candidate core concepts. In the refinement phase, the expert group produced a consensus list of 25 core concepts of pharmacology. Conclusion and Implications: This list will allow pharmacology educators everywhere to focus their efforts on the conceptual knowledge perceived to matter most by experts within the discipline. Next steps for this project include defining and unpacking each core concept and developing resources to help pharmacology educators globally teach and assess these concepts within their educational contexts.

AB  - Background: The aim of this work was to explicate a conceptual framework of psychosocial elements assessed in candidates for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and to explore differences in the conceptualization based on the use of risk rating scales in clinical practice. Methods: Concept mapping is a mixed methods participatory approach to elicit and organize the ideas of a group of stakeholders and produce a composite conceptual framework. Participants were social workers and psychologists with experience assessing HCT candidates. Results: Participants brainstormed 114 psychosocial elements and conceptualized them into 12 distinct clusters: Transplant Mindset, Support System, Caregiver, Lodging and Transportation, Financial and Legal, Work, Demographic Characteristics, Mental Health, Communication, Educational and Resource Needs, Physical Functioning, and Cognition. Participants who used risk rating scales did not prioritize the importance of the clusters differently than those who did not. Conclusions: The conceptualization converges and diverges with the literature. Divergences are of particular interest since the perspectives of practicing psychosocial professionals have been largely absent from the literature. The conceptual framework can guide psychosocial providers in assessing patients. Assessing the caregiver is a high priority, as is evaluating the patient's mental health and mindset about transplant.

AB  - Despite the importance of developing elementary science teachers' content knowledge for teaching (CKT), there are limited assessments that have been designed to measure the full breadth of their CKT at scale. Our overall research project addressed this gap by developing an online assessment to measure elementary preservice teachers' CKT about matter and its interactions. This study, which was part of our larger project, reports on findings from one component of the item development process examining the construct validity of 118 different CKT about matter assessment items. In this study, 86 elementary teachers participated in cognitive interviews to examine: (a) the knowledge and reasoning they used when responding to these CKT about matter assessment items and (b) the nature of the content challenges and the content teaching challenges they encountered. Findings showed that over 80% of participant interview responses indicated that the CKT about matter items functioned as hypothesized, providing evidence to support future use of these items on a large‐scale assessment and in studies of science teachers' CKT. When responding to the items, participants showed evidence of four main challenges with the science content: (a) using scientific concepts to reason about science tasks, (b) using adequate evidence to reason about science phenomenon, (c) drawing upon examples of scientific phenomena, and (d) drawing upon science vocabulary. Findings also showed that participants experienced challenges regarding the following content teaching aspects when responding to these items: (a) connecting to key scientific concepts involved in the work of teaching science, (b) attending to instructional goal(s), and (c) recognizing features of grade‐level appropriateness. Implications for using CKT items as part of large‐scale science assessment systems and identifying areas to target in elementary science teachers' CKT development are addressed.

AB  - Students' misconceptions of various topics in physics have been investigated by many researchers. The detection of misconceptions is very difficult and takes a long time as a human being. Our aim in the study carried out is to determine the misconceptions of the students regarding the concept of the atom by machine instead of humans. This study proposes two novel methods: the Transformers model and the fastText algorithm, to classify the students' answers. Since there is currently no Turkish language model for physics-related questions or the physics domain, we trained a transformer model from scratch for this domain using transfer learning and domain adaptation techniques. In the second part of this research, we proposed an unsupervised learning approach to accurately understand and identify the reasons behind the misconceptions. For this purpose, we utilized sentence transformers to obtain vector representation of the sentences with transformer-based denoising autoencoder training. We then used two clustering algorithms: an agglomerative one and a density-based one, to group similar sentences in a high-dimensional vector space. Again, for the first time, the unsupervised transformer-based denoising autoencoder training of the sentence transformers was employed for the Turkish language to provide domain adaptation for sentence transformers. Finally, we compared the human performance (experts' opinions) and the proposed method results for both the classification and the clustering tasks according to the kappa metric. According to our results, we managed to distinguish misconceptions with a high accuracy of between 0.97 and 1.00 with our proposed methodology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) has become an essential skill nowadays. For young students, CT competency is required to prepare them for future jobs. This competency can facilitate students' understanding of programming knowledge which has been a challenge for many novices pursuing a computer science degree. This study focuses on designing and implementing a virtual reality (VR) game-based application (iThinkSmart) to support CT knowledge. The study followed the design science research methodology to design, implement, and evaluate the first prototype of the VR application. An initial evaluation of the prototype was conducted with 47 computer science students from a Nigerian university who voluntarily participated in an experimental process. To determine what works and what needs to be improved in the iThinkSmart VR game-based application, two groups were randomly formed, consisting of the experimental (n = 21) and the control (n = 26) groups respectively. Our findings suggest that VR increases motivation and therefore increase students' CT skills, which contribute to knowledge regarding the affordances of VR in education and particularly provide evidence on the use of visualization of CT concepts to facilitate programming education. Furthermore, the study revealed that immersion, interaction, and engagement in a VR educational application can promote students' CT competency in higher education institutions (HEI). In addition, it was shown that students who played the iThinkSmart VR game-based application gained higher cognitive benefits, increased interest and attitude to learning CT concepts. Although further investigation is required in order to gain more insights into students learning process, this study made significant contributions in positioning CT in the HEI context and provides empirical evidence regarding the use of educational VR mini games to support students learning achievements.

AB  - In order to sustain solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) net output power and prevent violation of oxygen excess ratio (OER) constraint and fuel utilization (FU) constraint, a data-driven gas supply system coordination management method is proposed. Accordingly, a population evolution-based multi-agent double delay deep deterministic policy gradient (PE-MA4DPG) algorithm is introduced. The artificial intelligence design of the algorithm is guided by the concepts of imitation learning and curriculum learning, whereby different agents of different combinations are trained in different environments, thus improving the robustness of the coordination strategy. In this algorithm, the hydrogen controller and the air controller are treated as two agents. The centralized training enables agents with different objectives to coordinate with each other. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated in three experiments, wherein the proposed algorithm is compared with a group of existing algorithms. • A 5kW SOFC gas supply system model considering various operating parameters is proposed. • A data-driven gas supply system coordination management method is proposed. • A novel large-scale deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed for this method. • The PE-MA4DPG algorithm proposed is characterized by superior robustness. • The proposed algorithm can guarantee better SOFC stability, performance, and efficiency, whilst satisfying the SOFC constraints.

AB  - In this article, the authors explore and contribute to producing a performative research paradigm where post-qualitative as well as artistic research might dwell and breathe. Entering a thread of discussion that started with Haseman's A manifesto for performative research in 2006, and building on their own friction-led research processes at the edges of qualitative research, the authors plug in with performativity, non-representational theories and methodologies, post-qualitative inquiry and post approaches. A performative paradigm for post-qualitative inquiry is proposed, where knowledge is viewed as knowledge-in-becoming as the constant creation of difference through researcher entanglement with the research phenomenon and wider world. A performative paradigm produces a space for movement, (artistic) freedom, (post-qualitative) experimentation and inclusion. A performative research paradigm also offers provocations that shake long-established notions about what research is and should be. Within a performative research paradigm, learning/be(com)ing/knowing is always in-becoming – as is the performative paradigm itself. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Afforestation is one of the most effective processes for removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and combating global warming. Landsat data and machine learning approaches can be used to map afforestation (i) indirectly, by constructing two maps of the same area over different periods and then predicting changes, or (ii) directly, by constructing a single map and analyzing observations of change in both the response and remotely sensed variables. Of crucial importance, no comprehensive comparisons of direct and indirect approaches for afforestation monitoring are known to have been conducted to date. Afforestation maps estimated through the analysis of remotely sensed data may serve as intermediate products for guiding the selection of samples and the production of statistics. In this and similar studies, a huge effort is dedicated to collecting validation data. In turn, those validation datasets have varying sampling intensities in different areas, which complicates their use for assessing the accuracies of new maps. As a result, the work done to collect data is often not sufficiently exploited, with some validation datasets being used just once. In this study, we addressed two main aims. First, we implemented a methodology to reuse validation data acquired via stratified sampling with strata constructed from remote sensing maps. Second, we used this method for acquiring data for comparing map accuracy estimates and the precision of estimates for direct and indirect approaches for country-wide mapping of afforestation that occurred in Italy between 1985 and 2019. To facilitate these comparisons, we used Landsat imagery, random forest classification, and Google Earth Engine. The herein-presented method produced different accuracy estimates with 95% confidence interval and for different map classes. Afforestation accuracies ranged between 53 ± 5.9% for the indirect map class inside the buffer—defined as a stratum within 120 m of the forest/non-forest mask boundaries—and 26 ± 3.4% for the direct map outside the buffer. The accuracy in non-afforestation map classes was much greater, ranging from 87 ± 1.9% for the indirect map inside the buffer to 99 ± 1.3% for the direct map outside the buffer. Additionally, overall accuracies (with 95% CI) were estimated with large precision for both direct and indirect maps (87 ± 1.3% and 89 ± 1.6%, respectively), confirming (i) the effectiveness of the method we introduced for reusing samples and (ii) the relevance of remotely sensed data and machine learning for monitoring afforestation.

AB  - The paper examines doctoral research in the library & information science discipline at Panjab University, Chandigarh, based on student's perceptions and expectations by posing several research questions. This study aimed to gain insight into research scholar's perspectives on earning a Ph.D. Based on primary data from 48 respondents through a structured questionnaire in April 2018, the study tabulated, analysed and interpreted information to draw inferences. As the study is limited to research scholars at the DLIS at Panjab University, the universe of the study is relatively narrow. The study's findings reveal that most respondents had a personal decision to get admitted to the Ph.D. programme. However, there were cases where better job prospects, promotion in career, some practical problems, and the advice of a friend/senior/teacher motivated them to join doctoral research. The Panjab University was the first and last choice for the majority of respondents for doing a Ph.D. Two-thirds of respondents stated that quality of doctoral research accomplished in the DLIS PU is good and applied, and three-fifths believed that the research quality has improved with time. Only one-fifth of respondents found quality of physical Infrastructure for doctoral research work in the Department is of the best quality. Several respondents feel that doctoral research at Panjab University and India, in general, still depends on research models applied in Western countries, especially in the UK and USA. However, a group of respondents believed it is either struggling to have its own identity or is a blend of Western and Oriental modes. Researchers will be encouraged to choose regionally relevant and application-oriented topics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the information age, the acquisition of data literacy skills has become increasingly important for undergraduate student success, yet these skills are not emphasized in the lecture setting. Here we present a study to inspire educators to scaffold graph knowledge and interpretation into their classrooms. Specifically, we sought to understand how frequent use of published graphing materials (Angra & Gardner 2016, 2018) and freely available primary literature and data repositories, complemented by active-learning instructional approaches, in an upper-level animal behavior lecture course affect student graph knowledge and interpretation skills. The effectiveness of graphing materials and students’ graphing abilities were evaluated by three exams over the course of the semester. Findings revealed overall improvement with graph choice and interpretation abilities, particularly in interpreting the purpose of the graph, the nature of the data, and the relationships between independent and dependent variables and take-home messages. These findings support and extend the utility of the graphing materials to undergraduate lecture courses and illustrate the progression of student learning with graph choice and interpretation.

AB  - Video-based review of surgical procedures has proven to be useful in training by enabling efficiency in the qualitative assessment of surgical skill and intraoperative decision-making. Current video segmentation protocols focus largely on procedural steps. Although some operations are more complex than others, many of the steps in any given procedure involve an intricate choreography of basic maneuvers such as suturing, knot tying, and cutting. The use of these maneuvers at certain procedural steps can convey information that aids in the assessment of the complexity of the procedure, surgical preference, and skill. Our study aims to develop and evaluate an algorithm to identify these maneuvers. A standard deep learning architecture was used to differentiate between suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting on a data set comprised of videos from practicing clinicians (N = 52) who participated in a simulated enterotomy repair. Perception of the added value to traditional artificial intelligence segmentation was explored by qualitatively examining the utility of identifying maneuvers in a subset of steps for an open colon resection. An accuracy of 84% was reached in differentiating maneuvers. The precision in detecting the basic maneuvers was 87.9%, 60%, and 90.9% for suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting, respectively. The qualitative concept mapping confirmed realistic scenarios that could benefit from basic maneuver identification. Basic maneuvers can indicate error management activity or safety measures and allow for the assessment of skill. Our deep learning algorithm identified basic maneuvers with reasonable accuracy. Such models can aid in artificial intelligence-assisted video review by providing additional information that can complement traditional video segmentation protocols. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science education reform efforts have emphasized the incorporation of more authentic and meaningful scientific practices into formal learning environments. With this focus on practices, such as scientific modeling, a powerful tool for sense‐making and reasoning, comes a need to observe and understand if and how it is actually occurring, particularly in elementary science learning environments. To address this need, and moving forward an international, collaborative research effort centered around scientific modeling, we undertook a cross‐national observational study in which we used an observation protocol to characterize scientific modeling practices in elementary classrooms in both the United States and Germany. Drawing on existing video‐based datasets from multiple projects, this study's findings provide empirical evidence for model‐based teaching and learning and explore the relative frequencies of relevant modeling subpractices (i.e., construction, use, evaluation, and revision of scientific models) in regular, day‐to‐day elementary science classrooms. This study also illustrates the differences and similarities between German and American science instruction. In general, students in both countries experience model construction more often than other modeling practices. German teachers more consistently foreground anchoring phenomena and students' questions/preconceptions as part of the modeling process, thus leading to slightly higher overall modeling scores—despite a complete lack of model evaluation and revision in any of the observed German classrooms. Ultimately, however, young learners in both nations seem to experience alarmingly little opportunities to engage in any of the modeling subpractices. Particularly in terms of modeling as a means to make sense of phenomena, constrained by teachers most commonly using finished representations (i.e., models) of phenomena and processes to teach science/deliver content. Our results indicate the need for a greater focus on all scientific modeling subprocesses, particularly the integration of scientific modeling with already established, more general (e.g., inquiry‐based) strategies for effective science teaching and an emphasis on actualizing modeling as an authentic sense‐making endeavor.

AB  - The demand for improving student interest in science has increased efforts toward teaching Einstein’s theory of general relativity in schools. Research has already shown that teaching Einsteinian gravity at the secondary level is feasible, however, appropriate resources must be readily available for science teachers to make Einsteinian gravity part of the school curriculum. This paper addresses student learning through activities that include simple hand-held experiments that help secondary school teachers and their Year 7 students grasp two key concepts that led Einstein to develop his theory of gravity — the speed of gravity and his ‘happiest thought’ about free-fall and weightlessness. The first experiment allows students to conceptualise the speed of gravity. Three further experiments help them explore free-fall and weightlessness in different situations. We analyse the evolving conceptions of Year 7 students (N = 44) on understanding free-fall in an 8-lesson program that includes these experiments in the third lesson. Improvements in students’ understanding over 8 lessons, showed that time and reinforcement were needed to assimilate the concepts. After eight lessons, 86% of students gave an Einsteinian explanation of free-fall. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Latin America and the Caribbean Region are home to about 42 million Indigenous people, with about 900,000 living in Brazil. The little routinely collected population-level data from Indigenous communities in the region available shows stark inequities in health and well-being. There are 305 Indigenous ethnic groups, speaking 274 languages, spread across the remote national territory, who have endured long-lasting inequities related to poverty, poor health, and limited access to health care. Malnutrition and mental health are key concerns for young people. Building on our Indigenous communities-academic partnerships over the last two decades, we collaborated with young people from the Terena Indigenous ethnic group, village leaders, teachers, parents, and local health practitioners from the Polo Base (community health centres) to obtain their perspectives on important and feasible actions for a youth health promotion programme. Methods: The report was conducted in the Tereré Village in Mato Grosso do Sul. Concept mapping, a participatory mixed method approach, was conducted in 7 workshops, 15 adults and 40 youths aged 9–17 years. Art-based concept mapping was used with 9 to 11 years old children (N = 20). Concept systems software was used to create concept maps, which were finalised during the workshops. Focused prompts related to factors that may influence the health and happiness of youths. The participatory method gave Terena youths a significant voice in shaping an agenda that can improve their health. Results: Terena youths identified priority actions that clustered under 'Family', 'School', 'Education', 'Socio-economic circumstances', 'Respect' and 'Sport' in response to protecting happiness; and 'Nutrition pattern', 'Physical activity', 'Local environment', and 'Well-being' in response to having a healthy body. Through the participatory lens of concept mapping, youths articulated the interconnectedness of priority actions across these clusters such that behaviours (e.g. Nutrition pattern, drinking water, physical activity) and aspirations (being able to read, to have a good job) were recognised to be dependent on a wider ecology of factors (e.g. loss of eco-systems, parent-child relationships, student- teacher relationships, parental unemployment). In response to developing youth health, Terena adults suggested priority actions that clustered under 'Relationships', 'Health issues', 'Prevention at Polo Base', 'Access to health care', 'Communication with young people', 'Community life', 'Raising awareness' and 'School support'. Their priorities reflected the need for structural transformative actions (e.g. Polo Base and school staff working together) and for embedding actions to protect Indigenous culture (e.g. integrating their cultural knowledge into training programmes). Conclusions: Concept maps of Indigenous youths emphasised the need for a health promotion programme that engages with the structural and social determinants of health to protect their happiness and health, whilst those of adults emphasised the need to address specific health issues through preventative care via a school-Polo Base collaboration. Investment in a co-developed school-Polo-Base health promotion programme, with intersectoral engagement, has potential for making Indigenous health systems responsive to the inequalities of youth health, to yield dividends for healthy ageing trajectories as well as for the health of the next generation.

AB  - The theory of evolution can be a useful basis for developing students' understanding of ecology. Our study used concept maps to examine the development of sixth-grade students' understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem following several evolution 'Science Days' conducted at 'Nature Campus' – an informal learning environment comprised of a natural history museum, zoological and botanical gardens. The programme included physical experiences, such as observations and measurements of fossils, skeletons and mounted specimens, and observations in the zoological and botanical gardens. After the first and fourth days, the students watched the film 'March of the Penguins,' and were asked to draw concept maps depicting the penguins' lives. These maps were then analysed to assess: (a) the changes in the students' depictions of the ecosystem's complexity, and (b) the manner and extent to which they used ideas and concepts in evolution to explain phenomena in the Antarctic ecosystem. We found that the students' concept maps increased in complexity, and their post-maps incorporated concepts in evolution from their experiences at Nature Campus. Our results therefore emphasise the benefits of fundamentally changing how biology education is divided and defined, and transitioning to a more holistic approach that acknowledges the interdisciplinary nature of biological phenomena.

AB  - This study examined a network of concepts used in the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment in relation to somatic cell division and investigated the alignment of science concepts used in them. Textbooks and teachers' instruction and evaluation questions were collected to analyse the alignment between the concepts and the conceptual network used in the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment on the basis of the national science curriculum in the Republic of Korea. The findings of this study suggest that the concept of a cell was used as a linkage, and a lack of conceptual linkage prevailed between the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment in the somatic cell division unit. In comparison with the curriculum, a rapid increase in the number of concepts presented in classes led to a complicated conceptual network. As the conceptual network was complex and ambiguous, the concepts that students can learn are more likely to be ambiguous. Therefore, the conceptual network could be instrumental for facilitating students' conceptual understanding of somatic cell division. The alignment of concepts and conceptual linkage in the teaching of somatic cell division could contribute to improving conceptual associations between the curriculum, textbooks, instruction, and assessment.

AB  - Some science subjects are often perceived to be difficult and boring by students due to their nature and the way they are taught. This study sought to check the effectiveness of the technology-enhanced instruction method with comprehensive use of virtual labs and animations in teaching nerve cells' (neurons and glial cells) structures and functions. Mayer's cognitive theory of multimedia learning provided the theoretical model to frame the study. This study used a quasi-experimental design of pre-test and post-test where four secondary schools all from the southern province of Rwanda were selected from two different districts. Two schools from Ruhango District were assigned to the experimental group while the other two schools from Muhanga District were assigned to the control group. The study involved 168 students, 83 forming the control group, and 85 forming the experimental group. The biology test based on nerve cells was used to assess the effect of teaching strategies before and after learning. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS version 23, and we computed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and repeated measures ANOVA. The results indicated that the students who learned nerve cells by use of technology-enhanced instruction of virtual labs and animations outperformed those who learned with conventional methods (M. exp. = 80.41% with SD = 10.32 versus M. cont. = 47.11% with SD = 10.68 and a p-value < 0.05). The results also indicated that after learning with virtual labs and animations, the number of students who were able to perform each of the 20 questions of the test increased considerably. The study recommends the use of virtual labs and animations to enhance students' understanding of nerve cells. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study investigated the impact of PhET simulation-based learning on students' motivation and academic achievement in learning oscillations and waves among Malawian secondary students. The following research questions guided the study: (i) What were students' motivation and academic achievement levels at the beginning of the study in oscillation and waves? (ii) To what levels do PhET interactive simulation-based learning impact students' motivation and achievement in oscillations and waves? (iii) Is the change in post-test scores due to the students' characteristics in non-randomized settings or the PhET interactive simulation-based learning? A sample of 280 (44.6% females) form three secondary school students with a mean age of 17.5 (SD = 1.424) from four schools in Blantyre urban district in Malawi was used in a quasi-experimental design of non-equivalent groups. The experimental group was exposed to PhET simulation-based learning, while the conventional teaching methods were used in the control group. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data on academic achievement, and questionnaires collected data on motivation. Independent samples t-test showed a statistical difference between the two groups on post-test of the academic achievement. Results from linear regression indicated that the differences between the two groups in the post-test were not due to students' characteristics but rather the intervention with p < 0.01. The ANCOVA test on motivation constructs showed a significant difference with a small effect size between the study groups on self-efficacy, active learning strategies, performance goals, achievement goals, learning environment stimulation, and attitudes towards learning with computer learning. The results from the study suggest that PhET simulation-based learning improved the learning of oscillations and waves. PhET simulation-based learning provides visualizations and teaching aids that help easily understand content knowledge, hence improving students' academic achievement and motivation levels.

AB  - Forest growing stem volume (GSV) is regarded as one of the most important parameters for the quality evaluation and dynamic monitoring of forest resources. The accuracy of mapping forest GSV is highly related to the employed models and involved remote sensing features, and the criteria of feature evaluation severely affect the performance of the employed models. However, due to the linear or nonlinear relationships between remote sensing features and GSV, widely used evaluation criteria inadequately express the complex sensitivity between forest GSV and spectral features, especially the saturation levels of features in a planted forest. In this study, novel feature evaluation criteria were constructed based on the Pearson correlations and optical saturation levels of the alternative remote sensing features extracted from two common optical remote sensing image sets (GF-1 and Sentinel-2). Initially, the spectral saturation level of each feature was quantified using the kriging spherical model and the quadratic model. Then, optimal feature sets were obtained with the proposed criteria and the linear stepwise regression model. Finally, four widely used machine learning models—support vector machine (SVM), multiple linear stepwise regression (MLR), random forest (RF) and K-neighborhood (KNN)—were employed to map forest GSV in a planted Chinese fir forest. The results showed that the proposed feature evaluation criteria could effectively improve the accuracy of estimating forest GSV and that the systematic distribution of errors between the predicted and ground measurements in the range of forest GSV was less than 300 m3/hm2. After using the proposed feature evaluation criteria, the highest accuracy of mapping GSV was obtained with the RF model for GF-1 images (R2 = 0.49, rRMSE = 28.67%) and the SVM model for Sentinel-2 images (R2 = 0.52, rRMSE = 26.65%), and the decreased rRMSE values ranged from 1.1 to 6.2 for GF-1 images (28.67% to 33.08%) and from 2.3 to 6.8 for Sentinel-2 images (26.85% to 33.28%). It was concluded that the sensitivity of the optimal feature set and the accuracy of the estimated GSV could be improved using the proposed evaluation criteria (less than 300 m3/hm2). However, these criteria were barely able to improve mapping accuracy for a forest with a high GSV (larger than 300 m3/hm2). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: Access to learning resources in higher education is a prerequisite for effective learning. The purpose of this study is to investigate how marketing of library resources can influences library usage of students from the University of Education Winneba and University of Cape Coast in Ghana. Design/methodology/approach: The study was grounded in the pragmatic paradigm and guided by the mixed methods research approach. The sequential explanatory design was used in that, quantitative data was collected first, followed by the collection of qualitative data. The respondents were selected using the multi-stage and purposive sampling techniques. A total of 1,170 students were involved in the quantitative study, and the qualitative study comprised 12 students and 6 librarians. The quantitative data were analysed descriptively using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS), while the qualitative data were analysed thematically. Findings: The study found that the marketing of library resources and services increased awareness and motivates students from the University of Education Winneba and University of Cape Coast to use them. In addition, the study found no relationship between competencies in information literacy and the use of library resources and services beyond developing students' capacity to use library resources The study further established a positive relationship between improved learning activities and the use of library resources and services by students at the University of Education Winneba and University of Cape Coast in Ghana. Originality/value: The study is unique in its scope and focus and will lead understanding to the use of library services and resources to achieving positive learning outcomes in Ghanaian distance learning institutions. Thus, the expanded benefit to students' use of library services not only will improve their academic activities, performances, retention, programme completion, employment opportunities and lifelong learning but also is important for institutions to increase students' enrolments, increase university world-wide visibility and influence national development.

AB  - This article describes how preservice elementary teachers learn about the nature of science and develop scientific literacy through a collaborative project that prepares them to design meaningful learning experiences for students. The Life’s Replica Project was an effort between a college professor and an elementary school teacher to facilitate meaningful science learning. The preservice teachers were students from two college courses in a teacher preparation program. The project’s strategy focused on learning through problematization and inquiry-based activities that engaged participants in diverse and collaborative learner-centered experiences. Students were presented with the problem of human beings’ impact on Earth’s ecosystems, and they were challenged to collaborate through community service by creating and presenting a product that addressed the needs they identified. Some of the project’s assessments were the answers gathered in the KWH table (know, want to know, and how will we learn it), from group reflections on the learning experiences with the core activities of the project, and through the creation of educational materials. The project’s assessment outcomes demonstrated its contribution to the development of meaningful science learning for preservice elementary teachers [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study aimed to examine the effect of pictorial based learning (PcBL) on conceptual change in the topic of chemical kinetics. The four-tier instrument (FTDICK) previously developed was deployed to map conceptual change within chemical kinetics concepts. First-year chemistry students at an Indonesian university formed an experimental and a control group. The experimental group experienced the PcBL approach while the control one experienced direct instruction (DI). The conceptual changes demonstrated by the two groups are classified into four categories, namely complete, partial, false and random. Complete conceptual change (CCC) had the highest occurrence rate among the four categories. However, generalising that PcBL and DI are influential in promoting conceptual change in the field of chemical kinetics may be too ambitious. Therefore, further research is needed to reach that conclusion. The effectiveness of PcBL and DI in promoting conceptual change in this study was almost equal. However, in answering the FTDICK questions, the PcBL students showed a better performance reflecting more sound scientific understanding than DI students did. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Ова студија је имала за циљ да испита утицај учења заснованог на илустрацијама (PcBL) на концептуалне промене у оквиру теме Хемијска кинетика. За мапирање кон- цептуалних промена у оквиру концепата хемијске кинетике, коришћен је претходно развијени четворослојни инструмент (FTDICK). Студенти прве године хемије на једном универзитету у Индонезији формирали су експерименталну и контролну групу. Експе- риментална група је обучавана применом PcBL методе, док је контролна група обуча- вана применом директне инструкције (DI). Концептуалне промене које су уочене у оквиру ове две групе класификоване су у четири категорије: потпуне, парцијалне, лажне и насумичне. Потпуна концептуална промена (CCC) је имала највећи степен учеста- лости од четири наведене категорије. Међутим, било би исувише амбициозно генера- лизовати да су и PcBL и DI ефикасни у поспешивању концептуалних промена у области хемијске кинетике. Да би се извео такав закључак, потребна су додатна истраживања. Ефикасност PcBL и DI методе у поспешивању концептуалних промена у овој студији била је готово једнака. Међутим, у решавању задатака на FTDICK, студенти PcBL групе су остварили бољи учинак од студената DI групе и тиме показали боље научно разу- мевање. (Serbian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - It is often challenging for physics instructors to dedicate time during a course to engage students in developing strategic approaches to learning in addition to problem-solving skills and content knowledge. In this work, we introduce a simple modification to our teaching practice with the purpose of fostering student development of self-regulated learning (SRL). Instructional practices supportive of self-regulated learning are associated with positive academic, social, and personal outcomes in higher education. Research also indicates that students can improve in their self-regulation over time, and we demonstrate that instructors can support this development in class with strategies that require minimal class time. In the context of classroom instruction, we can think of SRL as an intentional, active, and goal-driven engagement in learning activities that relies on metacognitive knowledge and skills.

AB  - Concept mapping remains widely used in education. However, little is known about how self‐constructed concept maps and peer feedback can improve student learning outcomes in chemistry. We investigated the effects of peer feedback on concept mapping and how it improves students' learning performance in a large second‐semester, introductory chemistry course. Three hundred and twenty students were randomly assigned to one of two concept mapping conditions: self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback and self‐constructed concept map without peer feedback. Each group constructed concept maps that depicted the relationship between concepts on the topic of intermolecular force. The results showed that students in the self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback condition outperformed students in the no peer feedback condition in chemistry learning outcome. Overall, this study demonstrates that peer feedback enhances the effectiveness of learning with generative concept maps. The implications and future directions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The change detection and land use and land cover (LULC) maps are more important powerful forces behind numerous ecological systems and fallow land. The current research focuses on demarcating the spatiotemporal LULC changes, NDVI and change detections maps. These effects directly affect the ecosystem, land resources, cropping pattern and agriculture. LULC assessment and surveillance are essential for long-term planning and sustainable use of natural resources. However, we have developed the soft computing machine learning algorithm for mapping land use and land cover based on the Google earth engine (GEE) platform and change detection mapping done by SAGA GIS software. It is significantly used for ecological safety and planning under various climate variations. To accurately describe the land use and land cover classes with changes are identified in the area. This area exclusively uses the multitemporal Landsat-5 (30 m) and Sentinel2 (10 m) imageries in LULC mapping. The GEE is a cloud-computing platform with the prevailing classification ability of random forest (RF) models to make five-year interval LULC maps for 2010, 2015 and 2020. To unique multiple RF models established as a classifier in the algorithm created by JavaScript and GEE. SAGA GIS has provided the best platform for detecting changes in land use and land cover classes. NDVI maps are created based on the cloud-based platform. These maps value ranges between -0.68 to -0.15, 0.76 to -0.29 and 0.66 to -0.11 in 2010, 2015 and 2020. Experimental outcomes indicate five classes such as water bodies, built up, barren, cropland and fallow land during 2010, 2015 and 2020. The overall accuracy of User and Producer for 2010, 2015 and 2019 years in between 86.23%, 88.34%, 85.53% and 92.51%, 94.34% and 91.54%, respectively. We have observed that (2010, 2015 - 2020) agriculture and built-up land increased by 1040.76 ha, 1246.32 ha, 1500.93 ha and 34.96 ha, 37.08 ha, 42.58 ha, respectively. Other side degraded land, fallow land, waterbodies areas (953.19 ha, 679.23 ha, 937.24 ha and 1385.73 ha, 1513.53 ha, 991.08 ha and 32.85 ha, 21.33 ha, 25.66 ha) are increased during the year of 2010, 2015 and 2020, respectively. While results have been done by GEE cloud platform and remote sensing data, this developed algorithm easily classified the land use maps from Landsat-5 and Sentinel-2 TM imagery in the machine learning approach. The determined 30-m and 10-m three-year LULC maps are made-up to deliver vital data on the changes, monitoring and understanding of which types of LULC classes and changes have occupied a place in the Rahuri area.

AB  - Background: Developing strategies to change health behaviour is one of the biggest challenges of health promotion programs. Social media, as a popular and innovative communication and education tool, offers opportunities to modify health behaviour. While literature on using social media for health promotion campaigns is growing, there is a need to evaluate the approaches used to change health behaviour, rather than only creating awareness. Objective: The paper reviewed the literature on application of social media in health promotion campaigns with a particular focus on the methodologies used in assessing the outcome of the programs for behaviour change. This fills the void in collating evidence to extend health promotion campaigns to effect sustainable behavioural change. Method: Peer-reviewed articles were identified through multiple science databases. A systematic electronic search was conducted to retrieve review and original papers published between January 2010 and April 2022. The titles and abstracts of the articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All authors independently read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes. Concept mapping was used to present results from analysis of the included papers. Results: Of the 674 citations, 28 (4.1%) studies were included in this review. The methodology approaches of 18 (2.7%) papers, that aimed to evaluate the impact of social media in health promotion campaigns towards behaviour change, were analysed further using concept mapping. The results showed that 10 studies (55.5%) adopted quantitative methods and five studies (27.7%) used mixed methods and three studies (16.6%) used qualitative methods. Facebook and YouTube were used more for intervention purposes to change health behaviour. Twitter and Instagram were used more to observe the trend of changes in health behaviour. Six studies (33.3%) adopted Social Cognitive Theory and one study (5.5%) applied the Transtheoretical Model as the framework to evaluate the outcome. Overall, the results show that though social media has potential in promoting behaviour change, the estimation of this change in long-term lies outside the scope of social media health campaigns. This is also reflected in the methodologies used in existing studies to assess such sustainable changes. The employed measures usually target immediate behaviour or social media engagement rather than addressing the change on a behavioural level. Conclusion: Evaluating the performance of social media campaigns to promote health behaviours towards a sustainable outcome is a complex process. Emerging research is focused on evaluating the potential of social media as an opportunity to create awareness. Such measures require less effort in quantifying and isolating the effect. The design of the campaigns is required to be aligned in relation to stages of the behaviour change. The study provides suggestions on how this can be achieved. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Sub-Saharan Africa secondary school science curricula recognise language as the most important communication tool for learners' biology learning outcomes. Despite this prominent goal, learners' scientific literacy at secondary school appears to be insufficient to cope with classroom teaching and learning of biology. This paper presents a review of literature regarding the way English as the language of instruction and inquiry-based learning strategies affect biology learning in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools. The scope of the review included journal articles, books and book chapters published in the period from 2005 to 2020 on the English language of instruction in biology education in Sub-Saharan Africa. We established criteria for first article searches indexed in Scopus, African Journals Online, the Education Resources Information Center, Web of Science and Psych Info as recognised index systems for science education. We considered studies related to the understanding of learners' language backgrounds, language-in-education policy and pedagogical language strategies (practice) that mediate learning. In this case, 53 studies were identified after removing redundancies; 27 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria when screened by key words and abstract and reviewed for eligibility; and only nine were selected after evaluating the full texts. The review analysis suggests that there is a gap in the corpus of literature on what and how pedagogical language strategies should be utilised to support meaningful learning of biology in multilingual settings. Poor learners' academic achievement and conceptual engagement in biology at secondary school level were the main effects reported by the reviewed literature. Less is still known about the effect of the use of inquiry-based learning strategies on learners' conceptual engagement in multilingual biology classrooms. We recommend formulating a clear policy articulation on the use of bilingual instructions in teaching and learning of biology at the secondary school level; assessing teacher and learner performance over pedagogical language strategies; and evaluating the contribution of IBL strategies in addressing language barriers in biology learning for higher order thinking skills in Sub-Saharan Africa secondary schools.

AB  - In this study, we conducted a holistic evaluation of current and future trend in coastal sea level at the 21 stations along Malaysia's coastline. For sea level prediction, univariate and 3 scenarios of multivariate Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks were trained with absolute sea level data and ocean-atmospheric variables. The result from the four scenario predictive models revealed that multivariate LSTM neural network trained with combined ocean-atmospheric variables performed best for modelling sea level variation, giving a mean RMSE and R accuracy of 0.060 and 0.861, respectively. The national sea level rise estimated from the average of sea level trend at all stations is 3.72 mm/yr for relative sea level and 3.68 mm/yr for absolute sea level. The 2050 and 2100 projections indicate that sea level will continue to rise but at a very slow rate with no acceleration. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

In foresight, qualification opportunities need to be implemented in order to train qualified specialists, referred to as the future quantum workforce, in various fields. Universities world-wide have launched qualification programmes for engineers focusing on quantum optics and photonics. In many of these programmes, students attend courses on quantum physics contextualized via quantum optics experiments with heralded photons, because: (1) their experimental and physical foundations may be directly leveraged to teaching a number of quantum technology applications, and (2) physics education research has provided empirical evidence, according to which such quantum optics-based approaches are conducive to learning about quantum concepts. While many teachers are confident about the effectiveness of their concepts, there is little empirical evidence due to the lack of content-area-specific research tools. We present a 16-item concept inventory to assess students' conceptual understanding of quantum optics concepts in the context of experiments with heralded photons adopted from a test instrument published in the literature. We have administered this Quantum Optics Concept Inventory as a post-test to N = 216 students after instruction on quantum optics as part of an undergraduate engineering course. We evaluated the instruments' psychometric quality, both in terms of classical test theory, and using a Rasch scaling approach. The Quantum Optics Concept Inventory enables a reliable measure ( α = 0.74 ), and the data gathered show a good fit to the Rasch model. The students' scores suggest that fundamental quantum effects pose striking learning hurdles to the engineering students. In contrast, most of the students are able to cope with the experimental and technical foundations of quantum optics experiments with heralded photons and their underlying principles, such as the coincidence technique used for the preparation of single-photon states. These findings are in accordance with prior research, and hence, the Quantum Optics Concept Inventory may serve as a fruitful starting point for future empirical research with regard to the education of the future quantum workforce.

AB  - Through the artistic planning tool known to comic book artists and animators as storyboarding, students will embark on comic book–style adventures to plan, describe, and visualize the complex life of genes through the non-Mendelian concept of epistasis. Using storyboard templates, conceptual layouts, sketch booking, and cut-out genetic elements, students will construct their interpretation of the gene-gene interactions of epistasis. The incomplete story of the epistasis of human eye color will serve as the theme for this storyboard, which will also become its own assessment tool, inviting educators into a realm of a true STEAM experience.

AB  - Objective: To determine the coalitions and impact of authors, countries, institutions, and journals, evaluate the knowledge base, find the hotspot trends, and identify the emerging topics in lumbar disc herniation (LDH). Method: The articles related to LDH were obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection on August 21, 2021. Two scientometric software (CiteSpace 5.8.R.1 and VOSviewer 1.6.17) were used to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis. Results: From the set parameters, 4642 articles were included in the literature. Although the total number of publications fluctuated between 2001 and 2020, a general trend toward increase was observed. Respectively, the most productive country and institution in the field were the United States and Wooridul Spine Hospital. The most active and cited authors were Lee and Weinstein. Spine was the most impactful and cited journal. Weinstein (JAMA 296:2441–2450, 2006) had the highest number of co-citations and Weinstein(N Engl J Med 358:794-810, 2008) had the highest number of citations. The keyword "low back pain" was ranked first for frequency and total link strength, whereas "risk factor" was ranked first for centrality. Topics including pathogenesis (disc herniation), examination methods (MRI), treatment methods (non-surgical treatment, surgical treatment), surgical options (laminectomy, discectomy), clinical observations (double-blind, efficacy, outcome, learning curve), and evaluation of efficacy (meta-analysis) of LDH have been the focus of leading-edge research in 2001–2020. Conclusion: Using bibliometric methods, this study mapped the knowledge map of LDH research in the past 20 years. The study identifies existing trends to provide a framework for further research.

AB  - Purpose: By envisioning the learning environment as an eco-social system, this study aims to map interrelated enablers of students' sustainability-oriented learning (SoL) in the context of a university course at the interface of science and society. Design/methodology/approach: A case-study approach was used to delineate what enables student learning in a university-wide transdisciplinary Master of Science course. A sample of 102 students, university and societal stakeholders participated to this study, by sharing their experiences and views through focus groups and questionnaires. Findings: A main finding is the development of a configuration of six intertwined enablers that through their interplay help to cultivate students' SoL, in the course under exploration. Originality/value: This study paves the way for a re-orientation of how to explore learning in complex environments. It shows that adopting a relational, situated and systems approach is not only feasible but is also desirable to understand and guide learning practices in complex environments.

AB  - Our civilization recognizes that errors can be valuable learning opportunities, but for decades, they have widely been avoided or, at best, allowed to occur as serendipitous accidents. The present research tested whether greater learning success could paradoxically be achieved through making errors by intentional design, relative to traditional errorless learning methods. We show that deliberately committing and correcting errors even when one knows the correct answers enhances learning—a counterintuitive phenomenon that we termed the derring effect. Across two experiments (N = 160), learners engaged in open-book study of scientific expository texts and were then tested on their retention and higher-order application of the material to analyze a novel news event. Deliberate error commission and correction during study produced not only better recall performance, but also superior knowledge application compared to two errorless study techniques that are popular among students and educational researchers: copying with underlining, and elaborative studying with concept mapping (Experiment 1). These learning benefits persisted even over generating alternative conceptually correct answers, revealing that the derring effect is not merely attributable to generation or elaboration alone, but is unique to producing incorrect responses (Experiment 2). Yet, learners were largely unaware of these advantages even after experiencing them. Our results suggest that avoiding errors in learning may not always be most optimal. Rather, deliberate erring is a powerful strategy to enhance meaningful learning. We discuss implications for educational practice in redesigning conventional approaches to errors: To err is human; to deliberately err is divine. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Errors are ripe with learning opportunity, but have traditionally been avoided or simply allowed to occur spontaneously. Here, we provide evidence for the derring effect—deliberately committing and correcting errors even when we know the correct answers enhances learning. Relative to popular errorless techniques such as copying with underlining, concept mapping, and even generating alternative correct answers, deliberate erring improved not only knowledge retention, but also higher-order application of learning. Yet, students were largely unaware of these benefits. Deliberate erring is a powerful way of learning from failure for greater success. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the past decade, sociologists have become increasingly interested in the formal study of semantic relations within text. Most contemporary studies focus either on mapping concept co-occurrences or on measuring semantic associations via word embeddings. Although conducive to many research goals, these approaches share an important limitation: they abstract away what one can call the event structure of texts, that is, the narrative action that takes place in them. I aim to overcome this limitation by introducing a new framework for extracting semantically rich relations from text that involves three components. First, a semantic grammar structured around textual entities that distinguishes six motif classes: actions of an entity, treatments of an entity, agents acting upon an entity, patients acted upon by an entity, characterizations of an entity, and possessions of an entity; second, a comprehensive set of mapping rules, which make it possible to recover motifs from predictions of dependency parsers; third, an R package that allows researchers to extract motifs from their own texts. The framework is demonstrated in empirical analyses on gendered interaction in novels and constructions of collective identity by U.S. presidential candidates. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Explanation of natural phenomena at one level of biological organisation almost always involves causes that are found at other levels. Although scientists thinking across levels find it easy to explain physiological phenomena, students often perceive this as a challenge. We developed a new graphic organiser called Zoom Map, which is a mode for structuring biological information along the levels of biological organisation and is designed to guide biology students when they need to consider the levels of organisation. The aim of this study is to examine how Zoom Map helps students explain a common phenomenon in plant physiology: leaves that are upright or wilted. Accordingly, we designed a teaching experiment covering 13 students. During the experiments, the students were videotaped. We used qualitative content analysis to examine the explanations. Our findings indicate that Zoom Map improved students’ explanations of the phenomenon across multiple levels of organisation: The students used more levels than before, and they referred to lower levels that were lacking previously. Therefore, it can be concluded that students who use Zoom Map are supported in their ability to explain a biological phenomenon across the levels of biological organisation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The use of augmented reality (AR) technology in the science curriculum has the potential to assist students in comprehending abstract and complex concepts or unobservable phenomena, as well as to better explain knowledge regarding science content by superimposing virtual objects over genuine items or environments in a multidimensional approach. However, the overall effects on students' academic achievement of using AR technology in scientific courses and the key factors that influence such effects are still unclear. Therefore, we performed a meta-analysis in this work to systematically review 35 empiric trials (with 39 effect sizes) that used experimental or quasi-experimental approaches to determine the academic achievement of using AR techniques in science-related courses. In addition, we explored possible moderators such as differences in disciplines, educational stages, types of AR (marker-based, markerless-based, or location-based), display devices (mobiles, tablets, computers, or headsets), intervention duration, group size, and instructional strategies. The results revealed that the overall mean effect size (with AR into instruction vs without AR into instruction) was 0.737 under the random effects model, indicating a medium-to-large significant positive effect on students' academic achievement. The disciplines had significant moderating effects, types of AR had marginally significant effects, while educational stages, display devices, intervention duration, group size, and strategies used had insignificant influence. The impact of AR technology on scientific education was discussed in connection to the above seven moderators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students—even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - It is the responsibility of colleges and universities to nurture talents for the country. In the final analysis, the purpose of teaching, scientific research, and social services in colleges and universities is to educate people. The study of labor education, in the face of the important historical opportunity of transformation, is a theoretical representation of labor education and its value choice. The answer to this question can help us clarify the meaning of labor education and improve the scientific and systematic practice of labor education. Labor education in colleges and universities has an important and extensive value significance for cultivating contemporary college students, which can not only inspire students to study hard in science and culture, master their skills, and grow their talents but also guide them to firm ideals and beliefs, exercise good character, and cultivate the emotional experience of labor so that contemporary college students can integrate the pursuit of life values with the great cause of national prosperity and national rejuvenation and integrate the beautiful vision of personal ambition and family happiness with the good cause of collective, social, and national interests. This paper is based on the background of the times. Therefore, this paper studies the labor culture and ecological environment from the background of the times: the path of renewing the concept of "cultivating talents for the nation" in labor education. It also gives a profound discussion on labor education in high schools and finally puts forward relevant suggestions for the problems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this paper, to handle the problem of the quick evolution of cyber-security attacks, we developed the iMonsters board game and proposed the attack and defense knowledge self-evolving algorithm. Three versions of the iMonsters were launched in 2013, 2017, and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, the cyber-security ontology can be refined by the ontology fusion-or-splitting procedure for the newly collected cyber-security incidents, as well as the roles and rules of the iMonsters can be refined by the gaming portfolio mining procedure for the collected portfolio. Furthermore, we conducted game-based learning (GBL), a quasi-experiment of pre/post-testing, and concept map testing using the iMonsters board game in a children’s summer camp. The experimental results indicate that the students can acquire up-to-date cyber-security knowledge with the iMonsters better than students who learn in a traditional classroom setting, and the students’ satisfaction with acquiring cyber-security knowledge with the instructional design of the iMonsters is better compared with learning in a traditional classroom setting. Satisfaction with the new version has continuously increased. Besides, the results of the in-depth interviews show that the new version was easier to learn. Thus, we may conclude that using the self-evolving iMonsters can improve learning effectiveness and participation in GBL. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Nowadays, patients with chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension have reached alarming numbers worldwide. These diseases increase the risk of developing acute complications and involve a substantial economic burden and demand for health resources. The widespread adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is opening great opportunities for supporting decision-making. Nevertheless, data extracted from EHRs are complex (heterogeneous, high-dimensional and usually noisy), hampering the knowledge extraction with conventional approaches. Methods: We propose the use of the Denoising Autoencoder (DAE), a Machine Learning (ML) technique allowing to transform high-dimensional data into latent representations (LRs), thus addressing the main challenges with clinical data. We explore in this work how the combination of LRs with a visualization method can be used to map the patient data in a two-dimensional space, gaining knowledge about the distribution of patients with different chronic conditions. Furthermore, this representation can be also used to characterize the patient's health status evolution, which is of paramount importance in the clinical setting. Results: To obtain clinical LRs, we considered real-world data extracted from EHRs linked to the University Hospital of Fuenlabrada in Spain. Experimental results showed the great potential of DAEs to identify patients with clinical patterns linked to hypertension, diabetes and multimorbidity. The procedure allowed us to find patients with the same main chronic disease but different clinical characteristics. Thus, we identified two kinds of diabetic patients with differences in their drug therapy (insulin and non-insulin dependant), and also a group of women affected by hypertension and gestational diabetes. We also present a proof of concept for mapping the health status evolution of synthetic patients when considering the most significant diagnoses and drugs associated with chronic patients. Conclusion: Our results highlighted the value of ML techniques to extract clinical knowledge, supporting the identification of patients with certain chronic conditions. Furthermore, the patient's health status progression on the two-dimensional space might be used as a tool for clinicians aiming to characterize health conditions and identify their more relevant clinical codes.

AB  - Scientific modeling is a practice that we use frequently in our undergraduate biomedical applications course for nonscience majors. We use case studies in which students apply course concepts to create cause-and-effect models. In this article, we describe a case study assessment on protein synthesis that examines the use of CRISPR to bring back the mammoth (i.e., de-extinction). Students learn about protein synthesis throughout the course and work on various case study scenarios to apply those concepts. Their final assessment is a team project to illustrate how protein synthesis is influenced by gene editing, including gene expression and its regulation, transcription, translation, protein structure and function, and the ultimate impact on an organism's phenotype. Although we use this case study as an assessment, it is also appropriate as a class activity in which students practice modeling the CRISPR gene-editing system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous research has illustrated the potential of flipped learning for assisting teachers in designing meaningful activities to promote students' higher order thinking skills; however, several previous studies have challenged the effects of flipped learning on students' learning. One of the key problems is the lack of an effective learning approach or tools to engage students in the flipped learning activity. In this study, a concept mapping-based Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE) approach was incorporated into flipped learning (called CPOE-FL) to enhance students' scientific learning. Furthermore, a three-group experiment was conducted to assess the effects of the three flipped learning models, comprising the CPOE-FL approach, the POE-FL (incorporating POE into flipped learning) approach, and the C-FL (conventional flipped learning) approach. The experimental results displayed that the CPOE-FL approach can benefit the learning achievements and self-efficacy of the students with respectively lower prior knowledge and lower initial self-efficacy, in comparison with the POE-FL and C-FL approaches. Both the CPOE-FL and POE-FL approaches promoted the students' inner learning motivation, while the CPOE-FL approach enhanced the students' critical thinking. This proposed approach could provide a good reference for researchers or school teachers intending to implement POE-based flipped learning in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - (1) Background: spatial thinking is indirectly applied in numerous daily activities (e.g., when defining the route when going to school/work) or in scientific areas (e.g., predicting the spatial–temporal spread of contagious diseases), and its ability might be improved using geographical information systems (GIS). The main objective of this study was to perform an analysis of the spatial thinking of students in two curricular units (CUs) that had come from different background areas; (2) Methods: to that end, the Spatial Thinking Ability Test (STAT), composed of 15 multiple choice questions to measure spatial thinking, was given to 83 students before and after exposure to GIS concepts and software. Students' answers were analyzed question-by-question and as total scores. The statistical analysis was performed using the paired samples t-test, the independent samples t-test or the Mann–Whitney statistical test and the nonparametric Kruskal–Wallis test; (3) Results: an overall significant improvement was observed from the pre- to the post-test. Additionally, total scores were not significantly different between students of different CUs, courses, or genders; (4) Conclusions: this exploratory study can be considered as a support methodology for pedagogical didactics that have been implemented in the CUs and may be readily applied in other academic environments, namely with students from different backgrounds, countries, and teaching strategies, thus promoting the discussion of all such experiences and consequent improvement in geographical education.

AB  - Ethical decision-making and professional behavior are essential skills in nursing profession, hence educational programs should be designed to enable future nurses to tackle problems related to ethical decision-making. This descriptive, correlational and analytical study aimed at determining the ability of Iranian nursing students to make ethical decisions as well as relationship between such decisions and professional behavior. The present study used census to select 140 freshmen from the School of Nursing and Midwifery of Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran. Data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, the Nursing Dilemma Test (NDT) comprising two indices of “nurse’s principled thinking” and “practical consideration”, as well as the Nursing Students Professional Behaviors Scale (NSPBS). The mean scores obtained were 41.3±5.7 for “nurse’s principled thinking”, 21.3±3.7 for “practical consideration”, and 119.07±11.79 for professional behavior. Relationships of professional behavior with “nurse’s principled thinking” and “practical consideration” were insignificant (P>0.05). According to the present study’s findings, nursing students’ weakness in applying ethical concepts to decisions and professional behaviors was due to a gap between scientific material learned and clinical practice. Hence, novel training strategies and programs should be designed to reduce such theorypractice gap. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Location -based learning refers to place-based education conducted online with the use of geographic information systems and mobile devices; with the shift to distance learning, its integration in science education warrants careful evaluation. The goal of this study was to examine the effect of location-based learning on students' understanding of Newton's laws of motion and to characterize the learning outcomes. The participants were 373 eighth-grade students, divided into two groups: control (n = 167) — teacher-centered, textbook-oriented instruction — and experimental (n = 206) — student-centered, location-based learning. The study applied a quasi-experimental research design, within a framework of a mixed-methods approach, in which data were collected through pre- and post-questionnaires and the analysis of students' learning outcomes. The findings indicated a significant positive effect for the location-based learning approach on students' ability to generate and answer science-related questions, provide reasoned explanations, and connect scientific topics to daily life. Significant relationships were indicated between students' ability to generate questions and their ability to provide reasoned explanations. The study points to the importance of engaging students in location-based learning and in the process of generating science-related questions, information points on a digital map, and multimedia features.

AB  - Scientific inquiry is a central area of competence in Chemistry education. The structure of scientific inquiry is at the core of it. If students are to reflect about their scientific inquiries, they need to have methodological knowledge about the different steps of scientific inquiry. Studies indicate that such knowledge should be taught explicitly in the classroom. The concept at hand explains the role of each step of scientific inquiry, it describes the characteristics of each step (methodological knowledge) and it applies these characteristics to a specific experiment from the curriculum using a check list. This underlines the strong connection between scientific ways of thinking and scientific methods. As such, it is the first concept to coherently present instructional material for students age 11–15, that focusses on methodological knowledge about scientific inquiry as learning objective. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Naturwissenschaftliche Erkenntnisgewinnung ist ein zentraler Kompetenzbereich des Chemieunterrichts. Das Herzstück stellt der Weg der Erkenntnisgewinnung dar. Für die reflektierte Nutzung des Weges der Erkenntnisgewinnung ist die Vermittlung von deklarativem Wissen über die einzelnen Schritte nötig. Wie Studien nahelegen, sollte dieses Methodenwissen explizit vermittelt werden. Das hier präsentierte Vermittlungskonzept zeigt für jeden Schritt die Bedeutung auf dem Weg der Erkenntnisgewinnung auf, benennt die Merkmale des Schrittes (Methodenwissen) und wendet das Methodenwissen in Form eines Merkmalschecks auf ein lehrplanrelevantes, experimentelles Beispiel an. Das unterstreicht die enge Verzahnung von Denkweisen (Methodenwissen) und Arbeitsweisen (Fachmethoden). Damit liegt erstmals ein Vermittlungskonzept für den Chemieunterricht der Sekundarstufe I vor, das den Weg der Erkenntnisgewinnung selbst zum Lernziel macht. (German) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The necessity to use renewable energy sources (RES), especially in EU countries, is becoming more and more urgent in the face of environmental degradation. It is reflected not only in technological solutions for obtaining energy from renewable sources, but also in scientific research supporting RES technology development. There are an increasing number of papers on renewable energy. The aim of the study was to compare research areas concerning renewable energy in Poland and other EU countries by analyzing scientific works. A selected collection of publications available in the Scopus scientific databases was selected as the subject of the study. After cleaning the data and elaborating the thesaurus, the analysis of the article content was conducted applying text processing methods. Conceptual maps of keywords and keyword co-occurrences were created, which enables arranging and classifying knowledge from the subject area. Research hotspots and the directions of science development in the field of renewable energy were identified. The computer program VOSviewer was used in the investigation. Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients were used to identify quite a strong concentration of RES articles in leading journals on the publication market. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Though concept maps and graphic organisers are useful tools for bilinguals to organise the information being managed and learned, its systematic use is not widened and decisive in CLIL domains. Apart from helping students to acquire meaningful learning, concept mapping might promote in them word-recognition skills for the identification and management of relevant information within foreign language (L2) texts. Hence, this article inquires into the influence of concept maps and graphic organisers as tools for noun category identification from L2 texts. Research sample comprises sixty Spanish primary education students from a bilingual school. Design is quasi-experimental, and the training programme lasted three weeks. Materials used during the training period are not exceptional, but the ordinarily found in regular classrooms. Data gathering procedure consists of the identification and circling of nouns by sample participants. As a starting point, secondary data as the intelligent quotient, learning style, and English level is collected via standardised tests. The analysis of the variance showed a highly significant interaction between the groups and the implemented texts both for noun identification (F3.171 = 12.124, p < 0.000, η2 = 0.175), and the grammatical categories mistakenly identified as nouns (F3.171 = 3.840, p < 0.016, η2 = 0.063).

AB  - This study was designed to investigate the moderating effect of cognitive ability level on the efficacy of Dialogic and VARK instructional strategies for improving science students’ selfefficacy in Biology. Guided by three research questions and two hypotheses, the study adopted experimental research design, and involved 954 class 5 Biology students in Nigeria secondary (High) schools. A 40-item achievement test was used to determine baseline cognitive ability level of the students, and an adapted self-efficacy scale was used to collect pre-test and post-test selfefficacy data, which was analysed using SPSS v24, to determine the mean, standard deviation and p-values. Results revealed that dialogic and VARK pedagogies were significantly efficacious for improving science students’ self-efficacy, with the dialogic pedagogy being more efficacious than the VARK. The study also showed that the influence of cognitive ability on the efficacy of these two pedagogies was not significant. It is recommended that science teachers consider self-efficacy an important factor that influences learning outcomes, and so design their lessons such that would stimulate students’ confidence in their ability to grasp the concepts being taught. Adopting dialogic and/or VARK pedagogy which has proven efficacious can help science teachers build up students’ self-efficacy. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Self-efficacy entails the belief that an individual has the ability to carry out certain actions that will result in the desired outcome. Teachersâ€™ self-efficacy is, therefore, the teachersâ€™ confidence in their ability to promote studentsâ€™ learning. This study examined the impact of teachersâ€™ self-efficacy on academic achievement in Biology among secondary school students in Enugu State using an expost facto research design. From a population of 5693 (2254 females and 3439 males) SS1 Biology students and 62 SS1 Biology teachers in all the 48 public senior secondary schools in Obollo A for Education Zone of Enugu state, a sample of 270 SS1 Biology students and 25 SS1 Biology teachers were selected through purposeful sampling technique. The instruments used for data collection were the Teachersâ€™ Self-Efficacy Index (TSEI)), Biology Achievement Test (BAT) and Eysenck General Intelligence Test (EGIT). Three research questions were answered in the study while Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to test the three hypotheses that guided the study at 0.05 level significance. The results of the study found out that: students who were taught by teachers of high and moderate Teachersâ€™ self-efficacy levels had better academic achievement when compared with those students whose teachers exhibited low Teachersâ€™ self-efficacy; that male and female students did not show any significant difference in academic achievement in Biology based on teacher Teachersâ€™ self-efficacy behaviour. It was recommended that a favourable climate and conducive working atmosphere be put in place to ensure effective process of teaching and learning Biology using TSE.

T1  - Mapping Gully Erosion Variability and Susceptibility Using Remote Sensing, Multivariate Statistical Analysis, and Machine Learning in South Mato Grosso, Brazil.

AB  - In Brazil, the development of gullies constitutes widespread land degradation, especially in the state of South Mato Grosso, where fighting against this degradation has become a priority for policy makers. However, the environmental and anthropogenic factors that promote gully development are multiple, interact, and present a complexity that can vary by locality, making their prediction difficult. In this framework, a database was constructed for the Rio Ivinhema basin in the southern part of the state, including 400 georeferenced gullies and 13 geo-environmental descriptors. Multivariate statistical analysis was performed using principal component analysis (PCA) to identify the processes controlling the variability in gully development. Susceptibility maps were created through four machine learning models: multivariate discriminant analysis (MDA), logistic regression (LR), classification and regression tree (CART), and random forest (RF). The predictive performance of the models was analyzed by five evaluation indices: accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SST), specificity (SPF), precision (PRC), and Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC curve). The results show the existence of two major processes controlling gully erosion. The first is the surface runoff process, which is related to conditions of slightly higher relief and higher rainfall. The second also reflects high surface runoff conditions, but rather related to high drainage density and downslope, close to the river network. Human activity represented by peri-urban areas, construction of small earthen dams, and extensive rotational farming contribute significantly to gully formation. The four machine learning models yielded fairly similar results and validated susceptibility maps (ROC curve > 0.8). However, we noted a better performance of the random forest (RF) model (86% and 89.8% for training and test, respectively, with an ROC curve value of 0.931). The evaluation of the contribution of the parameters shows that susceptibility to gully erosion is not governed primarily by a single factor, but rather by the interconnection between different factors, mainly elevation, geology, precipitation, and land use.

AB  - Leadership Education Development (LED) teaching results in criticism and debate in the learning atmosphere for students. The significant challenges in LED are analyzing how research can successfully be applied to benefit the students' teaching, the political essence of education, identifying education research as a science, and the dislocation between educational research and education practice. Teaching and research are two critical ties to tertiary education programs. Two psychological tools have been built from archived research data and show how this form of reuse allows pedagogue to directly link research and teaching. This manuscript proposed an Optimized Learning Strategy (OLS) to improve curriculum development. OLS provides strategies for learning that increase learning ability, learning experience, boost understanding, and connect with previous knowledge of new information. This paper presents the real practice of the development of LED teaching programming. Finally, the results show the students highly recommended OLS based on case study analysis to measure teaching and learning methods. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article critically discusses the ecology of public schools in the United States: systemic barriers and associated biases that permeate these learning contexts and derail efforts to close opportunity gaps for African American adolescents with emotional and behavioral challenges. Using results from a mixed-methods study, we illustrate the ubiquity of an a-developmental perspective that guides perceptions of what is needed to keep these students in and successful at school. A close examination of school mental health providers' perceptions of what is important and feasible in public school contexts shows recommended interventions to be necessary but not sufficient. We highlight important considerations in the reframing of schools as a dynamic developmental system and conclude with recommendations about how to harness adolescents' strengths to generate strategies that move us toward more equitable and socially just schooling.

T1  - What's Public About Publicly-Funded Universities? The Law and Politics of Extending Charter Protections to Campus Expression.

AB  - The law and policy of free expression on Canadian university campuses is in a state of flux. Despite universities comfortably avoiding the Charter due to inconsistent provincial rulings and an insufficient connection to "government," Charter applicability has gradually become a serious possibility. Two changes, in particular, indicate that the status quo of Charter avoidance on campus is evolving: a legal decision in Alberta concerning the pre-emptive curtailment of student expression due to security concerns (UAlberta Pro-Life v University of Alberta), and ministerial directives compelling postsecondary institutions to institute explicit free expression policies in Alberta and Ontario. This article analyzes the consequences of Charter avoidance -- including the publicprivate dimension, which underlies debates about extending constitutional protections for expression to campus -- and argues for Charter applicability in the public-oriented domains of campuses (i.e. quads and other common areas). The article begins by diagnosing a constitutive tension between reasonable limits on expression derived from constitutional law and additional institutional latitude to restrict expression as a result of administrative law. It does this through a conceptual mapping that contrasts expressive limits that apply generally and those that apply specifically on campus. Next, it argues that free expression is an important academic value, consistent with the essentially public and democratic essence of the university. Here, it makes the case that arguments against extending constitutional protections for expression to university campuses -- based on a distinction between free expression and free inquiry -- have the consequence of contributing to a private-oriented vision of the university. Lastly, the article analyzes relevant case law to argue that there are also compelling legal reasons for Charter applicability, which would create necessary consistency across provincial jurisdictions and help address the constitutive tension that affects expressive limits on campus. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Le droit et les politiques de la liberté d'expression sur les campus universitaires canadiens sont en pleine évolution. Bien que les universités ne soient pas soumises aux dispositions de la Charte, en raison de décisions judiciaires provinciales incohérentes et d'un lien insuffisant avec le « gouvernement », l'application de la Charte sur les campus est néanmoins progressivement devenue une sérieuse possibilité. Deux changements, en particulier, indiquent que le statu quo de la non-application de la Charte sur les campus universitaires est en train d' évoluer: un jugement en Alberta concernant la limitation préventive de l'expression des étudiants pour des raisons de sécurité (UAlberta Pro-Life v. University of Alberta) et des directives ministérielles obligeant les établissements postsecondaires à instituer des politiques explicites de libre expression en Alberta et en Ontario. Cet article analyse les conséquences de la non-application de la Charte -- y compris la dimension publique-privée, qui sous-tend les débats sur l'extension aux campus des protections constitutionnelles en matière d'expression -- et plaide pour l'applicabilité de la Charte dans les domaines publics des campus (c'est-à-dire les aires communes). L'article débute par diagnostiquer une tension entre les limites raisonnables d'expression dérivées du droit constitutionnel et la latitude institutionnelle supplémentaire pour restreindre l'expression en raison du droit administratif. Pour ce faire, il établit une cartographie conceptuelle, qui oppose les limites d'expression qui s'appliquent de manière générale à celles qui s'appliquent spécifiquement aux campus. Ensuite, il soutient que la liberté d'expression est une valeur académique importante, cohérente avec la nature essentiellement publique et démocratique de l'université. Il fait valoir que les arguments contre l'extension aux campus universitaires des protections constitutionnelles en matière d'expression -- fondés sur une distinction entre la liberté d'expression et la liberté de recherche -- ont pour conséquence de contribuer à une conception davantage privée de l'université. Enfin, l'article analyse la jurisprudence pertinente pour faire valoir qu' il existe également des raisons juridiques convaincantes en faveur de l'applicabilité de la Charte sur les campus universitaires, ce qui créerait une nécessaire cohérence entre les juridictions provinciales et aiderait à résoudre la tension qui affecte les limites d'expression sur les campus.

AB  - This essay aims to share with the community of practice an approach for incorporating and embedding Futures and scenarios into business school curriculum as part of strategy development practice with a view to strike a balance between scientific rigour and practical relevance of management education. Through the conduct of a 3-day Foresight for Strategy Development workshop curated for as an intensive course for a cohort of DBA students at the Narxoz Business School, Almaty, Kazakhstan, the author describes the step-by-step process of building scenarios and shares some of the learning outcomes from the workshop. The 3-day workshop was designed with two objectives; that is, to teach the basic skills of futures thinking by introducing futures studies, and to incorporate the five stages of scenario development process as part of strategic planning practice. While students learned the reasons for and the process of embedding scenarios as a planning tool, and were able to apply theory to practice in classroom exercises, this cohort of DBA students found it quite challenging to have a proper grasp of Futures concepts and methodologies. They were overwhelmed by the amount of contents they have to process within the space of a 3-day intensive workshop. This feedback was not peculiar to this cohort of students and it was a common lament received from the various workshops conducted in different countries including Malaysia, United Arab Emirates, Taiwan, Bahrain and Oman. This was particularly true with those in the developing economies where futures studies is relatively a new discipline. This experience tells us there is an opportunity to fill this void by introducing and embedding futures studies and scenarios as part of the planning and strategy development in Management courses in Kazakhstan.

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative study conducted using the Glaserian grounded theory (GT) method. Glaser's approach to GT differs from Strauss and Corbin's method, which is more widespread. There are some differences in the focus on participants' concerns, staying in the research environment for an extended period to discover participants' main concerns and the emergence of a basic social process around the core category. The Glaserian GT method was used to understand elite athletes' lifestyles. Two groups of athletes and non-athletes were recruited for the interview as the sample. The core category was determined through iterative coding, memoing, theoretical sampling, and theoretical sorting. There were overlaps in these phases; they fluctuated back and forth and were not as clear-cut as they could be. Results showed the lifestyle components of elite athletes. Besides identifying participants' main concerns, the results also demonstrated how to address them over time. It is a category of a basic social process named "professionalizing." Lastly, the steps of creating a concept map are explained practically, which in addition to sports science scholars, can be considered by researchers in other fields. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Scholars and researchers generally believe that scientific inquiry is an important activity for cultivating students' applied knowledge and high‐level thinking ability. The process of scientific inquiry can promote students' learning motivation and trigger their higher‐order thinking ability. However, students may not have enough prior knowledge or they may lack inquiry experience, which may influence the effectiveness of their inquiry learning. Besides, in a scientific inquiry environment assisted by technology, students must face abundant and diverse learning resources, and may not effectively organize and carry out advanced cogitation to solve problems. Therefore, this research proposed an integrated concept mapping and image recognition (IR) approach to help students effectively acquire and organize knowledge in the process of scientific inquiry. This study applied a quasi‐experimental design to verify the effect of this proposed approach. The experimental group conducted the concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach, whilst the control group conducted the conventional IR‐based learning approach to evaluate the students' performance in terms of their learning motivation and learning achievements. The participants were two classes of 10th‐grade students in northern Taiwan. One was the experimental group with 22 students, whilst the other was the control group with 22 students. The experimental results show that the students learning with the CM‐IR learning approach had better learning achievement, attitudes and intrinsic motivation, as well as higher mental load than those learning with the conventional IR‐based learning approach. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided for future research in this field. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicWith the development of information technology, AI has attracted the attention of researchers.Image recognition (IR) is one of the AI applications, and has been used to support learning in various educational fields.Researchers have indicated that concept mapping is an effective instructional strategy and promotes students' knowledge construction.What this paper addsA concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach is proposed to improve students' scientific inquiry performance.A quasi‐experimental design was conducted with 10th‐grade students on the 'Plant identification' unit of the scientific inquiry course.The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve students' learning achievement, learning motivation and learning attitude.Implications for practice and/or policyThe CM‐IR learning approach could be an effective method to facilitate students' learning performances and motivation in scientific inquiry.It is worth promoting the CM‐IR learning approach in school settings since it is low‐cost and enables learning anywhere using mobile devices.Scholars and educators are encouraged to work on how AI technologies applications can be applied to support learning.

AB  - Purpose: Libraries, museums and cultural centers have long served as cultural ambassadors and foreign policy instruments, bridging diplomatic relationships among nation-states and institutions. The purpose of this scoping review is to ascertain and understand the emerging areas of research on libraries, museums and cultural centers in foreign policy and cultural diplomacy within broader research paradigms of international relations, social sciences, education and library and information studies by systematically mapping key concepts and identifying the types of studies and knowledge gaps. Design/methodology/approach: Using the Joanna Briggs Institute's (JBI) Manual for Evidence Synthesis, relevant peer-reviewed journal articles, books and book chapters that were published over a wide time period in any language from various databases were systematically examined. Two reviewers worked independently to extract the data and reached a consensus regarding the inclusion criteria using the JBI's data charting template. Findings: In total, 6,436 citations were screened, and 57 documents were identified as eligible for inclusion. The following sequences were reviewed and explored: study characteristics, theoretical approaches and research themes. The research themes were grouped into broader ones that included goals, actors, strategies and instruments. Finally, the concentration and clusters of ideas and gaps that emerged in the identified studies were investigated, resulting in a discussion of the recommendations and directions for future research. Originality/value: This first scoping review is a useful tool for investigating the changing and novel roles of libraries, museums and cultural centers in cultural diplomacy and foreign policy. Although substantial work exists on the topic, the potential remains for interdisciplinary research to challenge and extend the current knowledge about cultural diplomacy practices in libraries, museums and cultural centers.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is attracting increasing attention, but how to improve students’ STEM learning achievement is still a big challenge. In the process of learning, students actively set learning goals, organize learning content, set learning standards, and independently adapt learning strategies and monitoring measures in order to achieve their own learning goals and to help them learn STEM knowledge and skills. Concept mapping is considered to be an effective visualized knowledge organizing tool that helps students to manage and organize their knowledge systematically and visually. This study proposes a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning approach. A quasi-experiment was conducted using a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning system in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improved students’ STEM skills, but not their STEM knowledge compared to the conventional self-regulated learning approach. The proposed learning approach helped to improve students’ self-regulation compared to the conventional self-regulation learning approach. In short, the concept mapping-based self-regulation learning approach enhances students’ self-efficacy and self-regulation, which in turn helps students to learn STEM skills effectively.

AB  - The present article represents a mini-review and a reflective essay concerning modern medical education methods, as well as ways to adapt them to medical education's local conditions (disciplines), including basic medical sciences. We introduced Gagné's theory of learning and other theories – Constructivist, Experiential, and Humanistic – followed by Dennik's "twelve tips" for effective learning and Harden's ten questions for curriculum development. Outcome-based education (OBE) was discussed and related to relevant concepts within Miller's pyramid and Bloom's taxonomy. Harden's SPICES model was emphasized concerning education strategies while discussing the assessment of learning (AoL), assessment as learning (AaL), and assessment for learning (AfL). Finally, the authors advise exploring the adaptation of modern education methods for a specifi c discipline of basic medical sciences – Human Anatomy – by incorporating the abovementioned concepts and integrating different AfL and AaL assessment tools while conveying a graphical concept map for this scenario.

AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a valuable learning experience for a feedback provider. However, different types of products require different types of feedback, which, in turn, may lead to different learning outcomes. The current study investigates the effect on the learning of feedback providers of reviewing different types of products. Secondary school students (n =127) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: giving peer feedback on either concept maps or answers to open-ended test questions. Both types of product, created by the researchers, were comparable with regard to content: they included the same misconceptions and were both of average quality. Giving peer feedback was part of a chemistry lesson delivered in an online inquiry learning environment. Students' post-test scores, their own learning products, and the quality of the provided feedback were analysed to check for an effect on learning. There was no difference in post-test scores between the conditions, but the quality of the provided feedback predicted post-test scores. This indicates that it is not the type of product reviewed that matters, but the effort that students put into giving feedback. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study explores teachers' conceptions of STEM education at the beginning of an online graduate course for practicing PK-12 teachers (n=20). A grounded theory approach was used to analyze open-ended survey data and concept maps. Teachers in the study interpreted STEM teaching from either a disciplinary or an integrated perspective. Their conceptions of STEM education within their concept maps fell into one or more of six categories: (1) utilitarian; (2) acquisition of disciplinary knowledge; (3) activities and resources; (4) access to meaningful problem-solving experiences; (5) advocacy for systemic change; and (6) buzzwords. This study reveals the complexity of teachers' conceptions of STEM education as they prepare to integrate STEM in their classrooms. The use of concept maps as a formative assessment can better position teacher educators and professional developers to move teachers toward a more sustainable integrated perspective of STEM teaching.

AB  - Based on the concept of responsible holistic nursing care, a whole-process dual-tutor nursing practice model is established and its application effects are explored. This paper firstly reviews the research progress of nursing workload prediction methods at home and abroad, in order to provide a reference for clinical nursing workers in China to choose a scientific, reasonable, and easy-to-use nursing workload prediction method. It is proposed to construct a nursing education management model based on small data to provide ideas and references for nursing education management to effectively predict the evolutionary trend of students' behaviour and improve the level of accurate services. The experimental group adopted a dual-tutor responsibility system for the whole-process nursing practice model, including a complete three-level supervision system: a dual-tutor teaching system, a PDCA responsibility system for continuous improvement, and a multichannel teacher-student interaction platform; the control group adopted the traditional nursing practice model.

AB  - As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience specifically on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simplified complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

AB  - Concept mapping (CM) is widely used in educational settings as a teaching/learning or assessment tool. We conducted a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to provide an updated review on CM research in computer-supported learning environments. A total of 356 selected studies published from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed from the Web of Science database. The findings revealed an increasing and continuous focus on CM research. The leading journal for publishing CM research was <italic>Computers & Education</italic>, and the United States was the country with the most published studies. The most frequently used keywords were categorized into four clusters to represent the four main themes of CM research. Subsequent analysis showed that the most applied learning subject was environmental science or natural science; traditional computers/devices were the most used devices/hardware; higher education students were the most used samples; quantitative methods were the most used research methods; computers as mindtools were the most adopted learning strategy; and concept mapping assessment was the most used measurement tool in the CM research. These findings reveal the trends of CM research and provide future research directions and applications of practical education for researchers and educators. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Muslim populations in Western countries are growing, and they face biopsychosocial, spiritual, and economic challenges. Although Islam gives utmost attention to mental health stability, Muslims tend to underutilize mental health services. Mental health professionals, whether they be researchers, practitioners, or trainers working in schools, colleges/universities, mental health agencies, and research institutions, are well positioned to serve Muslims. Mental health professionals can address Muslims' biopsychosocial and spiritual issues and enhance their quality of life. In the current study, as the authors, we (a) reviewed 300 peer-reviewed manuscripts on Muslim mental health to understand how researchers have used concept maps or theoretical frameworks to design their empirical research, (b) prepared a comprehensive concept map based on the literature review to determine the central concepts affecting Muslims' approach to the use of mental health services, and (c) proposed a contextual theoretical (conceptual) framework. We titled the framework as Muslims' approach to use of mental health services based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TPB/TRA) in the context of a Social Ecological Model (SEM). We drew the framework based on TPB/TRA, SEM, and the review of Muslim mental health literature (the concept map). The concept map and the framework provide the most important constructs about challenges Muslim's face when attempting to utilize mental health services. Future researchers can use the concept map and the framework to conduct theoretically and evidence-based grounded empirical research. We provided implications for researchers, practitioners, educators, and social advocates wishing to contribute to service provision to this population. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigates the roles, applications, and trends of concept map-supported education (CMSE) by reviewing the studies published from 1992 to 2020. Several dimensions, such as the media of concept maps, roles of concepts, sample groups, research methods, application domains, learning contexts, research foci, as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account based on the technology-based learning model. From the review results, two thematic clusters were found, namely concept map-facilitated knowledge construction in collaborative learning, and concept map-based learning design to improve learning achievement and motivation. The research focused more on the applications in engineering courses, followed by science and language courses, and potential was also found in arts, business or management, and mathematics. Learning contexts for CMSE are mainly in-class activities, followed by online discussion activities; moreover, it was found that the number of applications in digital game-based learning contexts is increasing. In terms of research foci, more studies investigated learners’ performance, attitude/motivation, and perceptions, while less emphasis was put on developing learners’ skills, higher order thinking, as well as collaboration and communication competences. Accordingly, several suggestions for future research of CMSE are provided as a reference for researchers and policy makers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The body of knowledge constituting cartography and the geosciences comprises a large number of concepts, sharing relationships with each other at multiple levels of conceptual hierarchy. Becoming aware of these relationships can likely help people in their studies of these disciplines in multiple ways. Educational node-link diagrams (Figure 1), which are often called concept maps, have the potential to provide such an understanding to people who interact with them. Sharing with traditional cartography, a synoptic communication style, concept maps include points called nodes, representing concepts and lines representing relationships between the concepts associated with the nodes they connect. Arrows often append the linking lines, indicating directional relationships between the concepts. (Nesbit & Adesope, 2006; Novak, 2011; Kriegelstein et al., 2022; Schroeder et al., 2018). Significant empirical evidence supports the educational effectiveness of concept maps. Schroeder et al. (2018) meta-analysed 63 studies that experimentally compared learning with concept maps to learning with other instructional forms. Various forms of learning with concept maps was found to be more effective, with moderate to large effect sizes, indicated by Hedge's g values, than learning with lectures, discussions, prose texts, lists, or outlines. These findings corroborate those of a previous similar meta-analysis carried out by Nesbit and Adesope (2006). The relative utility of a concept map as an instructional tool likely depends on the salience of conceptual relationship semantics communicated by the map. A concept map in which this salience is poor due to poor visual communications design may not be effective for learning relative to other instruction forms. Unfortunately, research on how to design concept maps that enhance learning is still rare (Kriegelstein, 2022; Schroeder et al., 2018). Educational concept map designers lack significant empirically tested guidance regarding how to best do their work. This research project will investigate the design of concept maps, particularly with regard to the representation of conceptual relationship semantics, which can be enhanced for optimal understanding of the information the map communicates. Efforts will be made to improve the designs of large node-link concept maps found in The Core of GIScience 2020 and EO4GEO Body of Knowledge (BoK) sections of the online educational publication The Living Textbook (LTB) (Figures 2, 3), which is managed by the University of Twente, Faculty of Geo-Information Science and Earth Observation (ITC). These concept maps may also be considered knowledge maps, node-link diagrams in which all links represent relationships belonging to a fixed set of relationship types (O'Donnell et. al, 2002). Knowledge maps can be considered a specific type of concept map (Schroeder et. al, 2018). Knowledge maps can be distinguished from their close cousins knowledge graphs by their information visualization primary use case: The primary use case of knowledge graphs lies in data storage (Rhem, 2019). The LTB concept maps visualize relationships existing among a large number of concepts in the geo-information science and earth observation domains (Lemmens et. al, 2018). Each node represents one unique concept. Nodes are connected with directed links, each representing one of several relationship types. These concept maps' current representation of conceptual relationship semantics may be considered poor. A student using the concept maps to learn may have difficulty discriminating different relationships belonging to individual concept-relationship-concept triples: All relationship types are represented with the same link symbology, and, in many locations in the maps, links cross each others' paths. Additionally, the map does not clearly communicate information about conceptual relationship superstructures, to which multiple node-link-node triples may belong. For example, several node-link-node triples in the EO4GEO BoK concept map are relevant to the broad topics of cartography and geovisualization. However, the map's current design doesn't lucidly communicate the close semantic relationships shared among these node-link-node triples. The design improvement work taking place during the thesis research will focus on remedying these representation shortcomings of the maps' conceptual relationship semantics. Suitable design optimizations will be identified following reviews of academic literature regarding cognitive processes involved in learning with node-link concept maps and principles of good information visualization; solicitation of opinions of students and teachers who make use of the concept maps regarding the strengths and weaknesses of their current designs; and an examination of similar large, online node-link concept maps whose designs are considered optimal. Design optimization work will likely draw on information visualization and cartographic theories regarding appropriate use of visual variables and visual hierarchy. The improved designs will then be evaluated during a qualitative user study involving UT-ITC students who use the LTB in their educational and professional pursuits. During the user study, students will likely be asked to complete spatial analysis questions similar to those they are often required to complete during their studies. Effectively answering the questions will require interaction with the redesigned concept maps. The effectiveness of proposed design optimizations for learning will be evaluated with participant observation, think aloud, and questionnaire methods. Proposed design optimizations evaluated to be conducive to learning may be permanently implemented in the concept maps following the completion of the thesis project. Information gained from the thesis research could be used to guide future design optimizations of similar node-link concept maps used for instruction about a variety of subjects, including cartography and beyond.

AB  - Creativity is widely described as a key '21st Century skill'. Science education in schools has emphasized the development of science inquiry and problem-solving skills with the support of technology, and paid insufficient attention to creative thinking skills for producing innovative ideas or solutions. This paper presents an exploratory study aiming to investigate how secondary school students engage in scientific creativity tasks with the support of technology, in particular how they generate ideas in small groups via applying relevant thinking strategies, engaging in social communication, and constructing a computer-based mind map to facilitate group thinking. The participants were 24 Grade 11 students from a high school, who worked on a set of scientific creativity tasks in 6 groups. Epistemic network analysis of group conversations reveals that constructing a mind map helped students to retain ideas for elaboration and evaluation, stimulate new threads of discussion, and regulate task progression. Compared to low-performing groups, high-performing groups engaged more in divergent thinking, mind mapping, and regulative discussions, in addition to making these activities more closely connected with idea generation. These findings have implications for the design of technology-supported educational interventions intended to promote and improve group creativity in science education. • We investigate how students generate ideas together via computer-based mind mapping. • Mind mapping helps retain thoughts, stimulate new ideas, and regulate discussions. • High-performing groups engaged more in thinking, mapping, and regulative discussions. • Mapping, thinking, and idea generation are more connected in productive discourse.

AB  - Molecular biology theory represents a critical scaffold, which underpins multiple disciplines within life sciences education. However, it is well-documented that undergraduate students can struggle to achieve deeper understanding of key concepts and/or their application. One challenging, contributory aspect is the "invisible" nature of molecular biology processes compounded by critical 3D spatial orientations of the principal components and their interactions. Molecular theory specifically requires students to construct accurate, mental spatial models to develop their understanding. However, much of the traditional teaching and examination of such theory is limited to 2D representations. Technology-enhanced, complementary teaching and examination approaches, which engage students with spatial aspects of theoretical concepts, offer an exciting opportunity to support student learning in this area. In this study, we have explored the integration of an immersive virtual reality simulation based on a challenging molecular biology concept within an existing module taught at University College Cork. A mixed methods approach, grounded in learning theory, was undertaken to assess the student user and learning experience. The consensus response from students was one of enhanced learning, understanding, engagement, and motivation. Student partnership in the process of simulation design and integration was key to delivering the fully integrated experience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Popular discourse identifies education as the cure for many of society's ills. However, surviving university is often seen as a period in which students face a unique array of challenges. Many students begin their tertiary education as holistically-well individuals, but due to the stressors related to University, students often show incremental signs of psychological, physical and emotional distress. These often lead to a decrease in academic competence and severe professional ramifications. The aim of this study was to identify design principles and explore the perceptions of professionals concerning possible implementation strategies that could be suitable for Higher Educational Institutions, particularly Health Science and Medical School students. A qualitative, three-phase multiapproach design was used in this study. Phase one was conducted by means of an explorative desktop literature review, there after phase 2 included a self-management, self-coaching and appreciative coaching concept map, that was aligned to concepts within the current individual wellness literature and in phase 3, Appreciative Inquiry based focus group discussions were held with various professional in the field of coaching, education, and healthcare. Wellness programmes are impacted by the fact that Higher Education Institutions face unique challenges such as time, financial constraints, and an already overloaded curriculum. Five design principles were described, and various implementation strategies explored. There is a fundamental necessity to address the distortion of wellness within HE. A key finding in this study suggests that combining self-coaching, appreciative coaching and self-management principles could facilitate a successful individual wellness programme for higher educational students.

AB  - The analysis of the frontier issues of the English language teaching method in China is of great guidance for English language teaching. Based on the ontology model of English teaching domain, the knowledge map of English teaching in colleges and universities is constructed by fusing heterogeneous English subject data from multiple sources. Firstly, we obtain domain knowledge from relevant websites and existing documents through web crawlers and other techniques and clean the data based on BERT model; then, we use Word2Vec to judge the similarity between the research directions of characters and solve the entity alignment problem; based on the scientific knowledge map theory, we count the frequency of keywords in each year and analyze them to describe the association and union between keywords. It can explain the current situation and trend, rise and fall, disciplinary growth points, and breakthroughs of ELT. Through keyword analysis, the hot issues mainly revolve around ELT, English teaching, college English, grammar-translation method, curriculum reform, and so forth, to realize the quick query and resource statistics of ELT basic data, in order to promote the subsequent English discipline assessment work to be completed more efficiently.

AB  - <bold>Introduction: </bold>Menthol cigarettes were banned in Ontario, Canada on January 1st, 2017. We used concept mapping, a mixed-method approach, to describe how menthol cigarette smokers quit smoking after the Ontario menthol ban.<bold>Methods: </bold>Pre-ban daily and non-daily menthol cigarette smokers who reported smoking abstinence 24 months after the ban (n = 62; 53.2% women; mean age = 43.6, SD = 12.5) generated statements describing reasons and strategies for smoking cessation/reduction after the menthol ban. Participants sorted a final list of 57 statements into groups of similar content and rated statements on how true each statement was for them and multidimensional scaling analysis identified thematic clusters.<bold>Results: </bold>Six clusters were identified: Mental and Environment Changes, Direct Ban Impacts, Health Reasons, Cues to Action, Family and Friends, and Cessation Strategies. The highest rated statements (i.e., most true) suggested many participants were motivated to quit smoking before or after the ban and 30.7% of participants believed the menthol ban helped with smoking cessation. Some of the lowest rated statements included using nicotine replacement therapy products, medication (i.e., Champix), or other tobacco products suggesting these strategies were less common. Statement ratings suggested many smokers quit without using replacement products or medication, but modifying cognitions and avoiding smoking cues were common.<bold>Conclusions: </bold>The menthol ban aided some menthol smokers to quit, while others reported the ban did not play a role in smoking cessation. These data suggest the menthol ban had direct and indirect effects on smoking reduction behavior. Campaigns supporting similar bans that target both types of effects will likely be most effective for smoking reduction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students' vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students' vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes.

AB  - Introduction: Vertically integrating physiology into patient care has the potential to improve clinical reasoning. Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is a case-based teaching method that brings together students from all years of medical school to focus on linking clinical presentations to core basic science concepts including anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. In this study, we describe the implementation of CPGR at two different institutions in the United States and assess student-reported outcomes. Methods: We survey students who participated in CPGR at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S) and Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Subjects were queried across three domains: the benefits of attending, the impact of concept maps, and the impact of the mixed-learner environment. Results: Despite differences in session leadership and the underlying medical school curricula, conference attendees reported similar benefits at the two schools included in this study. Students overwhelmingly (92.9%) reported that remembering clinical presentations was easier when they understood the underlying physiology. They also reported gaining a true understanding of concepts that were previously memorized (87.5%). Both clinical (92.5%) and preclinical students (93.1%) valued the mixed-learner environment as a component of the conference. Discussion: By assuring a mixed-learner environment with near-peer interactions, using concept maps as a teaching tool, and rigorously linking clinical presentation and management to physiological concepts, we found that the key benefits of CPGR were replicable across different institutions, despite several local differences in how CPGR was implemented, led, and conducted.

AB  - • The concept of Mapping Functions is introduced. • Enables physics-guided and data-driven derivation of expressions for engineering phenomena. • This approach is verified against three complex engineering problems. This paper presents; mapping functions , a machine learning (ML) and simulation-free approach to enable physics-guided and data-driven derivation of expressions that describe engineering phenomena. In this approach, a series of ML models are first developed to examine a given phenomenon, and insights from their analysis, together with those obtained from physics principles, are then used to identify key features governing the noted phenomenon while satisfying the Law of Parsimony of Occam's Razor. The identified features are subsequently explored via a search space to map the causality of the problem on hand into compact descriptive expressions which can be applied directly to examine such phenomenon, thereby negating the need for subsequent modeling. The proposed approach overcomes some limitations associated with traditional means of arriving at descriptive expressions as examined against structural and fire engineering problems. This approach offers an alternative method that is cognitive, instantaneous, and affordable. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In Trinidad and Tobago, occupational therapy is an emerging profession with limitations in the number of practitioners and the scope of practice. With the development of a new Master of Science Occupational Therapy programme in the country, the profession is continuously growing. There has been an increased demand for culturally relevant research to build the occupational therapy evidence base locally. However, the narrow range of occupational therapy literature in the country makes it difficult to highlight research gaps and decipher what research areas should be prioritised to best impact occupational therapy practice at present. This group concept mapping study is aimed at identifying priority areas for occupational therapy research in Trinidad and Tobago from the perspectives of occupational therapy students and practitioners. Participants brainstormed and contributed specific research ideas they would like to see developed in the country. Individually, participants sorted these ideas into themes and rated each idea based on perceived importance and feasibility. Using the GroupWisdom™ software, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to the sort data to create idea clusters within a concept map. Rating values were analysed to determine priority research themes within the concept map. The resulting concept map illustrated seven research priorities: Contextualising Practitioner Development, The Realities of Emerging OT Practice, Localising Mental Health OT, Occupation and Participation of Children and Youth, School-based OT in the Local Context, OT with Special Populations, and OT Contributions to the Public Health Sector. These findings represent the research needs of the occupational therapy profession in Trinidad and Tobago and will help to focus future researchers' efforts to expand the local evidence base.

AB  - Mapping is a fundamental mathematical concept that is used in many elementary areas of science and mathematics and has numerous applications. The core purpose of this study is to provide a theoretical and analytical approach for carving out a basic structure of composite mappings on the classes of Fuzzy Hypersoft (FHS) sets. It is a comprehensive study of existing concepts regarding mappings on fuzzy soft, soft and hesitant fuzzy soft classes through characterizing of composite mappings on FHS classes. Moreover, certain generalized properties of mappings on FHS classes like FHS images and FHS inverse images, are established. Some related results are verified with the help of illustrative examples.

AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question "Who am I?," was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom.

AB  - Entrustable professional activities (EPAs) provide a novel approach to support teachers' structured professionalization and to assess improvement in teaching competence thereafter. Despite their novelty, it is important to assess EPAs as a construct to ensure that they accurately reflect the work of the targeted profession. The co-creation of an EPA framework for training and entrustment of small-group facilitators has been discussed in the literature. Although a rigorous design process was used to develop the framework, its content validity has not been established yet. Approach: A modified Delphi technique was used. Three survey rounds were conducted from December 2019 to April 2020. Expert health professions educationalists were recruited using purposive sampling and snowball techniques. In Round 1, a rubric consisting of seven items was used to assess the quality of nine pre-designed EPAs. In Round 2, competencies required to perform the agreed-upon EPAs were selected from 12 competencies provided. In Round 3, consensus was sought on sub-activities recommended for agreed-upon EPAs. Quantitative data were analyzed using multiple statistical analyses, including item-wise and rubric-wise content validity indices, asymmetric confidence interval, mean, standard deviation, and response frequencies. Qualitative data were thematically analyzed using content analysis. Three of the nine proposed EPAs achieved statistical consensus for retention. These EPAs were: (1) preparing an activity, (2) facilitating a small-group session, and (3) reflecting upon self and the session. Nine of the 12 pre-determined competencies achieved consensus and were then mapped against each agreed-upon EPA based on their relevance. Finally, results indicated consensus on five, six, and four sub-activities for EPA 1, EPA 2, and EPA 3, respectively. The final framework delineates three EPAs for small-group facilitation and their associated sub-activities. The full description of each EPA provided in this article includes the title, context, task specification, required competencies, and entrustment resources. Program developers, administrative bodies, and teaching staff may find this EPA framework useful to structure faculty development, to entrust teachers, and to support personal development.

AB  - Background: This study aimed to use a concept mapping methodology to develop a European framework of the needs of parents/guardians (P/G) for supporting athletes combining sport and education (dual career, DC). Methods: By means of a concept mapping methodology, 337 French, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, and Slovenian parents sorted and rated 80 potential statements associated to parenting DC athletes. Results: Five distinct clusters emerged: 1. P/G' roles, needs and awareness to support athletes, including 22 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2–4.2 pt); 2. Requirements for effective planning of DC pathway, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2–4.5 pt); 3. Educational opportunity, including 13 statements (mean:3.5; range: 3.1–4.0 pt); 4. Policy and provision for DC, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.1–4.2 pt); and 5. Athletes' lifestyle & self-management, including 7 statements (mean:4.0; range: 3.5–4.5 pt). Estimates of effect size (Partial eta-squared) were calculated for ANOVAs to assess the degree of variability on the statement importance ranking as the dependent variable accounted for by the demographic data. The concept mapping showed good validity (stress value: 0.11) and high reliability (rSHT: 0.99, rSHM: 0.98; rRR:0.98). One-third of the statements indicated differences (p<0.05) in relation to the P/Gs' gender and the athletes' education level, competition level and sport typology. Conclusion: In synthesizing the opinions, experience and needs of P/Gs of DC athletes the present framework provided sound theoretical underpinnings to inform the development of an online educational programme for empowering parenting DC athletes (https://edu.empatiasport.eu/eng/), as well as be a foundation for future Pan-European DC research on how these statements interact with each other, in different European contexts.

AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry‐based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game‐based inquiry‐based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem‐solving performances. Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children's learning motivation and engagement of game‐based inquiry learning activities.Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles.Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming.What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach (ARG‐CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry‐based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums).Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs.ARG‐CMQ improved children's learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs.ARG‐CMQ might limit children's divergent thinking and influences their creative problem‐solving performance.Implications for practice and/or policy ARG‐CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry‐based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher‐order cognitive abilities.ARG‐CMQ can be used to support competency‐based education.

AB  - In order to study and prevent water hazards in coal mines under thick loose strata, we need to make correct assessments of their water abundance levels based on the limited borehole data. According to the multi-source information composite principle, five main influencing factors of water abundance are chosen, and they are: the aquifer thickness, the thickness ratio between sandy and clayey layers, the consumption of the drilling fluid, the core recovery rate, and the hydraulic conductivity. Their spatial variations in the whole study area could be inferred from Kriging interpolation. Next, we have developed a novel off-the-shelf two-step assessment approach. In the first step, we apply a dimensionality reduction technique called Fisher discriminant analysis (FDA) to project the original normalized data into a low-dimensional space, which is convenient for data visualization. In this projection process, we want to keep the original information as much as possible. In the second step, we train three classification algorithms on the same transformed low-dimensional data to predict the water abundance level, and leave-one-out cross-validation is used to validate our proposed method due to data sparsity. Finally, the comprehensive zoning map of the study area's water abundance level is established, which can provide scientific guidance for the mining operations and prevention of mine water hazards in this region. The whole process is further elaborated through a case study of the Baodian coal mine, from which we are able to know the location with the highest water abundance level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There are a number of different research-based teaching methods that instructors can use to improve student learning outcomes. This work examines a modification of peer quizzing that introduces a reflection element. Students take individual quizzes and then are allowed to redo part of the quiz while working with a partner. By allowing the students to choose which problems they will redo, the students must pause and reflect on which concepts (problems) they do and do not feel confident about. The results show that there is a clear benefit to introducing weekly quizzes as measured by the Hake gain score on concept assessment tests. Further, a multivariate least squares regression indicates that a student's gain score can be predicted by their exam mean, quiz mean, and their mean improvement on the quiz redo. Thus, students who score above average on their quiz redos will also show above average concept assessment gains. An analysis of when and how the students are changing their answers demonstrates that students across the spectrum (both high- and low-achieving) benefit from the quiz redo and that all students are engaged in teaching their peers. Finally, we see evidence that it is not single students teaching their peers, but rather that peer instruction is bidirectional and can even result in situations where two wrongs make a right. Overall, these results suggest that interventions aimed at students with low quiz redo scores for their quiz grade may have a significant impact in helping student learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Applying ArcGIS Online application to geological fieldwork provides an alternative way to teach students. This brief report describes an educational innovation for geological fieldwork with the ArcGIS Online application to examine students' learning experiences. In comparison to traditional classrooms, this teaching method enables students to more easily comprehend how geological structures and features connect through the mapping area. This observation indicates that students can think about the structure and deformation events as spatial continuity during acquisition data gathering in the field. Results from independent t-tests between treated and untreated student groups show that the average post-test scores of the treated students were significantly higher than pre-test scores, at a p = 0.05 level, after using ArcGIS Online in fieldwork designed in this study. Therefore, the ArcGIS Online application plays an important role in changing and developing the geological fieldwork in Thailand at the university scale for students. This teaching method could potentially benefit any science teaching and have applications in other disciplines requiring similar skills as well. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are pivotal actors in international affairs. They manage billions of dollars in funding, work all around the world, and shape global policies and standards. It thus comes as no surprise that the subject of accountability has drawn the interest of an increasing number of scholars across disciplines. Though there seems to be agreement about its desirability, accountability is also described as chameleon-like and ambiguous. And despite calls for more cross-disciplinary learning and conceptual clarity, there does not exist a comprehensive review of accountability conceptualizations across and within disciplines, or how the different meanings relate to each other. Based on the conceptual review of 217 research articles published within the last twenty years, this study identifies and analyzes conceptualizations of accountability in the major journals of five engaged disciplines: accounting, development studies, international relations and political science, organization studies and management, and public administration. Integrating this broad scholarship reveals that: (1) there exist 113 different conceptualizations of accountability, 90 of which are rarely used and appear in less than 5 percent of all analyzed articles, (2) scholars have used forty-three different conceptualizations in 2019 compared to seventeen conceptualizations in 2009, (3) many conceptualizations refer to same phenomena by different name (duplication), and different phenomena by the same name (conflict), and that (4) conceptual ambiguity contributes to ambiguity among the forty different terms used to measure and operationalize accountability. These findings illustrate a lack of cross-disciplinary learning and accumulation of knowledge, and suggest that new conceptualizations be introduced only if one or more of the 113 existing ones don't already capture an idea sufficiently. The purpose of this article is to serve as a concept map for scholars when debating and charting new directions for the study of accountability. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose: Substantial government investment has accelerated innovation activity in children's social care in England over the past decade. Ethical concerns emerge when innovation seems to be propelled by a drive for efficiency and over-reliance on process output indicators, as well as, or even instead of, improving the lives of children, families and societies. No ethical framework exists at present to act as a check on such drivers. This paper reviews the literature with the aim of considering how best to address this gap. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on a review of innovation in children's social care, conducted as part of an Economic and Social Research Council-funded project exploring innovation in services for young people exposed to extra-familial risk and harm. Findings: This study proposes a new conception of "trustworthy innovation" for the sector that holds innovation in children's social care to the standards and principles of the code of ethics for social work. This study offers an ethical framework, informed by the interdisciplinary school of organisational ethics, to operationalise this extended definition; the analytic framework guides policymakers and the practice sector to question at every stage of the innovation process whether a particular model is ethically appropriate, as well as practically feasible within a specific context. Implications for local decision-making and national policy are set out, alongside questions raised for future research. Originality/value: This paper is the first to offer an ethical framework for innovation in children's social care. The conception of "trustworthy innovation" offers a guide to policymakers and the practice sector, which they can use to ethically test every stage of the innovation process and make decisions about whether a particular model is ethically appropriate, as well as practically feasible within a specific context.

AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of the concept of "clinical credibility" in nursing science. Background: In both academic and clinical settings, the phrase "clinical credibility" is used when discussing the education of health professionals. No clear definition for the concept is evident in the academic literature. To date, there has not been a study undertaken to develop a working definition of clinical credibility in nursing science. Methods: This protocol is stage 1 of a registered report. We will use concept mapping to compare and organise views of three stakeholder groups: nursing students (n = 20) from years 2 or 3 of a three‐year Bachelor of Nursing Programme, nurses and other health professionals (n = 20) still practising within a clinical setting, and people who have recently been inpatients in hospital (n = 20). First, participants will take part in separate stakeholder focus groups to generate statements about "What is clinical credibility?". Second, the same participants will complete two tasks: (1) rank the importance of each statement (prioritising) and (2) put the statements that appear to go together into groups (clustering). The data will then be analysed using a specialised software program called Ariadne. A visual "concept map" will be produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by the participants. The projected timeline for the study is one year. The paper complies with the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines for study protocols adapted for mixed methods research. Conclusion: The findings of this study will provide a working definition of the concept of "clinical credibility" in nursing science. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings can be used to develop a measure of clinical credibility to predict student satisfaction and patient safety outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of 'clinical credibility' in nursing science. Methods: This is stage 2 of a registered report. Concept mapping methodology, 1. Preparation, 2. Generation of statements (brainstorming), 3. Structuring of statements (prioritising/clustering), 4. Representation of statements, 5. Interpretation of maps and 6. Utilisation of maps were used. Part 1 of our registered report followed the required items on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. Part 2 was reporting the results of our study adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines. Results: Participants (n = 67) from three stakeholder groups participated in this study. Nursing students (n = 23), nurses and other healthcare professionals (n = 23), and patients (within the last 12 months) (n = 21). Participants (n = 62) generated statements (n = 429) in response to the question: 'What does clinical credibility mean to you?'. Following statement reduction, participants (n = 61) prioritised and clustered (n = 80) statements. The data were analysed using the concept mapping software, Ariadne. A visual 'concept map' was produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by all participants. The final concept map had nine clusters. In order of importance these are as follows: 1. Safe practice, 2. Communication, 3. Patient‐centred care, 4. Accountable, 5. Professional practice, 6. Clinical competence, 7. Teaching attributes, 8. Contemporary expert and 9. Leadership. This study was undertaken over an eight‐month period. Conclusion: Clinical credibility is not necessarily about contemporary clinical practice. It is a multidimensional construct of which current clinical practice is one element. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is considered to be an effective teaching and learning strategy as it leads to longer retention of concepts learnt, improves problem-solving skills and enhances critical thinking. However, teachers often find it difficult to implement as they do not receive guidance during their initial training. A professional development intervention lasting four weekends was organised on developing rural science teachers' knowledge and skills in the use of PBL strategies for teaching circuit electricity. The aim of the study was firstly to explore how rural science teachers' knowledge and classroom activity change after the intervention and secondly to establish these teachers' experiences when implementing the strategy in rural schools. Three different instruments, i.e. open-ended questionnaires, interview schedules and a lesson observation protocol, were used to obtain qualitative data from 16 teachers in a total of eight purposively selected schools. The theoretical framework used was the social constructivist theory as it embeds the PBL strategy. Findings indicate that teachers indeed changed their teaching as learners made predictions, formulated hypotheses and were involved in thought-provoking activities. Rural teachers' experiences were similar to previous findings. However, these rural teachers had to additionally deal with the challenge of large classes and a lack of information technology support in the use of a PBL strategy. The divergence of the language of learning and teaching from the learners' home language was not found to be problematic. Not all teachers were qualified but according to the classroom observations they all displayed good content knowledge in circuit electricity, even when using PBL strategies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Flood susceptibility modeling was done using hybrid machine learning approaches. • OneR method was used for feature selection. • Models performance was evaluated using standard statistical measures including AUC-ROC. • Developed models achieved a high flood susceptibility prediction accuracy. • RSSPART was the best machine learning model. Recently, floods are occurring more frequently every year around the world due to increased anthropogenic activities and climate change. There is a need to develop accurate models for flood susceptibility prediction and mapping, which can be helpful in developing more efficient flood management plans. In this study, the Partial Decision Tree (PART) classifier and the AdaBoost, Bagging, Dagging, and Random Subspace ensembles learning techniques were combined to develop novel GIS-based ensemble computational models (ABPART, BPART, DPART and RSSPART) for flood susceptibility mapping in the Quang Binh Province, Vietnam. In total, 351 flood locations were used in the model study. This data was divided into a 70:30 ratio for model training (70% ≅ 255 locations) and (30% ≅ 96 locations) for model validation. Ten flood influencing factors, namely elevation, slope, curvature, flow direction, flow accumulation, river density, distance from river, rainfall, land-use, and geology, were used for the development of models. The OneR feature selection method was used to select and prioritize important factors for the spatial modeling. The results revealed that land-use, geology, and slope are the most important conditioning factors in the occurrence of floods in the study area. Standard statistical methods, including the ROC curve (AUC), were used for the performance evaluation of models. Results indicated that the performance of all models was good (AUC > 0.9) and RSSPART (AUC = 0.959) outperformed the others. Thus, the RSSPART model can be used for accurately predicting and mapping flood susceptibility. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Evaluate efficacy of a year-long local food sourcing promotional campaign on school nutrition programs' (SNP) use of practices. Previous research established the benefit of locally sourced foods including increased dietary quality and support of local economies. Prior research also identified barriers including lack of product availability, knowledge of regulations and personnel time. Convenience sample of 25 Oklahoma SNP administrators/managers. Multiple communication methods were employed during the 2018-2019 academic year to address perceived barriers to local food sourcing by SNPs. Methods included development and use of a fact sheet at 2 statewide SNP management training sessions, culinary chef consults and follow-up emails. Management-level personnel completed hierarchical concept maps before and after the school year assisted by a trained research assistant. Two base questions assessed 1) procurement methods used and food types purchased, and 2) perceived barriers. Secondary data provided school demographic information. At post-assessment, research assistants queried about number of local food sourcing campaign trainings/contacts received. Programs were self-operated (92%) and served grades K-12 (96%). Most were rurally located (60%), with <10,000 student enrollment (96%) and mid to high poverty (96%). There was no difference in local food purchasing by geographical location. At end-of-year, there was a 20% increase in the number of schools purchasing local foods. There was an increase in the number of food types purchased (P = 0.043, Cohen's d = 0.89). There was no difference pre to post in procurement methods used (P = 0.14) or perceived barriers (P = 0.056). The most often reported barrier was lack of product availability. This study demonstrated efficacy of a campaign to increase SNPs' use of local food sourcing. More work based on social-ecological and diffusion of innovation behavior change theories is needed to increase availability of product and address perceived cost/benefits to further expand diffusion of the practices.

AB  - Retrieval practice enhances the learning of educational materials, and prior work has shown that practicing retrieval can enhance learning as much as or more than creating concept maps. Few studies have combined retrieval practice with other learning activities, and no prior work has explored whether concept mapping and retrieval practice might produce especially robust effects when the two activities are combined. In two experiments, students studied educational texts and practiced retrieval (by freely recalling the texts), created concept maps, or completed both activities. In the combined-activity condition, students studied and created concept maps prior to practicing retrieval. On a 1-week delayed assessment, practicing retrieval enhanced learning relative to creating concept maps. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping and retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit over retrieval practice without concept mapping, even though students in the combined condition spent substantially more time engaged with the materials than did students in single-activity conditions. Educational Impact and Implications Statement: Can students benefit even more from retrieval-based learning if they first learn the material by using an elaborative study activity? To investigate this question, students read educationally relevant biology texts and then practiced retrieval by writing down everything they could remember from the text, constructed concept maps, or constructed a concept map before practicing retrieval. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping with retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit beyond retrieval practice alone, calling the alleged learning benefits of concept mapping into question.

AB  - As the Baby Boomer generation reaches old age, there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults needing healthcare over the past decade. The physiology of aging is therefore a highly relevant topic for the preclinical medical curriculum. I describe a new capstone unit on the physiology of aging, placed at the end a medical physiology course, to provide a vehicle for integration of prior learning about physiology of each individual body system. Students were provided with online selfstudy modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a "Review of Systems" predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The motivation for the design of this study was to understand the possibility and impact of the involvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals on school STEM education. This involved two stages, with the design of a set of authentic STEM inquiry activities firstly and implementation in primary classrooms secondly. Five teachers from a local primary school, who were making their first attempt in implementing STEM learning with students at senior primary levels, participated in this study. The teachers worked collaboratively with an Environmental Scientist with support from the research team to design authentic STEM activities to solve a problem which is currently affecting the school environment. The study used a qualitative approach with teachers' pre- and post- concept maps, self-reflections and interviews to capture changes in teachers' STEM conceptions. The findings showed that "School-STEM Professionals' Collaboration" had a positive impact on teachers' conceptions of STEM education and STEM professionals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Critical thinking is embedded in 2 dimensions, critical attitude and ability, which may or may not mutually affect students' self-confidence in science inquiry learning. To understand this issue, we designed a website called Enriched Thinking Cloud based on the predict-observe-explain (POE) model of inquiry-based learning by providing themes for students to learn about moon science concepts. Moreover, we calculated their critical performance based on object identification theory. Data collected from 163 participants were subjected to confirmatory factor analysis with structural equation modeling to test the prediction among paths of the research model. The results showed that attitude toward POE online inquiry learning can positively predict participants' self-confidence in using Enriched Thinking Cloud (hereafter "self-confidence") and can also predict their critical attitude. Furthermore, self-confidence and critical attitude can positively predict their cognitive dimension of the critical thinking process. The results suggest that science teachers can design more POE inquiry models to enhance students' critical ability and attitude in earth science learning. • The cognitive dimension of critical thinking and students' attitudes towards online science inquiry learning are evaluated. • Attitude towards POE online learning was positively correlated to self-confidence and critical attitude. • Critical attitude was positively correlated to self-confidence and the cognitive dimension of critical thinking progress. • Self-confidence was positively correlated to the cognitive dimension of critical thinking progress.

AB  - Recently an increasing focus has been observed on the learner-centred approaches for their role in preparing more independent and skilful graduates. Of these active learning styles, self-regulated learning has received greater attention in higher education. In this context, it is highly important to examine current state of self-regulated learning adopted by students, along with examining the gender differences and the nature of discipline in adopting self-regulated learning. Considering this situation, the prime objective of the study was to map the link between students' self-regulated learning and their academic achievement in their related disciplines, and on basis of their gender. Using the descriptive design, a quantitative survey was used to collect the data from 300 students of two public sector universities of Pakistan. A questionnaire was adopted to collect data from students to measure their level of adopted self-regulated learning and CGPA. Simple linear regression and t-test and ANOVA were applied to reach to certain results. Our findings rejected the main hypothesis that there is no impact of self-regulated learning on students' academic achievement. Likewise, this study could not identify the difference in view of adopting self-regulated learning strategies by male and female students at higher education. However, in view of measuring SRL at faculty level, students from the faculty of science adopted self-regulated learning strategies to some extent. Next to concrete discussion in relation to these findings limitations and directions for future researches were stressed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Giving and receiving peer feedback is seen as an important vehicle for deep learning. Defining assessment criteria is a first step in giving feedback to peers and can play an important role in feedback providers' learning. However, there is no consensus about whether it is better to ask students to think about assessment criteria themselves or to provide them with ready-made assessment criteria. The current experimental study aims at answering this question in a secondary school STEM educational context, during a physics lesson in an online inquiry learning environment. As a part of their lesson, participants (n = 93) had to give feedback on two concept maps, and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions—being provided or not being provided with assessment criteria. Students' post-test scores, the quality of feedback given, and the quality of students' own concept maps were analyzed to determine if there was an effect of condition on feedback providers' learning. Results did not reveal an advantage of one condition over the other in terms of learning gains. Possible implications for practice and directions for further research are discussed.

AB  - Today, science educators accept that digital literacy has been one of the key concepts for science teachers in terms of creating meaningful science learning environments. Although there are many research attempts investigating digital literacy in science teacher education literature, the interrelations of this concept to cognitive and metacognitive aspects are still blurred. In this regard, this study was conducted to investigate the structural relations among preservice science teachers' epistemological beliefs, self-regulated learning skills, and digital literacy as well as the reasons for these relations. A sequential explanatory research design guided this two-step study. The first step involved structural equation modeling analysis of data from 612 preservice science teachers. The second step focused on the reasons for the structural relations observed in the first step. Six participants were selected as the cases in the latter. Overall, the results showed that participants' epistemological beliefs, self-regulation skills, and digital literacy are closely related to each other. Epistemological and self-regulational filters as well as epistemic bias and the context in which the filters exist directly affect these relationships. Considering the results, it was suggested that preservice science teachers should be involved in inquiry-based and argumentation-based learning mediums since these types of mediums contribute positively to the development of epistemological beliefs and self-regulation skills.

AB  - Analogies, broadly defined, map novel concepts onto familiar concepts, making them essential for perception, reasoning, and communication. We argue that analogy-building served a critical role in the evolution of cumulative culture by allowing humans to learn and transmit complex behavioural sequences that would otherwise be too cognitively demanding or opaque to acquire. The emergence of a protolanguage consisting of simple labels would have provided early humans with the cognitive tools to build explicit analogies and to communicate them to others. This focus on analogy-building can shed new light on the coevolution of cognition and culture and addresses recent calls for better integration of the field of cultural evolution with cognitive science. Analogies map novel concepts onto familiar concepts, aiding the learning and transmission of novel information. Analogies have been studied in cognitive science for years; here we connect this literature with the theory of cultural evolution. Cultural evolution provides a framework for understanding how human culture changes over time, but has been criticised for a lack of emphasis on the cognitive and communicative mechanisms that support cultural transmission. We suggest that a simple protolanguage consisting of labels would have catalysed cumulative cultural evolution by allowing analogy-building to proliferate. Labelling a novel object or action in relation to a familiar one would be particularly helpful for the transmission of cognitively opaque sequences, on which much of human cumulative culture relies.

AB  - Developing students' ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students' recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students' thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students' representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>One of the main elements of patient-centered care is an enhancement of patient preparedness. Thus, pre-visit planning assessment tools was emerged to prepare and involve patients in their treatment process.<bold>Objective: </bold>The main objective of this article was to review the applied tools and techniques for consideration of putting pre-visit planning into practice.<bold>Methods: </bold>Web of Science, Scopus, IEEE, and PubMed databases were searched using keywords from January 2001 to November 2020. The review was completed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Then, qualitative analysis was done to suggest an appropriate framework by mapping the main concepts.<bold>Results: </bold>Out of 385 citations were retrieved in initial database searches, 49 studies from ten countries were included. Applied pre-visit techniques can be classified into eight categories. Our results showed that almost 81% of studies were related to procedures that were done between each visit, while 42% of articles were related to before visits. Accordingly, the main approach of included articles was patient preparedness. While 38 studies reported this approach is effective, three studies reported the effectiveness of such tools as moderate, only two articles believed it had a low effect on improving patient-centered care.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>This survey summarized the characteristics of published studies on pre-visit planning in the proposed framework. This approach could enhance the quality of patient care alongside enhancement patient-provider communication. However, such an approach can also be helpful to control pandemic diseases by reducing unnecessary referrals. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

This efficient model has gained attention as a means to improve the relevance of science training at the undergraduate level. However, while many curricular resources exist, few pedagogical tools are available to support students' development of how their own research fits into that of the scientific community. Adding to these challenges, recent increases in remote instruction demand resources for online learning environments suitable for advanced research‐based laboratory courses. Concept mapping is a method of graphically representing relationships, such as the complex molecular interactions that are studied in many CUREs offered in the biological sciences. Incorporating a concept mapping exercise using an online platform in an upper division molecular biology CURE improved students' senses of collaboration and understanding of their research project and increased the availability of productive collaborative research efforts in a remote format. Quantitative assessment of student's manuscript‐style research reports revealed improvements in students' scientific writing with respect to recognition of the biological complexity of the overarching project to which students' data contribute. Two different levels of implementation with different degrees of interaction with the concept map yielded similar outcomes, suggesting that basic interactions with a concept map make a valuable contribution to help students enrolled in CUREs view their data as part of a larger body of work.

AB  - L5299 --> We are building a prototype of an intelligent textbook which is game‐based and designed for mobile platforms. Our intelligent textbook, Cardiovascular and Respiratory Anatomy Map (CRAM), includes the basic material on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems as well as interactive methods to scaffold the learner's acquisition of higher‐level cognitive skills. The platform is underpinned by hierarchical causal concept maps, diagrams which make explicit the causal and hierarchical relationships between the processes of the biological systems. This architecture provides three clusters of benefits. Gamification itself has the potential to increase not only time‐on‐task but quality of engagement, while the introduction of concepts at the scale of minigames, smaller or simpler games incorporated within a larger framework, maintains novelty by chunking the material. Next, mobile platforms enjoy wide availability and student acceptance while providing opportunities for increasingly multimodal content, including rich, tactile input. Finally, utilizing hierarchical causal concept maps ensures novel content for the student and combats well‐known issues such as shallow learning. Students are invited to explore the interaction between the cardiovascular and respiratory systems through short animations with narrative structures centered around key concepts. Breaking up this presentation of information are minigames which provide tasks related to the scenarios. Following the completion of a game, animations reinforce the chain of events within the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. For example, the learner is prompted with the following scenario: "Mr. B has an arrhythmia with an irregular heart rate." Instructions are shown on how to engage with the minigame, in this case, "Tap the heart on the beat." A heart appears in the center of the screen followed by a line from an electrocardiogram which approaches the heart from the left. The QRS complex occurs in the center of the heart. The learner taps the heart as this occurs. The line then exits from the right side of the heart and reappears on the left. The loop continues until the learner correctly taps the heart a specified number of times. A congratulatory message appears indicating that "Mr. B is feeling better," and an animation plays depicting cardiac output returning to normal, proper blood circulation in the lungs resuming, and the arterial system fulfilling the oxygen demand requirement of the body. Human gross anatomy students face domain‐specific but generational challenges. Cell phone usage among young people has been found to correlate positively with inattention and negatively with academic achievement. Similar to variable ratio reinforcement schedules in gambling, internet‐based technology provides easy rewards with little effort. In comparison, academic activities like reading and lecture appear increasingly unattractive and cognitively strenuous. CRAM attempts to address these challenges. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - R3318 --> Background: Regulation of blood pressure (BP) is one of many physiological endpoints regulated by a nexus of autoregulatory, neural and hormonal mechanisms. BP is directly dependent on cardiac output (CO), vascular peripheral resistance (VPR), and blood volume (BV), but can be altered by a network of neural, hormonal and cellular mechanisms that directly or indirectly modulate any one of the three primary determinants. Students have difficulty comprehending this expansive mechanistic network with diverting and intersecting effects, e.g., the renin‐angiotensin‐aldosterone system that modulates both VPR and BV. Digital learning resources are valuable tools, but can be expensive, require reliable internet connection, and may not be used on exams. Objective: To develop a non‐virtual portable tool for learning the regulatory network for BP that was 1) crafted by the student from inexpensive materials, 2) easily modified and expanded to incorporate various mechanisms as introduced in lecture, and 3) readily constructed and dismantled for self‐testing and easy transport. Approach: A portable and revisable concept map was developed over several semesters with multiple student groups. In preparing for the cardiovascular (CV) section, a list of all components in the regulatory network for BP was made with BP, CO, VPR and BV as the first terms. The CV section began with fundamental descriptions of the closed circulatory system comprised of the heart, vessels and blood and the essentiality of regulating BP to ensure blood flow sufficiently matches metabolic needs of tissues. Students were shown the entire regulatory network on one slide and assured that during the CV section they would learn how all components work together and be able to recreate the network themselves and ultimately, use it as a study aid. To get them started, students received the list of CV terms and several small pieces of paper, e.g., 2"x2" plain paper squares, 3"x5" cards cut in half, standard Post‐It® notes. The instructor explained that when they learned a new mechanism they were to write the term on one side of the paper and the definition and pertinent information on the other in pencil for easier editing. Then the instructor arranged her own set of BP, CO, BV, VPR and other terms on a white board to show the map of functional relationships take shape. As new concepts were discussed, e.g., CO = Stroke Volume (SV) x Heart Rate (HR), the respective terms were added to the map to reflect the physiological relationships. She explained their map could be laid out a table, floor, etc. While studying alone or with study partners, students were encouraged to audibly define terms and relationships among mechanisms as they constructed their maps. They were encouraged to shuffle terms and recreate subsections of the network to understand mechanistic connections at different points in the network. Effectiveness of the tool: Students expressed that manually arranging components helped them better comprehend functional and consequential relationships among different mechanisms. The tool can be used to also learn other regulatory networks, such as those of the digestive system and calcium homeostasis. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is nowadays a constant flux of data being generated and collected in all types of real world systems. These data sets are often indexed by time, space, or both requiring appropriate approaches to analyze the data. In univariate settings, time series analysis is a mature field. However, in multivariate contexts, time series analysis still presents many limitations. In order to address these issues, the last decade has brought approaches based on network science. These methods involve transforming an initial time series data set into one or more networks, which can be analyzed in depth to provide insight into the original time series. This review provides a comprehensive overview of existing mapping methods for transforming time series into networks for a wide audience of researchers and practitioners in machine learning, data mining, and time series. Our main contribution is a structured review of existing methodologies, identifying their main characteristics, and their differences. We describe the main conceptual approaches, provide authoritative references and give insight into their advantages and limitations in a unified way and language. We first describe the case of univariate time series, which can be mapped to single layer networks, and we divide the current mappings based on the underlying concept: visibility, transition, and proximity. We then proceed with multivariate time series discussing both single layer and multiple layer approaches. Although still very recent, this research area has much potential and with this survey we intend to pave the way for future research on the topic.

AB  - This study investigated the extent to which the proposed Factory of Ideas (FOI) teaching approach impacted on students' understanding of energy based on their prior knowledge. The FOI is a didactic approach that, unlike the classic cognitive conflict approach, employs a variety of activities to offer students a scientific conception for comparison with their own, and to expose students to several contexts in which the concept is applied. A total of 122 Grade 8 students participated in the study. A quasi-experimental research design with both a pre–post-test and a control and experimental group was employed. The control group (an intact class, N = 58) was taught using traditional teaching methods while the experimental group (an intact class, N = 64) was taught using the FOI teaching approach, which is underpinned by tenets of argumentation theory. The content-based pre- and post-test produced quantitative data that were analysed using SPSS. Based on the t-test comparing the mean scores of the two groups after the intervention, the experimental group was consistently found to outperform the control group on the correct understanding of energy concepts. Thus the FOI teaching approach impacted significantly on students' understanding of energy concepts. However, for some students, the FOI did not significantly change the students' use of alternative conceptions related to the law of conservation of energy. It is concluded that the FOI strategy is in general an effective teaching strategy, with the potential to facilitate learning of new scientific concepts, particularly if supported by a number of relevant science applications, and by laboratory and visual resources.

AB  - Recently, scholars have noted how several "old-school" practices—a host of long-standing scientific norms—in combination, sometimes compromise the credibility of research. In response, other scholarly fields have developed several "open-science" norms and practices to address these credibility issues. Against this backdrop, this special issue explores the extent to which and how these norms should be adopted and adapted for educational psychology and education more broadly. Our introductory article contextualizes the special issue's goals by overviewing the historical context that led to open science norms (particularly in medicine and psychology); providing a conceptual map to illustrate the interrelationships between various old-school as well as open-science practices; and then describing educational psychologists' opportunity to benefit from and contribute to the translation of these norms to novel research contexts. We conclude by previewing the articles in the special issue. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We aimed to contribute to a shift in higher education teaching and learning methods by considering problem-based learning (PBL) as an approach capable of positively affecting students from a geology and environment (GE) curricular unit. In a convenience sample from a Portuguese public university, two groups of students were defined: (1) an experimental group (n = 16), to which an intervention program (IP) based on PBL was applied, and (2) a comparison group (n = 17), subjected to the traditional teaching approach. For nine weeks, students subject to the IP faced four problem scenarios about different themes. A triangulation of methods was chosen. The study involved two phases: (1) qualitative (sustained on content analysis of driving questions raised by students, registered in a monitoring sheet) and (2) quantitative (quasi-experimental study, based on data from a prior and post-test knowledge assessment). The qualitative results point to the development of more complex cognitive-level questioning skills after increasing familiarity with PBL. The data obtained in the quantitative study, which included both a "within-subjects" and a "between-subjects" design, show higher benefits in the experimental group, documenting gains in terms of scientific knowledge when using the PBL methodology.

AB  - Introduction: Medical Council of India (MCI) in the current competency based on the undergraduate curriculum for the Indian medical graduate has focussed on the development of critical thinking, reasoning and communicating abilities of the undergraduate students. This would enable them to apply their knowledge effectively and provide better patient care. In this context, concept mapping has proved to be a simple yet powerful tool. Aim: To assess the feasibility of implementing concept mapping module and perception of the students and faculty about use of concept mapping as complementary teaching aid in pharmacology using peer validated questionnaires and Focus Group Discussion (FGD). Materials and Methods: This cross-sectional interventional study was conducted in the Department of Pharmacology of a tertiary hospital in Eastern India. Study duration was six months, from September 2019 to February 2020. After obtaining permission from Institutional Ethics Committee (IEC), 64 consenting students of 2nd professional MBBS, Dean of student affairs, Medical Education Unit (MEU) Co-ordinator and 10 faculties of the Department of Pharmacology were sensitised about the concept mapping. A module for implementation and assessment rubric was decided. Participating students were randomly divided into eight groups (Group A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H), each group comprising eight students. Each group had to prepare one concept map on an allotted topic from General Pharmacology. They had to submit the maps within seven days. Students could use pen and paper or they could utilise computer software to prepare the maps. After submission, faculties other than the researcher assessed and gave feedback to the students. After one month, the second set of assignments was allotted on topics from autonomic nervous system. As before, submission had to be done in seven days. This set was also assessed and feedback given. At the end of second submission, perception of the students and faculties about implementation of the module was assessed through peer validated open as well as closed ended questionnaires. A FGD was also held among participating faculties. Open ended questions were analysed using verbatim and closed ended questions were analysed as percentage using Microsoft Excel. FGD was analysed using content analysis method. Results: Among the 64 participating students, 63 (98.43%) preferred concept mapping as complementary teaching tool in addition to traditional tutorial format and 62 (96.9%) students enjoyed making the concept maps. On analysis of students' feedback, 56 (87.5%) students opined that this module could be included in Pharmacology curriculum. Out of 12 faculties, 7 (58.33%) graded feasibility of the module as 4 out of a maximum of 5. Conclusion: This study concludes that with proper selection of topics, concept mapping may be included as complementary teaching learning tool in Pharmacology curriculum for undergraduate students.

AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step‐by‐step hints when conducting problem‐posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy‐five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP‐FL), students in Group B used the problem‐posing strategy‐based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP‐FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Flipped learning enabled teachers to have more class time to engage students in applying knowledge.Scholars have suggested that the value of flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinkingProblem‐posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking. What this paper adds: This study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning.A flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school.It was also found that the results showed that the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy was effective in terms of improving students' flipped learning performance, especially for those with higher levels of critical thinking tendency. Implications for practice and/or policy: Employing concept maps as a guidance for problem posing is a promising approach.It is worth investigating the impacts of the concept map‐guided problem posing approach on the students with different personal characteristics, such as knowledge levels or motivational levels.It is worth applying the approach to other courses in the future to further explore its effectiveness.

AB  - This paper presents a digital learning tool, MESTRAL ("Modélisation Et Simulation des TRansformations ALimentaires", "Modelling and Simulating Food Processing" in English), that can provide educators with a tool to teach food processing using simulators and a broad range of models derived from research in food science & engineering. It was built using electronic knowledge books (eK-book). The eK-book represents knowledge in the form of concept maps and knowledge sheets, connected via a network of hypertext links. MESTRAL encompasses 15 modules, that cover approximately 150 h of teaching and a broad range of real systems, from a single unit operation (e.g., frying a banana) to a logistic chain (e.g., ham cold chain). Each module conveys information on a food product or a food process, and includes a simulator based on a published scientific model. Altogether, the models address various scale of systems and are based on different theoretical frameworks. For each simulator, the model inputs and outputs are stored in a database. Outputs are visualized through abacuses, which can be used for virtual practice. MESTRAL modules also include training exercises and tests to help students to assess the knowledge they have acquired during consultation of the modules. Finally, MESTRAL has already been successfully tested by different audiences according to various learning forms. • A digital learning tool, Mestral, was built to train people in food processes. • Knowledge is presented in an electronic book with concept maps. • Mestral covers 15 real (food and process) systems and is based on published models. • Each module contains a simulator which represents graphically the model results. • Mestral has been tested satisfactorily and opens up prospects for blended learning.

AB  - The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy.

AB  - Deep learning models have the potential to advance the short-term decision-making of electricity market participants and system operators by capturing the complex dependences and uncertainties of power system operation. Currently, however, the adoption of global deep learning models for multivariate energy forecasting in power systems is far behind the developments in the deep learning research field. In this context, the objectives of this study are to review recent developments in the field of probabilistic, multivariate, and multihorizon time series forecasting and empirically evaluate the performance of novel global deep learning models for forecasting wind and solar generation, electricity load, and wholesale electricity price for intraday and day-ahead time horizons. Two forecast types, deterministic and probabilistic forecasts, are studied. The evaluation data consist of real-world datasets with hourly resolution at the levels of an individual customer and regional and national electricity market bidding zones. The model evaluation criteria include achievable levels of forecasting accuracy and uncertainty risks, hyperparameter sensitivity, the effect of exogenous variables and fieldwise dataset split, and run-time efficiency factors, such as memory utilization, simulation time, electricity consumption, and convergence rate. We conclude that the performance of the global models is more beneficial for intraday forecasts of heterogeneous datasets with nonuniform patterns of time series, but can be affected by the hyperparameter sensitivity and hardware limitations with the growth of dataset dimensionality. The results can serve as a reference point for the quantitative evaluation of deep learning models for probabilistic multivariate energy forecasting in power systems. • Assessment of short-term deterministic and probabilistic energy forecasts. • Real-world datasets with electricity load and price, and wind and solar time series. • Model evaluation for memory, time, electricity consumption, and convergence rate. • Effects of exogenous variables and fieldwise dataset splitting on forecast quality. • Model performance dependence on dataset heterogeneity, hyperparameters, and hardware.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study with the intention of answering the question: can an intentionally structured online environment stimulate and enhance the processes of mutual interaction and hybridization between digital artefacts and analogic artefacts (books) so as to encourage the development of significant learning in students? This research, carried out in the academic year 2018/2019, involved 183 Italian students enrolled on the bachelor's degree in Primary Education Sciences at the University of Salerno attending the course "School experimentation and educational planning". The data were collected by working out and using an information retrieval questionnaire and four different tests. The virtual interaction space was e-LENA, the Learning Management System of the RIMEDI@ research lab. The experimental results highlight how this methodology, called DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) by the authors, has had effects in terms of reducing study time and improving learning outcomes. The online learning environment stimulated to study in greater detail with a book, with the learner being able to restructure and systematize his own knowledge. The DMRA valorises the active role of the learner during his process of knowledge construction and may have significant implications for educators who would like to use innovative and effective online learning environments to enhance student learning. • This paper presents the synergistic use of Dynamic Concept Maps (DCMs) in online learning environments. • DCMs are able to stimulate in students the processes of mutual remediation between digital artefacts and books. • DCMs encourage the development of significant learning. • DCMs favour a more efficient organization of learning in terms of reducing study time. • DCMs are effective in terms of learning outcomes.

AB  - Fatigue is a disabling and prevalent feature of many long-term conditions. Orthostatic dizziness is a commonly experienced by those with fatigue. The purpose was; to evaluate factors contributing to successful delivery of a novel group exercise program designed for people with chronic fatigue and orthostatic symptoms and identify targets to improve future program content and delivery. We used group concept mapping methodology. Participants of the exercise program with a long-term physical health condition and chronic fatigue- contributed ideas in response to a focus question. They sorted these ideas into themed piles and rated them for importance and success of the program delivery. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were applied to the sort data to produce ideas clusters within a concept map. Value ratings were compared to evaluate the success of the program. The resulting concept map depicted seven key themed clusters of ideas: Exercises, Group atmosphere, Physical benefits, Self-management of symptoms, Acceptance and Education. Value plots of the rating data identified important and successful conceptual ideas. The concept maps have depicted key concepts relating to the successful delivery of a novel exercise program for people with fatigue and identified specific targets for future program enhancements. Orthostatic symptoms are common in those with fatigue and might be a target for group-based exercise programs. People with fatigue value a group-based exercise program that targets orthostatic symptoms. The key concepts of a group-based exercise program valued by those with fatigue are the exercises, group atmosphere, physical benefits, self-management support, acceptance, education and support with looking forwards following the program.

AB  - In the face of strikingly intense technological development, there have been significant discrepancies in the understanding of the concept of the map; an understanding that is fundamental to cartography and, more broadly, GIScience. The development of electronic products based on geoinformation has caused a growing need for the systematization of basic concepts, including defining what a map is. In particular, the modification of the idea of the map may profoundly influence the future development of cartography. The comprehensive and innovative use of maps, for example, in location-based service (LBS) applications, may contribute to more in-depth analyses in this area. This article examines how the concept of how the map is used in technological or scientific literature about the latest geoinformation applications, as well as analyzing the survey results that confirm the change in social perception of the concept of the map in cartography. The article also refers to the role of the map in the process of indirect cognition and understanding of geographical space—cognition realized through maps. A social understanding of mapping concepts is evolving and covers the entire spectrum of geoinformation products. It seems that the latest geoinformation solutions, such as navigation applications and, in particular, applications supporting the movement of autonomous vehicles (e.g., self-driving cars), have had a particular impact on the concept of the map. This is confirmed by the results of a survey conducted by the authors on a group of nearly 900 respondents from a variety of countries. The vast majority of users are convinced that the contemporary understanding of the concept of the map is a long way from the classic definition of this concept. Therefore, in the opinion of the authors of this article, it is worth undertaking research that will become a starting point for a discussion about the broader definition of the map in GIScience.

AB  - This paper presents a digital learning tool, MESTRAL ("Modélisation Et Simulation des TRansformations ALimentaires", "Modelling and Simulating Food Processing" in English), that can provide educators with a tool to teach food processing using simulators and a broad range of models derived from research in food science & engineering. It was built using electronic knowledge books (eK-book). The eK-book represents knowledge in the form of concept maps and knowledge sheets, connected via a network of hypertext links. MESTRAL encompasses 15 modules, that cover approximately 150 h of teaching and a broad range of real systems, from a single unit operation (e.g., frying a banana) to a logistic chain (e.g., ham cold chain). Each module conveys information on a food product or a food process, and includes a simulator based on a published scientific model. Altogether, the models address various scale of systems and are based on different theoretical frameworks. For each simulator, the model inputs and outputs are stored in a database. Outputs are visualized through abacuses, which can be used for virtual practice. MESTRAL modules also include training exercises and tests to help students to assess the knowledge they have acquired during consultation of the modules. Finally, MESTRAL has already been successfully tested by different audiences according to various learning forms. • A digital learning tool, Mestral, was built to train people in food processes. • Knowledge is presented in an electronic book with concept maps. • Mestral covers 15 real (food and process) systems and is based on published models. • Each module contains a simulator which represents graphically the model results. • Mestral has been tested satisfactorily and opens up prospects for blended learning.

AB  - • Feedback providers learn more from commenting than from grading peer's work. • Low prior knowledge students may benefit the most from commenting. • The quality of students' own concept maps predicts their post-test scores. In peer assessment, both receiving feedback and giving feedback (reviewing peers' products) have been found to be beneficial for learning. However, the different ways to give feedback and their influence on learning have not been studied enough. This experimental study compared giving feedback by writing comments and by grading, to determine which contributes more to the feedback providers' learning. Secondary school students from Russia (n = 51) and the Netherlands (n = 42) gave feedback on concept maps during a physics lesson. The lesson was given in an online inquiry learning environment that included an online lab. Students gave feedback in a special Peer Assessment tool, which also provided assessment criteria. Findings indicate that post-test knowledge scores were higher for students from the commenting group. The difference between the groups was largest for the low prior knowledge students. Possible educational implications and directions for further research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over 40 years of research, concept maps have shown that they are beneficial for learning. However, much of this research has been conducted in laboratory settings. Although there are a few studies conducted in the classroom, there is little understanding of the instructional efficacy of using different types of concept maps. In a between-subjects design, the present study investigates the effects of learning chemistry in a large undergraduate classroom with three concept mapping activities: static, fill-in-concepts, and fill-in-labels. Students reviewed a static map or completed a fill-in-the-blank concept map. Results show that students studying static concept maps outperformed those who engaged with the fill-in-the-blank concept maps. Further, prior knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of learning performance. Additional findings show that the accuracy of completing partial concept maps mediates the influence of concept map format on learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is widespread evidence showing that concept maps are effective for learning. However, little is known about the effects of various concept map activities. We conducted an experiment to examine the comparative effectiveness of three concept map activities: (i) translating a complete map to a paragraph format, (ii) filling in concepts in a partial map, and (iii) filling in labels in a partial map. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general chemistry course were randomly assigned to the three groups. Each concept map depicted the relationships between concepts on the topic of reaction enthalpy. Results showed that the map-translation group significantly outperformed the fill-in-concepts and fill-in-labels groups in conceptual understanding indicated by open-ended questions while there were no significant differences among the three groups in conceptual understanding indicated by multiple-choice questions.

AB  - Introduction: Accurate clinical decision‐making of dentists should be based on their knowledge and experience. In the past 10 years, interest in competency‐based dentistry education has rapidly increased, but there has been little attention paid to methods of improving dental education competency. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical presentation education model that provides opportunities for students to practice problem‐solving from the moment they greet the patient so that students can obtain the practical experience of competency‐based education and the effectiveness of this model can be confirmed through pilot test. Methods: This article is divided two parts: First, developing the clinical presentation dental education model (CPDEM) and Second, a pilot study adopted CPDEM. To confirm the effectiveness of this model, the students' satisfaction, their perception of self‐achievement were analysed. Results: Clinical presentation dental education model has been developed to provide practice‐related education experience and provide linkage between basic science and clinical science. The result of applying this education model to 10 students as a pilot test was shown an overall high satisfaction level. In addition, self‐achievement students' reported of all intended competencies was higher than for non‐participating students of this model. Conclusions: This study focuses on practical education centring on clinical presentation. This model could get a meaningful and realistic experiences through the practice using clinical presentation of patients, use their metacognition for organizing and memorizing the patient's case by using concept map. It can be used as a future instructional method to enhance students' competency. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Despite an increasing academic attention towards both gamification and competencies-based education, little is known about Higher Education teachers' beliefs regarding the use of gamification to develop students' competencies. To fill this research gap, concept mapping was used to cluster teachers' beliefs in 4 dimensions regarding the use of gamification to develop students' competencies. Our findings suggest that teachers believe that gamification encourages team working and oral communication skills. Moreover, critical thinking and social skills development were also found as some of the benefits that teachers believe the use of gamification can provide to the development of students' competencies. These findings should encourage both Higher Education teachers and policy makers to increase the use of gamification-based programmes to develop students' competencies. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Formation of stimulus equivalence classes has been recently modeled through equivalence projective simulation (EPS), a modified version of a projective simulation (PS) learning agent. PS is endowed with an episodic memory that resembles the internal representation in the brain and the concept of cognitive maps. PS flexibility and interpretability enable the EPS model and, consequently the model we explore in this letter, to simulate a broad range of behaviors in matching-to-sample experiments. The episodic memory, the basis for agent decision making, is formed during the training phase. Derived relations in the EPS model that are not trained directly but can be established via the network's connections are computed on demand during the test phase trials by likelihood reasoning. In this letter, we investigate the formation of derived relations in the EPS model using network enhancement (NE), an iterative diffusion process, that yields an offline approach to the agent decision making at the testing phase. The NE process is applied after the training phase to denoise the memory network so that derived relations are formed in the memory network and retrieved during the testing phase. During the NE phase, indirect relations are enhanced, and the structure of episodic memory changes. This approach can also be interpreted as the agent's replay after the training phase, which is in line with recent findings in behavioral and neuroscience studies. In comparison with EPS, our model is able to model the formation of derived relations and other features such as the nodal effect in a more intrinsic manner. Decision making in the test phase is not an ad hoc computational method, but rather a retrieval and update process of the cached relations from the memory network based on the test trial. In order to study the role of parameters on agent performance, the proposed model is simulated and the results discussed through various experimental settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Ethical issues arise daily in the delivery of palliative care. Despite much (largely theoretical) literature, evidence from specialist palliative care practitioners about day-to-day ethical challenges has not previously been synthesised. This evidence is crucial to inform education and adequately support staff. Aim: To synthesise the evidence regarding the ethical challenges which specialist palliative care practitioners encounter during clinical practice. Design: Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO registration CRD42018105365). Quality was dual-assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Tabulation, textural description, concept mapping and thematic synthesis were used to develop and present the narrative. Data sources: Seven databases (MEDLINE, Philosopher's Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched from inception to December 2019 without language limits. Eligible papers reported original research using inductive methods to describe practitioner-reported ethical challenges. Results: A total of 8074 records were screened. Thirteen studies from nine countries were included. Challenges were organised into six themes: application of ethical principles; delivering clinical care; working with families; engaging with institutional structures and values; navigating societal values and expectations; philosophy of palliative care. Challenges related to specific scenarios/contexts rather than the application of general ethical principles, and occurred at all levels (bedside, institution, society, policy). Conclusion: Palliative care practitioners encounter a broad range of contextual ethical challenges, many of which are not represented in palliative care ethics training resources, for example, navigating institutional policies, resource allocation and inter-professional conflict. Findings have implications for supporting ethical practice and training practitioners. The lack of low- and middle- income country data needs addressing. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Knowledge about forest road networks is essential for sustainable forest management and fire management. The aim of this study was to assess the accuracy of a new hierarchical-hybrid classification tool (HyClass) for mapping paved and unpaved forest roads with LiDAR data. Bare-earth and low-lying vegetation were also identified. For this purpose, a rural landscape (area 70 ha) in northwestern Spain was selected for study, and a road network map was extracted from the cadastral maps as the ground truth data. The HyClass tool is based on a decision tree which integrates segmentation processes at local scale with decision rules. The proposed approach yielded an overall accuracy (OA) of 96.5%, with a confidence interval (CI) of 94.0–97.6%, representing an improvement over pixel-based classification (OA = 87.0%, CI = 83.7–89.8%) using Random Forest (RF). In addition, with the HyClass tool, the classification precision varied significantly after reducing the original point density from 8.7 to 1 point/m 2 . The proposed method can provide accurate road mapping to support forest management as an alternative to pixel-based RF classification when the LiDAR point density is higher than 1 point/m 2 .

AB  - Environmental dynamism is gaining ground as a driving force for enterprise transformation. To address the changes, the capabilities of digital enterprises need to adapt. Capability modeling can facilitate this process of transformation. However, a plethora of approaches for capability modeling exist. This study explores how concepts relevant to change have been implemented in the meta-models of these approaches, aiming to visualize relationships among change-related concepts, and identify ways to improve capability modeling toward a more efficient depiction of capability change. The concepts are visualized in concept maps, and a framework is developed to assist the classification of concepts relevant to change functions. Similarities and differences among the existing models are discussed, leading to suggestions toward improvements of capability modeling for capability adaptation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • CREATE pedagogy offers a means for teaching and learning science through the primary literature of a scientific discipline. • In CREATE courses, students apply evidenced-based tools such as concept mapping, drawing, and annotation in deconstructing published research. • Studies of CREATE implementations supports Its efficacy in a variety of science courses with diverse student populations. • In this review, we describe a case-study of CREATE in an upper-level science course, which provides a "how-to" perspective on its use. CREATE (C onsider, R ead, E lucidate hypotheses, A nalyze and interpret data, T hink of the next E xperiment) is a pedagogical approach for teaching and learning science through the rigorous analysis of primary scientific literature. This mini-review focuses on the tools, assignments, and in-class activities by which this strategy immerses students in the process of science and further challenges students to embody the intellectual activities of actual scientists. We highlight the innovative ways in which CREATE pedagogy encourages students to think deeply about science. Applying this strategy has been shown to promote student gains in cognitive and affective behaviors while also fostering the development of science process skills. Herein we also provide a case study of CREATE implementation, which provides a detailed perspective on the realities of teaching with this strategy. Finally, we offer insights gained through the study of this pedagogy at different types of institutions, courses and student populations to demonstrate how CREATE can be broadly applied in STEM education.

AB  - The development of innovative teaching methods is an effective way to promote new science education standards, in view of a positive feedback of the student performance. Despite the teachers positive attitudes towards the application of innovative learning approaches, the rapid progress of science and technology in the last decades requests a renewed global approach and a synergistic organization of the educational contents for an efficient teaching of the scientific topics. Modern teaching programs request then an efficient approach which allows to clearly identify the role of each discipline within the complex organization of the novel scientific concepts. In recent years, the progress in soft condensed matter research was driven by modern methods in both the experimental techniques and the theoretical approaches. In this article, we propose a conceptual map for a multidisciplinary approach of the post-graduate programs in soft condensed matter physics, one of the most important field in modern science and technology scene. We highlight the conceptual interconnection and the synergistic relation between different sub-disciplines of the field. The proposed conceptual map may stimulate the exploration of new approaches for the integration of knowledge and skills both from the experimental and theoretical point of view. In this respect teachers can organize scientific curricula by organizing and representing knowledge conceptually, by developing a curriculum that integrates the different (experimental and theoretical) topics appropriately and by designing environments and tasks that support motivation and (interest-based) cooperative learning.

AB  - Contemporary cartographic practice uses a range of computing technologies to build print and electronic medium maps. Some allow the creation only of simple maps, through manipulation of a constrained set of design parameters (e.g., Mapline or Google's MyMaps). Others allow the manipulation of an expansive range of design elements (e.g., ArcGIS Pro, QGIS, Mapbox). Many software tools for making maps are not built by cartographers, but rather by software engineers, some of whom have limited cartographic training or mapmaking experience. Among the tools developers may use to help them design and implement mapmaking software are standards, such as those developed by groups like the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). The OGC's Portrayal Domain Working Group (DWG) focuses on developing standards to support the visual representation of geospatial information (de la Beaujardiere, 2006; Sorenson, 2019). Its 2019 Charter advocates for a common portrayal framework but focuses more on interoperability of design choices that have been made (encoding of symbols and styles) and less on guidance or good practice of design choices (i.e., which symbol or style to use) (Sorenson, 2019). Cartographic associations (e.g., ICA) have had relatively little involvement with the development of these standards. Thus, a question relevant to our community is to what extent do existing OGC standards reflect good cartographic design practice? Bocher & Ertz (2018) pointed to the low quality of maps using open standards (OGC included). They suggested a stronger focus on cartographic theory in the core OGC Symbology encoding standards and developed a proposed conceptual basis for defining geographical data symbology (Bocher & Ertz, 2020). Periodically, researchers have tried to capture cartographic knowledge to help non-experts make good maps (Forrest, 1993; Brus et al., 2010; Tsorlini et al., 2017) using varied approaches, including expert systems, cartographic workflows, and cartographic ontologies. Software engineers, however, are usually not attempting to design software to entirely replace mapmakers but rather to support the cartographic design process. Their task is to apply a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software (Bourque & Fairly, 2014) for which they need an understanding of the fundamentals of computer science, namely the systematic study of algorithms (i.e., workflows) and data structures (i.e., ontologies) (Gibbs & Tucker, 1986). We consider how we might connect software engineers' knowledge of algorithms and data structures to cartographic expertise via cartographic workflows or cartographic ontologies, respectively. Software engineers are familiar with workflows and often think in such terms (Wing, 2014). A workflow is the series of activities necessary to complete a task (ISO 12967-1:2020) and can be distinguished from an expert system in that it is not able to learn from experience and is therefore more constrained in its operations and outcomes (Aniba et al., 2009). As an unstructured problem, the cartographic design process is contingent in nature; design decisions are influenced by a multiplicity of contextual factors (Griffin et al., 2017). This characteristic suggests potentially it might help to combine workflows with design patterns (Coetzee & Rautenbach, 2017), when seeking to communicate cartographic knowledge to software engineers. Software engineers are also familiar with schema representation of data and information. Ontology design patterns (ODP) are general templates that describe entities and relations for topical information schemas. Their development often begins as concept maps or a set of natural language propositions stating the core constraints to be represented by the schema. They guide the design of applied ontologies by suggesting a formal logic semantic structure among sets of objects and literal annotation (Fig. 1). Concurrently, Knowledge Representation and Reasoning expertise has developed to make concept models dynamic through executable logic. Such general schemas are refined by communities in application to take local practices and approaches into account (D'Ignazio & Klein, 2019). As we are still at the beginning of this project, it is not yet clear to us whether workflows or ODPs will be a more fruitful approach to communicating cartographic design knowledge to software engineers. The topical subject domain content that will be formally specified in ODPs is normally debated among communities. Through this presentation, we are seeking community feedback on what cartographic workflows and map design core concepts are most important to make accessible to developers. We present our initial thinking on what we consider to be core concepts and workflows. We believe our project can provide benefit to developers designing software for use by people and for the construction of automated tools. Cartographic workflows and ontologies can support the approach of building expert systems, or others based on artificial intelligence, to construct solutions that can help users build knowledge and helpful maps within the current panorama of an abundance of available spatial data.

AB  - In partnership with the United Nations Geospatial Information Section the International Cartographic Association (ICA) has recently published the textbook "Mapping for a Sustainable World". It aims to bring best practices and methods in cartography to support to uncover challenges and achievements towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The maps and diagrams discussed help to better understand the relationship between humans and their environments as well as enable us to monitor SDG indicators and communicate their uneven global footprints. The objective of the maps and diagrams is to support decision making by local and national authorities, as well as to promote public awareness of global issues to encourage these authorities to act. The book discusses and explains why some design decisions are not suitable for certain mapping contexts, which results in flawed or even misleading maps and diagrams. However, issues also arise from improper data handling, distracting symbols and text, confusing map elements, and the (mis)use of software defaults. The main objective is not to offer fixed rules, but to hand recommendations to avoid common pitfalls in cartographic design. The book [1] is published as an open access document according to the CC BY-NC license [2] and is available via the United Nations Digital Library. The indicator data and boundaries will also be made available. This open content is part of an open education environment. This environment will also include other open educational resources. This paper describes one of these tools that will help both teachers and students structure there teaching and learning respectively in the domain of cartography with a strong link to the Sustainable Development Goals. With the ubiquitous availability of online resources and media, the process of teaching and learning, and knowledge sharing in general, has evolved significantly over the last decades. With the growing demand for flexibility in education, the process of learning has become increasingly non-linear; knowledge acquisition is done via different pathways over several content resources and teaching components. At the same time, increasingly use is made of a combination of independently created knowledge resources and the meaning of the connections between them become obscure. In such cases a clear structure of content is needed to understand the conceptual connections between the different knowledge components. In the context of ITC's Open Education environment, a tool was developed called the Living Textbook [3] to create and consume both knowledge content and structure. The latter is represented in a concept map, which holds small units of content, represented as circles, and their relationships, represented as text-labelled arrows. Each combination of two concepts forms a so-called triple, a short sentence that describes their relationship, e.g. Choropleth map is a kind of Thematic map. Use in education. The core content of the education at ITC has been migrated from a traditional textbook into the Living Textbook. This allows students to set their own learning paths and supports us to connect to content of follow-up courses in a constructive manner. In other education activities the Living Textbook is used by students to create their own content, based on supervised research activities. Use in knowledge sharing. In several projects we use the Living Textbook to collaboratively create a knowledge base of shared content. In the EO4GEO project [4] the Living Textbook is the main editor for the creation of the Body of Knowledge (BoK) for Geo-information and Earth Observation. This BoK contains over 900 connected concepts created and maintained by a group of experts. The concepts form the building blocks for linking education and the labour market in the European EO/GI sector. In another project we use the same method to build a consolidated view on Citizen Science and related project activities. In this paper we are following a similar approach (see Figure 1) to connect concepts in cartography and to make explicit how they can be applied to SDG issues, as described in the book. In all of the conceptual modelling done with concept maps, one of the challenges is to find the right granularity of concepts and comprehensive relationships between the concepts, which are understandable for end users. In our case these are researchers and educators who would like to reuse specific content parts of the book and refer to it through hyperlinks. We have chosen to take the glossary of the textbook as a starting point and started to conceptualise each chapter as well as the SDG goals, targets and indicators. In this way a hierarchical structure is prevalent in cartographic concepts, supporting an intuitive way of exploration, in combination with specific relations between SDGs, map representations and cartographic concepts. Research and development is ongoing to improve several aspects of the use of concept maps, through 1) learning analytics, 2) alternative concept map visualisations and 3) application of semantic web principles and linked open data, see [5]. A link is foreseen with ICA's BoK which is currently being developed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The physical space, which includes the built environment and the corresponding geographical information, can be naturally perceived by human beings by vision. The informational space, which includes cultures, events, social relations and other information that is spatially referenced to objects and locations, can only be represented mentally. The development of information communication technology has promoted the integration of informational space (e.g., humanistic, social-media and cyber spaces) and physical space. This integrated space itself can convey senses of place to people based on what knowledge the places possess. However, it is hard for human to obtain visual experience as what is available in conventional physical space, which leads to a need to research novel theories and methods of the physical-informational space visualization. Mixed reality (MR) offers visual access for humans to perceiving information and acquiring knowledge in real scenes, by augmenting multiple types of virtual objects involves texts, symbols, images, and graphs. With a series of key informative clues such as properties, events, and social relations, individuals are capable to structure knowledge related to certain places, and get contextually specific and episodic understandings of their daily living space. Locationreferenced information is getting increasingly rich in everyday life. Overly rich information can lead to poor attention, high cognitive loads, and complicated interaction with humans, and thus cause inefficient visual searching for key information. Therefore, there is a need to develop an MR-based visualization interface for users to better perceive information and acquire knowledge from real scenes. Concept maps are classic knowledge visualization used to reduce the amount and complexity of information and to improve user understanding of certain concepts. Node-link map is the basis of concept mapping, which structures knowledge from disorganized information based on informative nodes and links that represent relationships. Concept maps can present an overview and detailed information simultaneously, allowing users to navigate from high-level abstract concepts to low-level information pieces. During the navigation of information, users can discover patterns of knowledge from information series, that is, understanding how certain knowledge is formed and concluded. In addition, with the help of concept maps as an assist of thinking and learning, users are likely to form mental models for recognizing new knowledge patterns, discover new connections of information, and visualize the unknown. The top-down navigation and learning method based on concept maps is a proper way for individuals to acquire knowledge in real scenes with the help of mixed reality. Instead of searching for useful information from complex visualizations, users can directly navigate between key nodes related to spatial places with sematic information. They can get the main idea that the cartographer or designer would like to convey with the mixed reality knowledge visualization, and figure out why they can come to the point of view by exploring premade knowledge structures. For example, a place can include several feelings that visitors have, such as being clean, crowded, and fashionable. Users who are interested in why there is clean may actively interact with the "clean" node, and discover and explore the sub tree or networks that each node is connected to certain places or concepts like more frequent garbage collection, far with factories, and lower air pollution, and then get the answers of their questions. Some knowledge can be overly informative and complex that consists of lots of information pieces, making it hard to memorize. By exploring the knowledge spatially and semantically simultaneously, like experiencing a story, users can form episodic memory integrated with spatial, temporal, and event information, which makes the memory stronger. In this project, I would like to solve the following scientific questions: a) What are the design principles and strategies for the knowledge visualization with location-based concept mapping in mixed reality; b) whether the proposed knowledge visualization can improve users' cognitive processes, including knowledge acquiring, memorizing, and using.

AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real‐world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers' concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers' ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi‐directional peer‐assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system can not only increase students' learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment.

AB  - There has been an increasing trend of land area being brought under human's use over time. This situation has led the community to carry out land-use development activities in landslide hazard-prone areas. The use of land can have a positive impact by increasing economic conditions, but it can have negative impacts on the environment. Therefore, this study aimed to identify the landslide hazard, focusing on the development of a landform map to reduce the risk of landslide disaster in JLS, Malang Regency. The integration of remote sensing and geographic information systems, as well as field observation, were used to create a landform map and a landslide susceptibility map. Using the geomorphological approach as a basic concept in landform mapping, the morphology, morphogenesis, and morphoarrangement conditions were obtained from the remote sensing data, GIS, and field observation, while morphochronological information was obtained from a geological map. The landslide susceptibility map was prepared using 11 landslide conditioning factors by employing the index of entropy method. Thirty-nine landform units were successfully mapped into four landslide susceptibility classes. The results showed that the study area is dominated by a high level of landslide susceptibility with a majority of moderate to strongly eroded hill morphology. It also reaffirms that landform mapping is a reliable method by which to investigate landslide susceptibility in JLS, Malang Regency. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim: The purpose of this paper is to provide a clear definition of the concept of a nurse influencer. Background: While the nursing profession is known for caring, advocacy, and trustworthiness, the nurse influencer is an emerging concept in health care. Clarification of this concept is essential to understand the necessary characteristics and potential opportunities for the nurse influencer. Methods: Walker and Avant's method of concept synthesis and analysis was used. Results: With time, self‐efficacy, and a measurable intention, a nurse can become a nurse influencer. A nurse influencer is a nurse who has a platform to affect change through demonstrating integrity, a dedication to learning, and excellent communication of ideas and information. In addition to creating change, the nurse influencer may also disseminate knowledge and generate empowerment for themselves and others. Conclusion: This concept analysis, the first focusing on the nurse influencer, provides an explanation of this concept and a concept map of the nurse influencer's attributes and contributions.

AB  - Creative geovisualization is situated at the intersection of geography, arts, and digital humanities with a particular emphasis on visualization and mapping that preserves, represents, and generates more authentic, contextual, and nuanced meanings of space and people with an artistic and humanistic perspective and approach. This is a creative expansion in critical GIS practices and a new alternative to traditionally science‐rooted approaches to GIS and mapping. Reflecting the experience of teaching a "creative geovisualization" course in an interdisciplinary curriculum, I demonstrate how critical and creative scholarship with mapping and geovisualization is introduced in the classroom and is illuminated in the students' creative practices. The class encompasses key epistemological and methodological groundings of creative geovisualization—including non‐representational theories; critical cartography and GIS; the convergence of geography, arts, and humanities; psychogeography; and qualitative and affective geovisualization. Empirical examples of students' works illustrate the blending of different modes of creative engagements with GIS and geovisualization and specific ways to work with various forms of embodied, relational, interpretive, and expressive geographies. GIS and mapping become creative as they continue evolving in process, and it is time that we deeply (re‐)imagine "the creative" in/of GIS in critical GIS pedagogies. Key Messages: Creative and critical engagements with GIS and critical GIS pedagogy highlight the convergence of geography, arts, and humanities.Teaching critical and creative forms of GIS helps students embrace and generate various modes of data and analysis that value representation in different ways.The integration of the creative in/of GIS points towards a new form of qualitative, affective, and creative GIS and geovisualization.

AB  - Enseigner la géovisualisation créative: imaginer autrement les SIG La géovisualisation créative est située à l'ntersection de la géographie, des arts et des sciences humaines numériques avec un accent particulier sur la visualisation et la cartographie. Cette démarche préserve, représente et génère des significations plus authentiques, plus contextuelles et plus nuancées de l'espace et des gens selon des perspectives artistiques et humanistes. Il s'agit ici d'une innovation à partir des pratiques des SIG critiques et d'une nouvelle solution de rechange aux approches traditionnellement des SIG ancrées dans la science. Témoignant de l'expérience de l'enseignement d'un cours de « géovisualisation créative » à l'intérieur d'un programme interdisciplinaire, nous démontrons de quelle manière les missions professorales critique et créative face à la cartographie et la géovisualisation sont introduites dans la salle de classe afin de stimuler les pratiques créatives des étudiants. L'enseignement englobe les bases épistémologiques et méthodologiques clés de la géovisualisation créative qui se résument aux éléments suivants: les théories non représentatives, la cartographie et les SIG critiques, la convergence de la géographie, des arts et des sciences humaines, la psychogéographie et la géovisualisation qualitative et affective. Des exemples empiriques de travaux d'étudiants illustrent le mélange de différents modes d'engagements créatifs avec les SIG et la géovisualisation ainsi que les façons particulières de travailler avec diverses formes de géographies intégrées, relationnelles, interprétatives et expressives. Les SIG et la cartographie deviennent créatifs alors qu'ils continuent d'évoluer et il est temps que nous (ré)imaginions en profondeur « le caractère créatif » des SIG en lui‐même et dans la pédagogie des SIG critiques.

AB  - • The main reason for the problems of modern soil mapping is the lack of theory. • Hopes to solve the problems using only technological advances are unjustified. • An interdisciplinary approach is needed to solve the problems of soil mapping. • Traditional and digital soil mapping should be integrated. • A possible way to solve the problems of modern soil mapping is proposed. • Multiscale soil-landscape maps systematically reflect soil-landscape relationships. The article analyzes the problems of modern soil mapping and offers a new, interdisciplinary approach to overcoming them. Among these problems, the most noticeable are the following: harmonization and thematic content of soil maps, multiscale soil mapping, and global soil map. It is shown that the main reasons of problems in modern soil mapping are the recognition of the priority of the practical purposes of soil mapping over the scientific ones, the lack of understanding of the relationship between soil mapping and the conceptual soil classification, the neglect or misuse of the systems approach and contemporary theories of classification, the lack of a universal soil classification system, and an orientation toward new technological advances. It is emphasized that hopes for a successful solution to the problems of soil mapping using the latest technologies, tools and methods are largely unjustified, since, first of all, a consistent theory of soil mapping is necessary. The theoretical foundations and technology for multiscale soil-landscape mapping in a GIS environment are described. Multiscale soil-landscape maps are defined as a system of interconnected maps of all scale ranges, which have a single classification basis and coordinated thematic content. They contain integrated information about soils and landscape systems, which are landscapes, considered from the point of view of the systems approach, and display soils mainly as derived landscape system elements. Another distinctive feature of multiscale soil-landscape maps is that they reflect the relationship between soil properties, on the one hand, and properties of the basic landscape system elements (parent rocks, air, water, and organisms), on the other. The advantages of multiscale soil-landscape mapping in comparison with traditional and digital are shown. From a practical point of view, multiscale soil-landscape maps are considered as the basis for making scientifically sound decisions on sustainable nature management at all levels - from global to local.

AB  - One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics' teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics' conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education.

AB  - Intrusion detection tools have largely benefitted from the usage of supervised classification methods developed in the field of data mining. However, the data produced by modern system/network logs pose many problems, such as the streaming and non-stationary nature of such data, their volume and velocity, and the presence of imbalanced classes. Classifier ensembles look a valid solution for this scenario, owing to their flexibility and scalability. In particular, data-driven schemes for combining the predictions of multiple classifiers have been shown superior to traditional fixed aggregation criteria (e.g., predictions' averaging and weighted voting). In intrusion detection settings, however, such schemes must be devised in an efficient way, since (part of) the ensemble may need to be re-trained frequently. A novel ensemble-based framework is proposed here for the online intrusion detection, where the ensemble is updated through an incremental stream-oriented learning scheme, correspondingly to the detection of concept drifts. Differently from mainstream ensemble-based approaches in the field, our proposal relies on deriving, though an efficient genetic programming (GP) method, an expressive kind of combiner function defined in terms of (non-trainable) aggregation functions. This approach is supported by a system architecture, which integrates different kinds of functionalities, ranging from the drift detection, to the induction and replacement of base classifiers, up to the distributed computation of GP-based combiners. Experiments on both artificial and real-life datasets confirmed the validity of the approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • CSS is a stable structure algorithm in the literature. • The opposition-based learning structure is integrated into CSS. • The parameter estimation of the AC filters is an important engineering problem. • Parameter estimation of low and high pass filters was done with CSS and OCSS. • The predictive filter parameters were successfully estimated. Algorithms are frequently used to solve problems that have a large search space and take a long time to be mathematically solved. They can later be improved with different improvement methods based on the structure and the type of the problem. In this study, the charged system search algorithm (CSS), which has been successfully implemented in the solutions of numerous engineering problems studied within the literature, was improved by introducing opposition-based learning method (OBL) to it in two different methods. With these improved algorithms, solutions were developed for 30-dimensional multimodal test functions in the first place and the results were discussed. In the second place, the parameters of active filters given below were determined from E24 standard series with developed approaches. Filters are electronic circuits that enhance the wanted frequency components of electric signals applied on their inputs and remove harmonics and interferences from these signals. They are divided into two types; active and passive filters. Active filters are produced with transistors or op-amps. They are financially more advantageous compared to passive filters. These filters are preferred especially in low frequencies due to their low costs. Adjustable for a large frequency domain, active filters are very convenient in terms of size and weight and their designs are highly simple. They can easily be connected successively without affecting one another. In this study, the parameter values of Sallen-Key topology Butterworth low and high-pass active filters, which have an extensive area of use, were determined through improved algorithms. My suggestions for the future studies are these: the effects of the opposite position learning approach on other heuristic algorithms can be analysed solving test functions and different engineering problems; different approaches other than the two approaches proposed in this study, can be developed for the opposite position learning concept; LPF and HPF designs solved in the study can be solved for different degrees and stages and finally new designs can be done for different filter types and different resistor and capacitor series that haven't been handled in this study.

AB  - Gossans are surficial deposits that form in host bedrock by the alteration of sulphides by acidic and oxidizing fluids. These deposits are typically a few meters to kilometers in size and they constitute important vectors to buried ore deposits. Hundreds of gossans have been mapped by field geologists in sparsely vegetated areas of the Canadian Arctic. However, due to Canada's vast northern landmass, it is highly probable that many existing occurrences have been missed. In contrast, a variety of remote sensing data has been acquired in recent years, allowing for a broader survey of gossans from orbit. These include band ratioing or methods based on principal component analysis. Spectrally, the 809 gossans used in this study show no significant difference from randomly placed points on the Landsat 8 imageries. To overcome this major issue, we propose a deep learning method based on convolutional neural networks and relying on geo big data (Landsat-8, Arctic digital elevation model lithological maps) that can be used for the detection of gossans. Its application in different regions in the Canadian Arctic shows great promise, with precisions reaching 77%. This first order approach could provide a useful precursor tool to identify gossans prior to more detailed surveys using hyperspectral imaging. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The hippocampal formation encodes maps of space and a key question in neuroscience is whether its spatial coding principles also provide a universal metric for the organization of nonspatial, conceptual information. Previous work demonstrated directional coding during navigation through a continuous stimulus feature space as well as mapping of distances in a feature space that was relevant for concept learning. Here we provide the first unambiguous evidence for a hippocampal representation of the actual concept space, by showing that the hippocampal distance signal selectively reflects the mapping of specifically conceptually relevant rather than of all feature dimensions. During fMRI scanning of 32 human participants (21 females), we presented everyday objects, which had beforehand been associated with specific values on three continuous feature dimensions. Crucially, only two dimensions were relevant to prior concept learning. We find that hippocampal responses to the objects reflect their relative distances in a space defined along conceptually relevant dimensions compared with distances in a space defined along all feature dimensions. These findings suggest that the hippocampus supports knowledge acquisition by dynamically encoding information in a space spanned along dimensions that are relevant in relation to define concepts.

AB  - Introduction: HIV continues to devastate the adolescent population in sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA). The complex array of interpersonal, social, structural and system‐level obstacles specific to adolescents have slowed progress in prevention and treatment of HIV in this population. The field of implementation science holds promise for addressing these challenges. Discussion: There is growing consensus that enhanced interactions between researchers and users of scientific evidence are important and necessary to tackle enduring barriers to implementation. In 2017, the Fogarty International Center launched the Adolescent HIV Prevention and Treatment Implementation Science Alliance (AHISA) to promote communication and catalyse collaboration among implementation scientists and implementers to enhance the cross‐fertilization of insights as research advances and the implementation environment evolves. This network has identified key implementation science questions for adolescent HIV, assessed how members' research is addressing them, and is currently conducting a concept mapping exercise to more systematically identify implementation research priorities. In addition, AHSA pinpointed common challenges to addressing these questions and discussed their collective capacity to conduct implementation science using the shared learning approach of the network. Specifically, AHISA addresses challenges related to capacity building, developing mentorship, engaging stakeholders, and involving adolescents through support for training efforts and funding region‐/country‐specific networks that respond to local issues and increase implementation science capacity across SSA. Conclusions: Innovative platforms, like AHISA, that foster collaborations between implementation science researchers, policymakers and community participants to prioritizes research needs and identify and address implementation challenges can speed the translation of effective HIV interventions to benefit adolescent health.

AB  - Statistical Machine Learning (SML) refers to a body of algorithms and methods by which computers are allowed to discover important features of input data sets which are often very large in size. The very task of feature discovery from data is essentially the meaning of the keyword 'learning' in SML. Theoretical justifications for the effectiveness of the SML algorithms are underpinned by sound principles from different disciplines, such as Computer Science and Statistics. The theoretical underpinnings particularly justified by statistical inference methods are together termed as statistical learning theory. This paper provides a review of SML from a Bayesian decision theoretic point of view—where we argue that many SML techniques are closely connected to making inference by using the so called Bayesian paradigm. We discuss many important SML techniques such as supervised and unsupervised learning, deep learning, online learning and Gaussian processes especially in the context of very large data sets where these are often employed. We present a dictionary which maps the key concepts of SML from Computer Science and Statistics. We illustrate the SML techniques with three moderately large data sets where we also discuss many practical implementation issues. Thus the review is especially targeted at statisticians and computer scientists who are aspiring to understand and apply SML for moderately large to big data sets. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Various statistical learning techniques are compared in country and global models. • The TROPOMI instrument measurements are evaluated in the models. • The daytime and nighttime NO 2 are modelled separately for exposure assessment. • The ensemble tree-based methods are promising for global mapping. • The spatial prediction patterns need to be considered in the validation process. In countries where air pollution stations are unavailable or scarce, station measurements from other countries and atmospheric remote sensing could jointly provide information to estimate ambient air quality at a sufficiently fine resolution to study the relationship between air pollution exposure and health. Predicting NO 2 concentration globally with sufficient spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy for health studies is, however, not a trivial task. Challenges are data deficiency, in terms of NO 2 measurements and NO 2 predictors, and the development of a statistical model that can typify the regional and continental differences, such as traffic regulations, energy sources, and local weather. We investigated the feasibility of mapping daytime and nighttime NO 2 globally at a high spatial resolution (25 m), by including TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) data and comparing various statistical learning techniques. We separated daytime (7:00 am - 9:59 pm) and nighttime (10:00 pm - 6:59 am) based on the local times. To study if one should build models for each country separately, national models in 4 selected countries (the US, China, Germany, Spain) were developed. We build the models for 2017 and used 3636 stations. Seven statistical learning techniques were applied and the impact of the predictors, model fitting, and predicting accuracy was compared between different techniques, national models, national and global models, and models with and without including the NO 2 vertical column density retrieved from TROPOMI. The ensemble tree-based methods obtained higher accuracy compared to the linear regression-based methods in national and global models. The global tree-based methods obtained similar accuracy to national models. Different spatial prediction patterns are observed even when the prediction accuracy is very similar. Separating between day and night can be important for more accurate air pollution exposure assessment. The TROPOMI variable is ranked as one of the most important variables in the statistical learning techniques but adding it to global models that contain other precedent remote sensing products does not improve the prediction accuracy.

AB  - The term describing the students’ notions of scientific concepts dissimilar from scientifically acceptable by the scientist is still debated. This study explores of how scientific concepts performed by high school students (HSSs), pre-service teachers (PSTs), and in-service teachers (ISTs) simultaneously to make clear between their conception vs. scientists’ conception, especially in the ionization energy concept. Therefore, it is crucial to raise the position of scientific conception and misconception. For diagnosing the misconceptions, some methods can be used: concept maps, interviews, multiple-choice tests (one-tier), multiple-tier tests (two-tier, three-tier, fourtiers), open-ended tests, and others. This study utilized multiple-tier tests with three-tier. Totally, 326 participants from Indonesia, including 118 HSSs, 165 PSTs, and 43 ISTs majoring in chemistry, were invited to complete an online -Ionization Energy Diagnostic-Modification (IEDI*M) test. The test consisted of 12 three-tier diagnostic items. The study indicated four substantial alternative conceptions were acknowledged: conservation of energy, half-filled sub-shells or stable fully-filled, octet rule framework, and relation-based reasoning. ISTs performed better than HSSs and PSTs on the understanding of ionization energy. The study has also specified the distribution of ionization energy conceptions of Group 1 and 2, and Period 2 and 3 on the periodic system. By utilizing the IEDI*M, the percentages of alternative concepts decreased from one-tier to two-tier and from two-tier to three-tier. This study gives some implications for the government, policy-makers, chemistry teachers, preservice teachers, and university faculty members. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Istilah mendeskripsikan pemahaman siswa tentang konsep-konsep ilmiah yang berbeda dengan yang diterima secara ilmiah oleh ilmuwan masih menjadi perdebatan. Penelitian ini mengeksplor bagaimana konsep ilmiah yang ditunjukkan oleh siswa sekolah menengah atas (HSS), guru pra-jabatan (PST), dan guru dalam jabatan (IST) secara bersamaan untuk memperjelas antara konsepsi mereka vs konsepsi ilmuwan terutama atas konsep energi ionisasi. Oleh karena itu, penting untuk mengangkat posisi konsepsi ilmiah dan miskonsepsi. Untuk mendiagnosis kesalahpahaman, beberapa metode dapat digunakan: peta konsep, wawancara, tes pilihan ganda (satu tingkat), tes beberapa tingkat (dua tingkat, tiga tingkat, empat tingkat), tes terbuka, dan lainnya. Penelitian ini menggunakan tes tiga tingkat. Penelitian ini mengeksplorasi pemahaman konsep energi ionisasi antara siswa sekolah menengah (HSS), guru pra-jabatan (PST), dan guru dalam jabatan (IST) secara bersamaan. Sebanyak 326 peserta dari Indonesia, termasuk 118 HSS, 165 PST, dan 43 IST bidang kimia diundang untuk mengikuti tes online -Ionization Energy Diagnostic-Modification (IEDI * M). Tes terdiri dari 12 butir tes diagnostik tiga tingkat. Riset ini menunjukkan empat konsepsi alternatif substansial: konservasi energi, subkulit terisi setengah atau terisi penuh stabil, kerangka aturan oktet, dan penalaran berbasis hubungan. IST berkinerja lebih baik daripada HSS dan PST dalam pemahaman energi ionisasi. Riset ini juga telah menentukan distribusi konsepsi energi ionisasi dari Golongan 1 dan 2, dan Periode 2 dan 3 pada sistem periodik. Dengan memanfaatkan IEDI * M, persentase konsepsi alternatif menurun dari satu tingkat ke dua tingkat serta dari dua tingkat ke tiga tingkat. Penelitian ini memberikan beberapa implikasi bagi pemerintah, pembuat kebijakan, guru kimia, guru pra-jabatan, dan staf pengajar di universitas. (Indonesian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - O termo que descreve as noções dos alunos de conceitos científicos diferentes dos cientificamente aceitáveis pelo cientista ainda é debatido. Este estudo explora como conceitos científicos realizados por alunos do ensino médio (HSSs), professores em formação (PSTs) e professores em serviço (ISTs) simultaneamente para tornar claro entre sua concepção vs. concepção dos cientistas, principalmente no conceito de energia de ionização. Portanto, é fundamental levantar a posição da concepção científica e do equívoco. Para diagnosticar os equívocos, alguns métodos podem ser usados: mapas conceituais, entrevistas, testes de múltipla escolha (uma camada), testes de várias camadas (duas camadas, três camadas, quatro camadas), testes abertos e outras. Este estudo usou testes de várias camadas com três camadas. No total, 326 participantes da Indonésia, incluindo 118 HSSs, 165 PSTs e 43 ISTs com especialização em química, foram convidados a concluir um teste on-line de Diagnóstico-Modificação de Energia de Ionização (IEDI * M). O teste consistiu em 12 itens de diagnóstico de três níveis. O estudo indicou que quatro conceitos alternativos substanciais foram reconhecidos: conservação de energia, sub-camadas preenchidas pela metade ou totalmente preenchidas estáveis, estrutura de regras do octeto e raciocínio baseado em relações. Os ISTs tiveram um desempenho melhor do que os HSSs e PSTs no entendimento da energia de ionização. O estudo também especificou a distribuição das concepções de energia de ionização do Grupo 1 e 2, e Período 2 e 3 no sistema periódico. Ao utilizar o IEDI * M, as porcentagens de conceitos alternativos diminuíram de um nível para dois níveis e de dois para três níveis. Este estudo oferece algumas implicações para o governo, formuladores de políticas, professores de química, professores em formação e membros do corpo docente universitário.

AB  - PURPOSE: As data-sharing projects become increasingly frequent, so does the need to map data elements between multiple classification systems. A generic, robust, shareable architecture will result in increased efficiency and transparency of the mapping process, while upholding the integrity of the data. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The American Association for Cancer Research's Genomics Evidence Neoplasia Information Exchange (GENIE) collects clinical and genomic data for precision cancer medicine. As part of its commitment to open science, GENIE has partnered with the National Cancer Institute's Genomic Data Commons (GDC) as a secondary repository. After initial efforts to submit data from GENIE to GDC failed, we realized the need for a solution to allow for the iterative mapping of data elements between dynamic classification systems. We developed the Linked Entity Attribute Pair (LEAP) database framework to store and manage the term mappings used to submit data from GENIE to GDC. RESULTS: After creating and populating the LEAP framework, we identified 195 mappings from GENIE to GDC requiring remediation and observed a 28% reduction in effort to resolve these issues, as well as a reduction in inadvertent errors. These results led to a decrease in the time to map between OncoTree, the cancer type ontology used by GENIE, and International Classification of Disease for Oncology, 3rd Edition, used by GDC, from several months to less than 1 week. CONCLUSION: The LEAP framework provides a streamlined mapping process among various classification systems and allows for reusability so that efforts to create or adjust mappings are straightforward. The ability of the framework to track changes over time streamlines the process to map data elements across various dynamic classification systems. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving. Studies of the usefulness and psychometric properties of the new assessments are needed with different groups and in different contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps were created as one of six measures to identify exceptionally talented students during the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM (CDTIS) project, with the goal of identifying and nurturing talents in students from groups traditionally underrepresented in special programs. New methods were compared with conventional methods to select students for an internship in the laboratories of scientists. In this article, we describe development, field testing, and implementation of the concept map assessments in life and physical science. Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: unknown, maybe, probably, definitely, and wow. The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t (41), p >.38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study analyzed the impact of different analogical learning approaches (analogies or metaphors) integrated with different presentation modalities (pictures or texts) on middle school students' learning performance of electricity with supporting evidence from their eye movement behaviors. Eighty ninth-grade middle school students were randomly assigned into four groups to receive four different versions of an online electricity learning program, including pictorial analogies, textual analogies, pictorial metaphors, and textual metaphors. Data regarding students' eye movement behaviors were collected simultaneously during their online learning. All the students took a pre-test, post-test, and retention test covering their comprehension of electricity concepts. Our results revealed that the analogy group provided more mapping and integration behaviors between the analog and target concepts about electricity, resulting in gaining better performance than the metaphor group. Additionally, students receiving pictorial modality generated more mapping and integration behaviors between the analog and target concepts, resulting in a better understanding of electricity concepts than students learning with textual modality. The associated implications for analogical learning approaches and presentation modalities concerning science learning and eye movement behaviors are also discussed in the paper.

AB  - Background. Nursing students perceive human physiology as one of the most challenging courses, and it is also the course most often failed. To address this perceived challenge, a university campus introduced concept mapping to facilitate learning among nursing students in the human physiology course. Despite evidence of its use in other disciplines and educational contexts, it is not known how nursing students perceive and experience its use when learning human physiology. Objective. To explore and describe the perceptions and experiences of nursing students' use of concept mapping as a learning tool in a human physiology course. Methods. A qualitative descriptive study was conducted at a university campus in Namibia. Data were obtained through three focus group discussions with 18 second-year nursing students in the Bachelor of Nursing Science (Clinical) Honours programme, who were conveniently sampled. Transcriptions from the discussions were analysed following Tesch's 8-step coding process. Ethical approval and permission to conduct the study were granted by the campus Research Ethics Committee in the School of Nursing, University of Namibia. Results. Four themes emerged from the analysis: concept mapping facilitates deep learning; concept mapping as a group activity; effects of concept mapping on students' academic performance; and implications of concept mapping for learning resources. Conclusion. Nursing students had positive experiences and perceptions of concept mapping as a learning tool for human physiology. However, students felt that this learning tool is time consuming and requires many learning resources. Considering its benefits for learning, it is recommended that concept mapping be used as it promotes deep learning, which in turn leads to in-depth knowledge of human physiology. Nevertheless, students should be guided on time-management strategies and learning resource options available in resource-constrained settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The flipped learning approach has been growing in popularity in both higher education and K-12, especially for its potential to increase active learning and student engagement. However, further research is needed to understand exactly how the flipped approach enhances student engagement. This narrative systematic review synthesises literature published between 2012 and 2018, focused on the flipped learning approach in K-12 contexts, and indexed in 7 international databases. 107 articles, book chapters, dissertations, conference papers and grey literature were included for review, and the results are discussed against a bioecological model of student engagement. The results indicate that the majority of research has been undertaken in North American and Asian high schools, heavily focused on student perceptions of flipped learning and achievement within STEM subjects, especially Mathematics, with a slight preference for quantitative methods. Studies in this review found the approach to overwhelmingly support student engagement, with 93% of studies citing at least one dimension of behavioural, affective or cognitive engagement, whereas 50% of studies reported facets of disengagement. Collaborative technologies such as Google Docs, Google Classroom and Edmodo were particularly linked to engagement, with videos not created by teachers more likely to lead to disengagement. Only 12% included a definition of student engagement, and less than half used a theoretical framework. Future empirical research should ensure that all contextual information is included, including year level of student participants, that multiple methods of both quantitative and qualitative data collection are included, and close attention is paid to grounding research in theory. Further research is needed on parent, teacher and school leader perceptions, as well as longitudinal and multiple-class studies. • 93% of studies found at least one engagement dimension & 50% at least one disengagement dimension. • Most found indicators: Increased interaction, enjoyment, participation & confidence. • Collaborative LMS/tools particularly improve engagement in flipped learning. • Teacher-created videos are more likely to lead to task completion & overall engagement. • More research needed on parent, school leader & teacher perceptions.

AB  - The Martian surface is incised by numerous valley networks, which indicate the planet experienced sustained widespread flowing water in the past (e.g. Carr in Water on Mars, Oxford University Press, New York, 1996; Phil Trans R Soc A 370:2193–2212, 2012. 10.1098/rsta.2011.0500). Examining the distribution and geometries of these valley networks provides invaluable information about the Martian climate during the period of formation. The recent advancement in high resolution images has provided an opportunity to build upon past valley maps of Mars (Bahia et al. in LPSC 2018, 2018), however, the identification of these valley networks is extremely time-consuming. A citizen science project may aid in reducing this time-consuming process; this project conducts a valley mapping task with participants of varying expertise in valley mapping to determine whether a citizen science project of this kind should be worth pursuing. This was conducted in a region adjacent to Vogel Crater (36.1° S, 10.2° W). Repeated mapping of the area (a repeatability test) found that participants with low experience in valley mapping (22 a-level physics student's representative of the public) were inconsistent when mapping valleys. Additionally, when comparing the results of participants within this group (a reproducibility test), the majority of reproduced valleys are false positives (i.e. incorrectly traced valleys). These results were consistent with those found for the medium experience group (45 2nd year geology undergraduates). The validated tracings of the low experience group improve upon the number and total length of valleys mapped by previous studies (Hynek et al. in J Geophys Res 115:1–14, 2010). To validate these valleys requires the input of an expert to remove false positives which is less time consuming than manually mapping the images; this may indicate that a citizen science project is worth pursuing. However, to effectively identify the maximum amount of valleys an expert is required. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Over the last few centuries, mapping the ocean seabed has been a major challenge for marine geoscientists. Knowledge of seabed bathymetry and morphology has significantly impacted our understanding of our planet dynamics. The history and scientific trends of seabed mapping can be assessed by data mining prior studies. Here, we have mined the scientific literature using the keyword "seabed mapping" to investigate and provide the evolution of mapping methods and emphasize the main trends and challenges over the last 90 years. An increase in related scientific production was observed in the beginning of the 1970s, together with an increased interest in new mapping technologies. The last two decades have revealed major shift in ocean mapping. Besides the range of applications for seabed mapping, terms like habitat mapping and concepts of seabed classification and backscatter began to appear. This follows the trend of investments in research, science, and technology but is mainly related to national and international demands regarding defining that country's exclusive economic zone, the interest in marine mineral and renewable energy resources, the need for spatial planning, and the scientific challenge of understanding climate variability. The future of seabed mapping brings high expectations, considering that this is one of the main research and development themes for the United Nations Decade of the Oceans. We may expect a new higher resolution ocean seafloor map that might be as influential as The Floor of the Oceans map. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps make connections between ideas apparent, and thus would seem ideally suited to demonstrate learning. Yet, they are not widely used by instructors, particularly in large university classes. In this paper we review the strengths and rationale behind concept maps and provide examples we have used to structure content for one of our introductory courses. A rubric that focuses on propositions was used to grade student-created concept maps on a final exam administered to 293 students. These grades are compared to those of multiple-choice questions, short answers, and an essay on the same exam. We find poor correlation between concept maps and the other instruments, and stronger correlations between short answers and multiple choice, as well as between short-answer content grades and essay writing grades. We speculate that concept maps may be less influenced by student language skills and short-term memory than written answers, and that concept maps should be used as an alternative assessment of higher-order thinking skills.

AB  - Many methods have been developed for managing groups in active learning classes, but little research has been done on the effect of group structure itself. Results are presented for an active learning physics class in which half of the class was placed in academically homogeneous groups while the other half was in heterogeneous groups. Students were given the Conceptual Survey of Electricity and Magnetism as a pretest and posttest, and also filled out surveys on their experiences in their groups. The study was intended to be continued for three years, but was terminated halfway through the second semester as the evidence had become sufficiently compelling that placing half of the class in academically heterogeneous groups was placing them at a significant disadvantage. Student feedback, pretest, and posttest data indicated that low- and middle-performing students benefitted the most from academically homogeneous groups. Results for the one full semester of the study and the rationale for discontinuing are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Mentorship plays an essential role in enhancing the success of junior faculty. Previous evaluation tools focused on specific types of mentors or mentees. The main objective was to develop and provide validity evidence for a Mentor Evaluation Tool (MET) to assess the effectiveness of one-on-one mentoring for faculty in the academic health sciences. Methods: Evidence was collected for the validity domains of content, internal structure and relationship to other variables. The 13 item MET was tested for internal structure evidence with 185 junior faculty from Schools of Dentistry, Medicine, Nursing, and Pharmacy. Finally, the MET was studied for additional validity evidence by prospectively enrolling mentees of three different groups of faculty (faculty nominated for, or winners of, a lifetime achievement in mentoring award; faculty graduates of a mentor training program; and faculty mentors not in either of the other two groups) at the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) and asking them to rate their mentors using the MET. Mentors and mentees were clinicians, educators and/or researchers. Results: The 13 MET items mapped well to the five mentoring domains and six competencies described in the literature. The standardized Cronbach's coefficient alpha was 0.96. Confirmatory factor analysis supported a single factor (CFI = 0.89, SRMR = 0.05). The three mentor groups did not differ in the single overall assessment item (P = 0.054) or mean MET score (P = 0.288), before or after adjusting for years of mentoring. The mentorship score means were relatively high for all three groups. Conclusions: The Mentor Evaluation Tool demonstrates evidence of validity for research, clinical, educational or career mentors in academic health science careers. However, MET did not distinguish individuals nominated as outstanding mentors from other mentors. MET validity evidence can be studied further with mentor-mentee pairs and to follow prospectively the rating of mentors before and after a mentorship training program. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As a scientific field, scientific mapping offers a set of standardized methods and tools which can be consistently adopted by researchers in different knowledge domains to answer their own research questions. This study examined the scientific articles that applied science mapping tools (SMT) to analyze scientific domains and the citations of these application articles. To understand the roles of these application articles in scholarly communication, we analyzed 496 application articles and their citations from 14 SMT by classifying them into library and information science (LIS) and other fields (non-LIS) in terms of both publication venues and analyzed domains. In our study, we found that science mapping, a topic that is deeply situated in the LIS field, has gained increasing attention from various non-LIS scientific fields over the last few years, especially since 2012. Science mapping application studies practically grew up in LIS domain and spread to other fields. The application articles within and outside of the LIS fields played different roles in advancing the application of science mapping and knowledge discovery. Especially, we have discovered the important role of articles, which studied non-LIS domains but published in LIS journals, in advancing the application of SMTs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today's schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants' correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and aims: Since its emergence in the mid‐20th century, invasion biology has matured into a productive research field addressing questions of fundamental and applied importance. Not only has the number of empirical studies increased through time, but also has the number of competing, overlapping and, in some cases, contradictory hypotheses about biological invasions. To make these contradictions and redundancies explicit, and to gain insight into the field's current theoretical structure, we developed and applied a Delphi approach to create a consensus network of 39 existing invasion hypotheses. Results: The resulting network was analysed with a link‐clustering algorithm that revealed five concept clusters (resource availability, biotic interaction, propagule, trait and Darwin's clusters) representing complementary areas in the theory of invasion biology. The network also displays hypotheses that link two or more clusters, called connecting hypotheses, which are important in determining network structure. The network indicates hypotheses that are logically linked either positively (77 connections of support) or negatively (that is, they contradict each other; 6 connections). Significance: The network visually synthesizes how invasion biology's predominant hypotheses are conceptually related to each other, and thus, reveals an emergent structure – a conceptual map – that can serve as a navigation tool for scholars, practitioners and students, both inside and outside of the field of invasion biology, and guide the development of a more coherent foundation of theory. Additionally, the outlined approach can be more widely applied to create a conceptual map for the larger fields of ecology and biogeography. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Literature describing the effectiveness of teaching strategies in the clinical setting is limited. This realist synthesis review focuses on understanding the effectiveness of teaching strategies used in the clinical setting. Methods: We searched ten databases for English language publications between 1 January 1970 and 31 May 2017 reporting effective teaching strategies, used in a clinical setting, of non-procedural skills. After screening, we used consensus to determine inclusion and employed a standardised instrument to capture study populations, methodology, and outcomes. We summarised what strategies worked, for whom, and in what settings. Results: The initial search netted 53,642 references after de-duplication; 2037 were retained after title and abstract review. Full text review was done on 82 references, with ultimate inclusion of 25 publications. Three specific teaching strategies demonstrated impact on educational outcomes: the One Minute Preceptor (OMP), SNAPPS, and concept mapping. Most of the literature involves physician trainees in an ambulatory environment. All three have been shown to improve skills in the domains of medical knowledge and clinical reasoning. Discussion/conclusions: Apart from the OMP, SNAPPS, and concept mapping, which target the formation of clinical knowledge and reasoning skills, the literature establishing effective teaching strategies in the clinical setting is sparse.

AB  - Background: Mentoring's success in enhancing a mentee's professional and personal development, and a host organisations' reputation has been called into question, amidst a lack of effective tools to evaluate mentoring relationships and guide oversight of mentoring programs. A scoping review is proposed to map available literature on mentoring assessment tools in Internal Medicine to guide design of new tools. Objective: The review aims to explore how novice mentoring is assessed in Internal Medicine, including the domains assessed, and the strengths and limitations of the assessment methods. Methods: Guided by Levac et al.'s framework for scoping reviews, 12 reviewers conducted independent literature reviews of assessment tools in novice mentoring in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, ERIC, Cochrane, GreyLit, Web of Science, Open Dissertations and British Education Index databases. A 'split approach' saw research members adopting either Braun and Clarke's approach to thematic analysis or directed content analysis to independently evaluate the data and improve validity and objectivity of the findings. Results: 9662 abstracts were identified, 187 full-text articles reviewed, and 54 full-text articles included. There was consensus on the themes and categories identified through the use of the split approach, which were the domains assessed and methods of assessment. Conclusion: Most tools fail to contend with mentoring's evolving nature and provide mere snap shots of the mentoring process largely from the mentee's perspective. The lack of holistic, longitudinal and validated assessments propagate fears that ethical issues in mentoring are poorly recognized and addressed. To this end, we forward a framework for the design of 'fit for purpose' multi-dimensional tools. Practice points: Most tools focus on the mentee's perspective, do not consider mentoring's evolving nature and fail to consider mentoring holistically nor longitudinally A new tool capable of addressing these gaps must also consider inputs from all stakeholders and take a longitudinal perspective of mentoring [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles of non-relativistic theory. The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of undergraduate textbooks, and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties. The answer consists of seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed to account for the results of measurement and time evolution. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets of the interplay between the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables, and to highlight the educational significance of the relations between observables. The maps can be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure and by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While this framework may be adapted to different approaches and interpretive stances, it provides indications in favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The literature indicates that the use of mobile devices, wireless communication and sensing techniques can enhance students' learning in authentic environments and improve their learning effectiveness. Good learning strategy guides are essential for successful inquiry learning, and the question-posing strategy has been acknowledged as a type of high-level cognitive strategy that plays an important role in facilitating students' knowledge integration in the inquiry learning process. However, question posing seems challenging for many students and may lead to heavy cognitive load when appropriate scaffolding is not available. To solve this problem, the present research imported a concept mapping knowledge representation model as an auxiliary strategy for question-posing activities based on the research finding that visual knowledge representations are conducive to high-order thinking. It also developed a ubiquitous learning system which integrated multilevel concept mapping and question-posing strategy guidance to investigate the application effects of this learning model. A quasi-experimental design was applied, and an experiment was conducted to measure 5th graders' learning of a plant unit of the natural science curriculum. Students in the experimental group learned with the proposed ubiquitous learning system based on the multilevel concept mapping and question-posing approach, while those in the control group learned with the ubiquitous learning system based on the question-posing approach. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group from the perspectives of learning achievement and question-posing performance, but no significance was found in their cognitive load, meta-cognitive awareness, and science learning strategies. • The concept mapping-based question-posing approach promotes effective learning. • The concept mapping-based question-posing approach lowers cognitive load. • The concept mapping-based question-posing approach motivates learning. • Scaffolding question posing with concept mapping increases question-posing quality.

AB  - The study investigates the effect of an interactive simulation with embedded inquiry support, which was seamlessly embedded within the simulation, on students' scientific literacy and school science achievement, and explores the relationships among prior school science achievement, inquiry processes and scientific literacy. A total of 49 eighth-grade students at a public junior high school in northern Taiwan participated. Data collected include the students' pre- and post-scores for school science achievement, logging data that indicate their inquiry processes, and pretest, posttest, and delayed-test data that measure their scientific literacy. The results provide evidence that the designed simulation and inquiry support had a long-term effect on the students' scientific literacy. Replacing conventional teaching with inquiry activities did not harm the students' school science achievement performances. Moreover, compared to school science achievement, students' scientific literacy seems a better predictor of their inquiry behavior, especially in the aspect of making conclusions. Analyses of the students' inquiry processes indicate that the so-called low science achieving students conducted more data analyses than the other students, and demonstrated adequate inquiry engagement. The students with middle level school science achievement demonstrated the most active engagement in inquiry and showed good gains of scientific literacy after the learning. These results indicate that a guided inquiry learning environment can support students with different levels of school science achievement to highly engage in science inquiry. Implications and future studies are discussed. • The designed simulation and embedded inquiry support had a long-term effect on the students' scientific literacy. • Compared to school science achievement, students' scientific literacy seems a better predictor of their inquiry behavior. • The low science achieving students conducted more data analyses and demonstrated adequate inquiry engagement. • The middle-level achieving students demonstrated the most active engagement in inquiry and gains of scientific literacy.

AB  - Using findings from a 4‐year research and development effort, we propose an updated model of sheltered instruction for science classrooms that leverages the opportunities provided by the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) to better support multilingual learners in middle and high school science. Using data from teacher implementation logs and interviews, we examine how secondary grades science teachers' participation in our professional learning framework and subsequent enactments of an initial set of project instructional practices led these teachers to articulate nuanced and strategic adaptations to the initial practices to better meet the needs of the multilingual learners in their classrooms. We found that teachers moved away from implementing sheltered instruction practices based on general principles or formal classifications, such as students' English language proficiency level, instead taking a more nuanced approach to adopting, adapting and rejecting practices based on perceived needs, assets, and personal knowledge about individual multilingual students in the specific disciplinary context of science. Based on this analysis, we conceptualize and refine what we now see as a new and exploratory set of Next Generation Sheltered Instruction practices for integrating science and language to support multilingual learners in secondary science classrooms in the age of the NGSS.

AB  - Knowledge discovery from omics data has become a common goal of current approaches to personalised cancer medicine and understanding cancer genotype and phenotype. However, high-throughput biomedical datasets are characterised by high dimensionality and relatively small sample sizes with small signal-to-noise ratios. Extracting and interpreting relevant knowledge from such complex datasets therefore remains a significant challenge for the fields of machine learning and data mining. In this paper, we exploit recent advances in deep learning to mitigate against these limitations on the basis of automatically capturing enough of the meaningful abstractions latent with the available biological samples. Our deep feature learning model is proposed based on a set of non-linear sparse Auto-Encoders that are deliberately constructed in an under-complete manner to detect a small proportion of molecules that can recover a large proportion of variations underlying the data. However, since multiple projections are applied to the input signals, it is hard to interpret which phenotypes were responsible for deriving such predictions. Therefore, we also introduce a novel weight interpretation technique that helps to deconstruct the internal state of such deep learning models to reveal key determinants underlying its latent representations. The outcomes of our experiment provide strong evidence that the proposed deep mining model is able to discover robust biomarkers that are positively and negatively associated with cancers of interest. Since our deep mining model is problem-independent and data-driven, it provides further potential for this research to extend beyond its cognate disciplines. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The relapse risk prediction for children with Henoch-Schönlein purpura can help pediatricians make an accurate prognosis and offer personalized and appropriate follow-up nursing and relapse control to patients. In this study, we propose a Genetic algorithm- Support vector machine (GA-SVM) learning method combining the support vector machine with the genetic algorithm for parameter optimization to capture the nonlinear mapping from a panel of biomarkers to the relapse risk of HSP children. The GA-SVM prediction model is created by using the dataset of 40 samples in clinical treatment and observation of patients. The inputs of the model consist of 19 biomarkers including gender, age, immunoglobulin M, immunoglobulin G, immunoglobulin A, prothrombin time, etc. The outputs consist of 1 and -1, where 1 indicates high relapse risk and -1 indicates low relapse risk. For comparison, the GS-SVM prediction model based on parameter optimization of grid search is also created. The experimental results show that the GA-SVM prediction model has a high prediction accuracy of 90% and is strong in generalization ability. The GA-SVM model for predicting the relapse risk of HSP children is a promising decision support tool of clinical prognosis, which provides pediatricians with valuable assistance to offer rehabilitation treatment to patients.

AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal – by using the concept mapping tool – the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students' concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - We studied the initial conceptions of 73 pre-service primary teachers regarding the concept of ecosystem and examined how their understanding evolved as a result of participation in an inquiry-based learning exercise. The inquiry process involved identifying students' initial conceptions, making them aware of these, comparison of their ideas with scientific knowledge and knowledge building through activities in which they analysed points of agreement, discrepancies and conclusions. The activities were performed in groups and centred on the production of posters, which participants were required to compare in both the first and final sessions. This comparison, together with the qualitative analysis of the content of the posters, was carried out using a rubric designed on the basis of a literature review. The results showed that students progressed in their understanding of key aspects related to the concept of ecosystem. In particular, they became more aware of the role that humans play within such systems, although they continued to have difficulties with aspects such as identifying species in the aquatic ecosystem and discriminating between biotic and abiotic components.

AB  - Using problems from real life contexts which is related to learners' environment or their culture plays an important role in their learning that concept. In this regard, science educators especially physics educators search for real-life domain of theoretical concepts for effective science teaching and they consider analogical and physical models as an opportunity in their instruction. In the presented activity, we worked with 66 senior pre-service science teachers from our science teaching methods course. We used crowd movements as a real-life domain of our analogical models to scientifically explain a stampede case, then utilized physical model to explore continuity equation. Real life problem based scenarios could be used while taking advantage of the 3 D modeling in teaching of scientific principle. As a result, we found that pre-service teachers were able to make scientific explanation for causes of stampedes by using modeling activity. High school teachers and upper-level instructors could benefit from including the modeling activity introduced in this study to help their students understand the concepts related to continuity equation by designing a physical model based on an analogical model. Via the physical model, students are able to make predictions, observations, interpretations and explanations of a complex and abstract scientific phenomenon. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Remote sensing, or Earth Observation (EO), is increasingly used to understand Earth system dynamics and create continuous and categorical maps of biophysical properties and land cover, especially based on recent advances in machine learning (ML). ML models typically require large, spatially explicit training datasets to make accurate predictions. Training data (TD) are typically generated by digitizing polygons on high spatial-resolution imagery, by collecting in situ data, or by using pre-existing datasets. TD are often assumed to accurately represent the truth, but in practice almost always have error, stemming from (1) sample design, and (2) sample collection errors. The latter is particularly relevant for image-interpreted TD, an increasingly commonly used method due to its practicality and the increasing training sample size requirements of modern ML algorithms. TD errors can cause substantial errors in the maps created using ML algorithms, which may impact map use and interpretation. Despite these potential errors and their real-world consequences for map-based decisions, TD error is often not accounted for or reported in EO research. Here we review the current practices for collecting and handling TD. We identify the sources of TD error, and illustrate their impacts using several case studies representing different EO applications (infrastructure mapping, global surface flux estimates, and agricultural monitoring), and provide guidelines for minimizing and accounting for TD errors. To harmonize terminology, we distinguish TD from three other classes of data that should be used to create and assess ML models: training reference data, used to assess the quality of TD during data generation; validation data, used to iteratively improve models; and map reference data, used only for final accuracy assessment. We focus primarily on TD, but our advice is generally applicable to all four classes, and we ground our review in established best practices for map accuracy assessment literature. EO researchers should start by determining the tolerable levels of map error and appropriate error metrics. Next, TD error should be minimized during sample design by choosing a representative spatio-temporal collection strategy, by using spatially and temporally relevant imagery and ancillary data sources during TD creation, and by selecting a set of legend definitions supported by the data. Furthermore, TD error can be minimized during the collection of individual samples by using consensus-based collection strategies, by directly comparing interpreted training observations against expert-generated training reference data to derive TD error metrics, and by providing image interpreters with thorough application-specific training. We strongly advise that TD error is incorporated in model outputs, either directly in bias and variance estimates or, at a minimum, by documenting the sources and implications of error. TD should be fully documented and made available via an open TD repository, allowing others to replicate and assess its use. To guide researchers in this process, we propose three tiers of TD error accounting standards. Finally, we advise researchers to clearly communicate the magnitude and impacts of TD error on map outputs, with specific consideration given to the likely map audience. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Spatial modelling of storm dust provenance is essential to mitigate its on-site and off-site effects in the arid and semi-arid environments of the world. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to apply eight data mining algorithms including random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), bayesian additive regression trees (BART), radial basis function (RBF), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), regression tree analysis (RTA), Cubist model and boosted regression trees (BRT) and an ensemble modelling (EM) approach for generating spatial maps of dust provenance in the Khuzestan province, a main region with active sources for producing dust in southwestern Iran. This study is the first attempt at predicting storm dust provenance by applying individual data mining models and ensemble modelling. We identified and mapped in a geographic information system (GIS), 12 potential effective factors for dust emissions comprising two for climate (wind speed, precipitation), five soil characteristics (texture, bulk density, Ec, organic matter (OM), available water capacity (AWC)), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land use, geology, a digital elevation model (DEM) and land type, and used a mean decrease accuracy measure (MDAM) to determine the corresponding importance scores (IS). A multicollinearity test (including the variance inflation factor (VIF) and tolerance coefficient (TC)) was applied to assess relationships between the effective factors, and an existing map of dust provenance was randomly categorized into two groups consisting of training (70%) and validation (30%) data. The individual data mining models were validated using the area under the curve (AUC). Based on the TC and VIF results, no collinearity was detected among the 12 effective factors for dust emissions. The prediction accuracies of the eight data mining models and an EM assessed by the AUC were as follows: EM (with AUC = 99.8%) > XGBoost > RBF > Cubist > RF > BART > SVM > BRT > RTA (with AUC = 79.1%). Among all models, the EM was found to provide the highest accuracy for predicting storm dust provenance. Using the EM, areas classified as being low, moderate, high and very high susceptibility for storm dust provenance comprised 36, 13, 23 and 28% of the total mapped area, respectively. Based on MDAM results, the highest and lowest IS were obtained for the wind speed (IS = 23) and geology (IS = 6.5) factors, respectively. Overall, the modelling techniques used in this research are helpful for predicting storm dust provenance and thereby targeting mitigation. Therefore, we recommend applying data mining EM approaches to the spatial mapping of storm dust provenance worldwide. Unlabelled Image • Data mining algorithms and ensemble modelling used to map dust provenance spatially. • Mean decrease accuracy measure used to determine importance scores for the controls. • Ensemble model provided the highest accuracy for predicting storm dust provenance. • Techniques used are helpful for targeting mitigation.

AB  - In this work we reduce undersampling artefacts in two-dimensional (2D) golden-angle radial cine cardiac MRI by applying a modified version of the U-net. The network is trained on 2D spatio-temporal slices which are previously extracted from the image sequences. We compare our approach to two 2D and a 3D deep learning-based post processing methods, three iterative reconstruction methods and two recently proposed methods for dynamic cardiac MRI based on 2D and 3D cascaded networks. Our method outperforms the 2D spatially trained U-net and the 2D spatio-temporal U-net. Compared to the 3D spatio-temporal U-net, our method delivers comparable results, but requiring shorter training times and less training data. Compared to the compressed sensing-based methods kt-FOCUSS and a total variation regularized reconstruction approach, our method improves image quality with respect to all reported metrics. Further, it achieves competitive results when compared to the iterative reconstruction method based on adaptive regularization with dictionary learning and total variation and when compared to the methods based on cascaded networks, while only requiring a small fraction of the computational and training time. A persistent homology analysis demonstrates that the data manifold of the spatio-temporal domain has a lower complexity than the one of the spatial domain and therefore, the learning of a projection-like mapping is facilitated. Even when trained on only one single subject without data-augmentation, our approach yields results which are similar to the ones obtained on a large training dataset. This makes the method particularly suitable for training a network on limited training data. Finally, in contrast to the spatial 2D U-net, our proposed method is shown to be naturally robust with respect to image rotation in image space and almost achieves rotation-equivariance where neither data-augmentation nor a particular network design are required.

AB  - This paper proposes a fast support vector machine (SVM) training method for the classification of very large datasets using data reconstruction. The idea is to scale down the training data by removing the samples that have low probability to become support vectors (SVs) in the feature space. For this purpose, it applies a series of gradually refined rough SVM classifiers with a quasi‐linear kernel to build rough separation boundaries and remove those samples that are far away from the boundary. In order to make the proposed algorithm efficient for both low‐dimensional and high‐dimensional datasets, efforts are made on three aspects. The first one is to compose a quasi‐linear kernel using the information of data manifold and potential separation boundary such that the samples mapped to feature space keep a sparse distribution, especially in the direction perpendicular to the separation boundary. The second one is to avoid computing Euclidean distances between samples, which may lose its effect on very high dimensional datasets when mapping the samples to feature space and selecting the samples for training data reconstruction. The third one is to design a sophisticated iterative algorithm to gradually refine the rough SVM classifier so as to remove non‐SVs efficiently. The proposed fast SVM training method is applied to different real‐world large datasets and compared with different methods, and simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method, especially for very high dimensional datasets. © 2019 Institute of Electrical Engineers of Japan.

AB  - Most people are using their smartphones daily and carry them all the time. Therefore, mobile learning applications can be integrated in daily routines to make learning a part of daily life. While numerous mobile learning applications exist, each with their own goal, our aim was to explore the possibility of creating an engaging mobile environment that could be useful for informal learning, as well as for other forms of learning, i.e., non-formal and formal learning. The result is TICKLE, a playful learning environment for youngsters. It is a mobile location-based smartphone application that offers youngsters an interactive environment for exploring their surroundings. It offers cards related to physical locations, which can be collected by performing small challenges (based on the principles of micro learning). A design science research approach has been used to develop this software environment. Persuasive techniques and gamification are used to stimulate usage. Furthermore, a personalized approach is applied. The environment was evaluated by means of formative evaluations in different contexts. We obtained positive results and received useful feedback to improve and extend the application. We can conclude that, in the context of these evaluations, the app was usable for youngsters and able to engage them, and we see indications that it may be able to increase the intrinsic motivation and learning capacity of youngsters. In addition, our demonstrations show that the app is usable in different contexts and for different purposes. In this way, the environment can be used to offer youngsters appealing learning related experiences. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A major challenge in modelling and simulation is the need to combine expertise in both software technologies and a given scientific domain. When High-Performance Computing (HPC) is required to solve a scientific problem, software development becomes a problematic issue. Considering the complexity of the software for HPC, it is useful to identify programming languages that can be used to alleviate this issue. Because the existing literature on the topic of HPC is very dispersed, we performed a Systematic Mapping Study (SMS) in the context of the European COST Action cHiPSet. This literature study maps characteristics of various programming languages for data-intensive HPC applications, including category, typical user profiles, effectiveness, and type of articles. We organised the SMS in two phases. In the first phase, relevant articles are identified employing an automated keyword-based search in eight digital libraries. This lead to an initial sample of 420 papers, which was then narrowed down in a second phase by human inspection of article abstracts, titles and keywords to 152 relevant articles published in the period 2006–2018. The analysis of these articles enabled us to identify 26 programming languages referred to in 33 of relevant articles. We compared the outcome of the mapping study with results of our questionnaire-based survey that involved 57 HPC experts. The mapping study and the survey revealed that the desired features of programming languages for data-intensive HPC applications are portability, performance and usability. Furthermore, we observed that the majority of the programming languages used in the context of data-intensive HPC applications are text-based general-purpose programming languages. Typically these have a steep learning curve, which makes them difficult to adopt. We believe that the outcome of this study will inspire future research and development in programming languages for data-intensive HPC applications. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A key challenge in the field of cognitive neuroscience is to identify discriminable cognitive functions, and then map these functions to brain activity. In the current study, we set out to explore the relationships between performance arising from different cognitive tasks thought to tap different domains of cognition, and then to test whether these distinct latent cognitive abilities also are subserved by corresponding "latent" brain substrates. To this end, we tested a large sample of adults under the age of 40 on twelve cognitive tasks as they underwent fMRI scanning. Exploratory factor analysis revealed 4-factor model, dissociating tasks into processes corresponding to episodic memory retrieval, reasoning, speed of processing and vocabulary. An analysis of the topographic covariance patterns of the BOLD-response acquired during each task similarity also converged on four neural networks that corresponded to the 4 latent factors. These results suggest that distinct ontologies of cognition are subserved by corresponding distinct neural networks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identify genetic variants associated with traits or diseases. GWAS never directly link variants to regulatory mechanisms. Instead, the functional annotation of variants is typically inferred by post hoc analyses. A specific class of deep learning-based methods allows for the prediction of regulatory effects per variant on several cell type-specific chromatin features. We here describe "DeepWAS", a new approach that integrates these regulatory effect predictions of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. Thereby, single variants associated with a trait or disease are directly coupled to their impact on a chromatin feature in a cell type. Up to 61 regulatory SNPs, called dSNPs, were associated with multiple sclerosis (MS, 4,888 cases and 10,395 controls), major depressive disorder (MDD, 1,475 cases and 2,144 controls), and height (5,974 individuals). These variants were mainly non-coding and reached at least nominal significance in classical GWAS. The prediction accuracy was higher for DeepWAS than for classical GWAS models for 91% of the genome-wide significant, MS-specific dSNPs. DSNPs were enriched in public or cohort-matched expression and methylation quantitative trait loci and we demonstrated the potential of DeepWAS to generate testable functional hypotheses based on genotype data alone. DeepWAS is available at https://github.com/cellmapslab/DeepWAS. Author summary: In the era of steadily increasing amounts of available genetic data, we still lack novel and innovative ideas on how to improve fine-mapping of regulatory variants identified by genome-wide association studies (GWAS), especially in non-coding regions. Current approaches for the identification of functional variants conduct functional annotation after the GWAS analysis either using position-based overlaps of each variant with regulatory elements or deep-learning-based methods predicting regulatory effects per variant on cell-type-specific chromatin features. We here present DeepWAS, which integrates these regulatory effect predictions of single variants into a multivariate GWAS setting. Our results provide evidence that DeepWAS results directly identify disease/trait-associated SNPs with a common effect on a specific chromatin feature in a relevant tissue. We can show for multiple sclerosis, major depressive disorder, and body height, that the SNPs identified by DeepWAS are at least nominally significant in classical univariate GWAS analysis of the same cohorts or larger published GWAS. By integrating expression and methylation quantitative trait loci (eQTL and meQTL) information of multiple resources and tissues, we can show that DeepWAS identifies disease/trait-relevant transcriptionally active genomic loci. We demonstrate that DeepWAS identifies both known variants and highlights underlying molecular mechanisms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examines the effects of different simulation interface designs on students' conceptual understanding of optical imaging and mental model development, and clarifies these design implications on students' behavioral performance and average residence time. We developed simulations of two different interfaces—gesture- and mouse-based simulations—to collect and compare data from two respective student groups. We utilized a quasi-experimental design, and selected and assigned 64 sixth-grade students to the gesture-and mouse-based simulation groups. The results showed a significant difference between the mental model tests (MMT) of the two groups. Specifically, among the three aspects of a mental model, answer (phenomenon) and explanations (which explain the phenomenon) showed more significant differences with the use of gesture-based than mouse-based simulations. The multivariate analysis of variance results indicated that students using gesture-based simulations demonstrated a longer average residence time than those using mouse-based simulations. Further, the study results suggest that compared to a traditional mouse-based interface, the application of multi-touch gestures in optical imaging concept learning enabled not only the development of a more complete mental model but also the improvement of students' science explanation skills. • Mouse- and gesture-based simulations significantly enhanced conceptual learning. • Complete mental models could be created with multi-touch gesture-based simulations. • Multi-touch gesture-based simulation improved students' science explanation skills.

AB  - For learners to be successful in an information problem solving task, they should be able to effectively regulate their own behaviour. Despite views that such behaviour may come naturally to an individual, research generally shows that some learners do experience problems with information problem solving that may stem from such things as limited prior knowledge. As a means of addressing this challenge, the authors explored how the provision of both a concept map and search tool could overcome barriers to effective information problem solving. This was explored in the current study using data collected from 111 undergraduate students who completed an information problem solving activity, wherein a concept map and search tool were provided to help them write two short essays. Through the use of event-sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, two information problem solving strategy groups were identified (High Engagement and Low Engagement), which differed across time-on-task and essay grades. Additional analyses were undertaken to explore self-reported prior knowledge or motivation as predictors of group assignment. The findings show that even when presented with opportunities (i.e., concept map) to support effective information problem solving, not all learners will take advantage or glean the benefits of such tools. Trace data methodology is shown to be a promising approach to explore information problem solving behaviour that can overcome the limitations of solely relying upon self-report measures. • Engaging in information problem solving is important to learners throughout educational and workplace settings. • Identification of discernible patterns of information problem solving whilst using keyword searches and a concept map. • High engagement learners in an information problem solving task were more successful based on essay grades. • Information problem solving behaviour not associated with self-reported levels of prior knowledge.

AB  - Background: Many articles described that concept mapping can be used as a useful tool for education, especially in science. It has been found that the primary grade children are capable of making the concept maps and can explain their work to others. Concept mapping plays a key role in the educational point of view. Concept maps improve classroom teaching and learning. Concept maps have been used by the authors of the recent BSCS (1990) blue version high school science text, biological science: A molecular approach, for both planning and writing the book. Materials and Methods: A survey was conducted among 2nd year Bachelor of Dental Surgery Students of Saveetha Dental College. A comprehensive questionnaire was prepared which consisted of 14 questions and distributed through survey planet. A hundred responses were received and the collected data were calculated with statistics. Results and Discussion: Concept maps improve academic performance in problem-solving questions and students' perception about the effectiveness of concept maps was overwhelmingly positive. For a 3% student, it takes more time as for some people concept map is a very difficult task, confusing, and needs more time. In our study, it shows 97% of students utilize less time to recollect all the points during exams. Conclusion: It can be concluded that the concept map can be a better option for understanding the pathology concept. It boosts the performance of the examinations in the pathology course. It is a powerful tool in learning and replaces long essays. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Meaningful learning occurs by relating new information to and revising prior knowledge, making it essential to understand student knowledge before helping them move toward a more scientific understanding. In this study, we characterise prior knowledge about cellular respiration in undergraduate students enrolled in introductory biology by analysing student-constructed concept maps (N = 182) and interviews (N = 9). Students were instructed to create concept maps from a bank of 20 concepts with the purpose of interconnecting the processes of cellular respiration, showing how pools of ATP are generated and used, and identifying where the events of cellular respiration occur. Student maps were analysed for content, quality and organisation of knowledge. Interviews were used to corroborate inferences made from concept maps. Students had a simplified understanding of cellular respiration and its processes as evident by cognitive structures with limited quantities of schemas that were vaguely connected and linearly organised. Furthermore, students had a better understanding of glycolysis than fermentation. Instructors can use these findings to help students build better knowledge of cellular respiration by focusing on incorporating relevant schemas, creating quality connections among schemas, and organising their knowledge of cellular respiration to reflect biological complexity.

AB  - • Robust connectomic feature selection via brain network atlas estimation. • NAG-FS is a network atlas-based connectomic feature selection method. • NAG-FS fingerprints neurological disorders. • Brain connectivity biomarker discovery in neurological disorders. Image-based brain maps, generally coined as 'intensity or image atlases', have led the field of brain mapping in health and disease for decades, while investigating a wide spectrum of neurological disorders. Estimating representative brain atlases constitute a fundamental step in several MRI-based neurological disorder mapping, diagnosis, and prognosis. However, these are strikingly lacking in the field of brain connectomics, where connectional brain atlases derived from functional MRI (fRMI) or diffusion MRI (dMRI) are almost absent. On the other hand, conventional connectomic-based classification methods traditionally resort to feature selection methods to decrease the high-dimensionality of connectomic data for learning how to diagnose new patients. However, these are generally limited by high computational cost and a large variability in performance across different datasets, which might hinder the identification of reproducible biomarkers. To address both limitations, we unprecedentedly propose a brain network atlas-guided feature selection (NAG-FS) method to disentangle the healthy from the disordered connectome. To this aim, given a population of brain connectomes, we propose to learn how estimate a centered and representative functional brain network atlas (i.e., a population center) to reliably map the functional connectome and its variability across training individuals, thereby capturing their shared traits (i.e., connectional fingerprint of a population). Essentially, we first learn the pairwise similarities between connectomes in the population to map them into different subspaces. Next, we non-linearly diffuse and fuse connectomes living in each subspace, respectively. By integrating the produced subspace-specific network atlases we ultimately estimate the population network atlas. Last, we compute the difference between healthy and disordered network atlases to identify the most discriminative features, which are then used to train a predictive learner. Our method boosted the classification performance by 6% in comparison to state-of-the-art FS methods when classifying autistic and healthy subjects. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Like some other countries, seldom being sometimes addressed in classes, the Earth system approach is not emphasized enough in Portugal, nor is the interconnection between the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. To evaluate the Earth system holistic view of a group of 8th grade (13–15 years old) Portuguese students from a public school of the north of Portugal, an improved conceptual map-based to approach Earth system was investigated. After learning about concept mapping, students were asked to collaborate in the production of four conceptual maps regarding each one of the geochemical and biogeochemical cycles, further combining these maps in a common one. Through teamwork-based task, each group was asked to establish relations between the cycles, integrated into each one of the four Earth subsystems. The final combined maps demonstrated that, in the first phase, students had some difficulties in completing the pre-designed improved maps, being more evident in the rock cycle. Contrarily, the food chain cycle revealed fewer mistakes and more appropriate terms were added. In the second phase, the students exhibited difficulties in relating the cycles to the four subsystems and the remaining cycles, drawing many arrows without any kind of connecting words. Nevertheless, in general, students have realized how to build an improved concept map but do not possess a holistic view of the Earth system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the overall effectiveness of the flipped classroom on students' learning achievement and motivation. Data were collected from three databases, which include Web of Science, Scopus, and Eric. The present meta-analysis synthesized the findings of 95 studies with 15386 participants published from 2013 to 2019. The results revealed that the flipped classroom approach had a moderate effect size for learning achievement and learning motivation. The effect sizes of 12 moderators, including sample level, sample size, learning domain, the flip classroom model, research design, intervention duration, teaching method in the class, sample region, interactions in a pre-class and face-to-face class, tools in pre-class, and resources in pre-class were also analyzed. The results indicated that sample size, intervention durations, and sample regions significantly moderated the effect sizes. The findings of this study are discussed in-depth, together with the implications for practices on the use of the flipped classroom approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The national project Trinity of Languages announced in Kazakhstan has brought forward multilingual education throughout the country. The project requires the implementation of rigorous learning tools to master the Kazakh, Russian and English languages within trilingualism. An e-dictionary to be used in content and language integrated learning is among modern e-tools promoted in a trilingual school environment. A user-friendly biological e-dictionary will help high school learners grasp fundamental concepts in natural sciences. The article aims to describe how to analyze and systemize the lexicographic material selected for developing a trilingual e-dictionary of biological terms for Kazakhstani school learners. Determining sources of vocabulary chosen was based upon a linguocultural approach, which highlights the cultural aspect embodied in the language, and mind-mapping, which allows deconstructing complex topics graphically. Twenty-eight items were selected to cover the biology school course, which was later analyzed and systemized to consistently present generic and species features via mind-mapping. Then organic unification of the items and compositional parameters of the e-dictionary were determined. The obtained findings show that a linguocultural component is embedded in a trilingual e-dictionary of biological terms that are taken from relevant Kazakh and Russian school textbooks (grades 6-11). The selected items are classified and subject to linguocultural analysis in conceptual groups which may show phytonyms and zoonima. The items are supplied with an adequate linguocultural commentary taken from English-language reference books and websites. The conceptual groups and linguistic analysis are displayed via the mind map Coggle used for the e-dictionary frame formation. The proposed linguocultural component embedded in the edictionary is rare in other existing trilingual e-dictionaries since they focus primarily on lexicographic material and their visual representation. Overall, the trilingual e-dictionary created in mind-mapping software is an effective etool for high school learners to study biological terms with their linguocultural commentaries.

AB  - O projeto nacional Trinity of Languages anunciado no Cazaquistão promoveu a educação multilíngue em todo o país. O projeto requer a implementação de ferramentas rigorosas de aprendizado para dominar os idiomas cazaque, russo e inglês no trilinguismo. Um dicionário eletrônico para ser usado no aprendizado integrado de conteúdo e idioma está entre as modernas ferramentas eletrônicas promovidas em um ambiente escolar trilíngue. Um dicionário eletrônico biológico fácil de usar ajudará os alunos do ensino médio a compreender conceitos básicos nas ciências naturais. O artigo tem como objetivo descrever como analisar e sistematizar o material lexicográfico selecionado para o desenvolvimento de um dicionário eletrônico trilíngue de termos biológicos para os alunos das escolas do Cazaquistão. A determinação das fontes do vocabulário selecionado foi baseada em uma abordagem línguo-cultural, que destaca o aspecto cultural incorporado na língua, e o mapeamento mental, que permite desconstruir graficamente tópicos complexos. Vinte e oito itens foram selecionados para cobrir o curso da escola de biologia, que foram posteriormente analisados e sistematizados para apresentar consistentemente características genéricas e de espécies através do mapeamento mental. Em seguida, a unificação orgânica dos itens e os parâmetros de composição do e-dicionário foram determinados. As descobertas obtidas mostraram que um componente linguístico é incorporado em um dicionário eletrônico trilíngue de termos biológicos, retirados dos livros didáticos relevantes das escolas cazaque e russa (notas 6 a 11). Os itens selecionados são classificados e sujeitos à análise línguo-cultural em grupos conceituais que podem mostrar phytonyms e zoonima. Os itens são fornecidos com um comentário linguístico-cultural adequado, retirado de livros e sites de referência em inglês. Os grupos conceituais e comentários linguísticos são exibidos no mapa mental Coggle usado para a formação de quadros do dicionário eletrônico. O componente línguo-cultural proposto incorporado no dicionário eletrônico é raro em outros dicionários eletrônicos trilíngues existentes, pois se concentra principalmente no material lexicográfico e em sua representação visual. No geral, o dicionário eletrônico trilíngue criado no software de mapeamento mental é uma ferramenta eletrônica eficaz para os alunos do ensino médio estudarem termos biológicos com seus comentários linguísticos.

AB  - This study tested the effect of cooperative concept mapping on knowledge achievement and transfer in peace education on 159 social studies students using a quasi-experimental research design. Four intact classes—two each in rural and urban areas—were randomly assigned to experimental and control conditions, and two instruments—Peace Education Achievement Test and Peace Education Transferability Test—were used for data collection. Findings showed that cooperative concept mapping unveiled students' misconceptions in peace education and their perceptions about violent behaviors, raised students' consciousness about asymmetric structures undermining peace, empowered them with ability to establish connections between intrinsic and extrinsic causes of conflict, and encouraged practical suggestions on how to resolve conflict and promote peace through enactment of peace virtues. Bivariate associations showed that students' achievement in one context correlated with their transfer of learning in another context, with stronger correlation exhibited among experimental students. We attributed the stronger correlation recorded among experimental students to the "concepts connection" and visual effect occasioned by concept maps and overt effort of experimental teachers to create cooperative, experiential, and learner-centered lessons. Also, our assumption that female students will do better than male students in peace education was met. Implications of findings for curriculum review, instructional delivery and teacher education were discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - • Data from a project in Singapore were systematically analysed to discover grouting knowledge. • ANN was structured to correlate parameters quantifying onsite conditions with grouting design. • Total grout take at stations is found to be closely correlated with overall water inflow and Q value. • Grout take at certain station under conditions can be well anticipated utilizing onsite data. The existence of highly complex and heterogeneous geological and hydrogeological conditions makes it cumbersome to determine grouting parameters for a cost-efficient grouting process. Although many empirical, numerical and analytical models have been proposed previously, there are still some gaps between the existing predictive models and practical grouting applications, leading to the fact that practical grouting design mainly depends on onsite engineers' experience. In this study, we propose to use data mining to discover grouting knowledge from onsite data of a project in Singapore. After systematic analysis of data concerning the geological information, hydrogeological conditions and grouting records, an artificial neural network was structured to further extract grouting knowledge, based on which the grout take can be estimated under given geological and hydrogeological conditions. The grout take at individual station is found to be closely correlated with overall water inflow and Q value of rock mass, making it promising to estimate the potential grout take, once probe hole and face mapping information are given before pre-grouting. The degree of correlation between input parameters and the corresponding model accuracy are significantly affected by the classification methods used. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problemsolving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science education today focuses on preparing future citizens who are critical consumers of scientific knowledge and not merely recipients of scientific facts. Thus, meaningful science learning is important in the learning process. The aim of this paper is to explore approaches for facilitating meaningful science learning in a context where an additional language is used as a language of instruction. The findings of this article were drawn from a video study of six teachers in classrooms in Tanzania and group interviews with 18 of their students. The findings suggest various approaches that can support dialogue by the use of an additional language. From this study it was noted that the home language of the learners can be utilised as a mediating agent to facilitate meaningful science learning using an additional language. In addition, hands-on activities, the use of gestures and real-life examples emerge as strategies supporting meaningful science learning in a multilingual context. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Scientific problems of the twenty-first century involve complex research questions that require an interdisciplinary approach. Educational research suggests that overall student achievement is greater in an interdisciplinary science curriculum than in a discipline-specific science curriculum. Regardless, the secondary school science curriculum in Ontario remains discipline-specific. The Ontario Ministry of Education (OME) released an 'Interdisciplinary Studies' curriculum in 2002; however, it appears to be sparsely implemented across Ontario. The objective of this study is to investigate what guidelines are provided by the OME to help Ontario secondary school science teachers (grades 11–12) design and implement interdisciplinary science courses. A document analysis methodology is used to gather data from selected OME curriculum documents. The results of this study found that interdisciplinary science courses are based on multiple models of interdisciplinarity; however, the guidelines provided for developing interdisciplinary curriculum, assessment, and teaching methods do not explicitly indicate which type of interdisciplinary model is applied, nor do the documents explicitly consider the degree of integration of concepts and skills from across disciplines/subject areas. Primarily, the results of this study may inform Ontario Ministry science curriculum writers, teachers and educators interested in interdisciplinary science curriculum elsewhere, about what aspects of the selected curriculum documents provide practical information for developing interdisciplinary science courses and components of the curriculum that may warrant potential revisions or additions during future curriculum drafting.

AB  - Résumé: Les problèmes scientifiques du XXIe siècle soulèvent des questions de recherche complexes qui nécessitent une approche interdisciplinaire. Les recherches en pédagogie indiquent que le rendement général des élèves est meilleur dans un programme de sciences interdisciplinaire que dans un programme de sciences spécifique à chaque discipline. Pourtant, le curriculum scientifique dans les écoles ontariennes reste centré sur des programmes à une seule discipline. Le ministère de l'Éducation de l'Ontario (MEO) a publié en 2002 un programme d'études intitulé « Études interdisciplinaires », mais celui-ci semble avoir été peu appliqué dans toute la province. L'objectif de cette étude est d'examiner les lignes directrices fournies par le MEO pour aider les enseignants de sciences au secondaire en Ontario (11e et 12e année) à créer et à proposer des cours de sciences interdisciplinaires. Une méthodologie d'analyse de documents est utilisée pour recueillir des données tirées d'une série de documents choisis provenant des programmes d'études du MEO. Les résultats de cette étude montrent que les cours de sciences interdisciplinaires sont basés sur plusieurs modèles d'interdisciplinarité; cependant, les directives fournies pour l'élaboration de programmes, de modèles d'évaluation et de méthodes d'enseignement interdisciplinaires n'indiquent pas explicitement le type de modèle interdisciplinaire appliqué, et les documents ne prennent pas explicitement en compte le degré d'intégration des concepts et des compétences provenant des différentes disciplines. Essentiellement, les résultats de cette étude peuvent renseigner les enseignants et les concepteurs des programmes de sciences de l'Ontario, de même que les éducateurs qui s'intéressent aux programmes interdisciplinaires en sciences appliqués ailleurs dans le monde, d'une part sur les aspects particuliers des documents analysés qui sont susceptibles de fournir des informations pratiques pour la création de cours de sciences interdisciplinaires, et d'autre part sur les éléments du curriculum qui pourraient justifier d'éventuelles révisions ou des ajouts lors de l'élaboration de futurs programmes.

AB  - Learning tasks are a great motivation tool in chemistry teaching, necessary in the exposure and fixation part of a teaching process, and also often used when diagnosing the depth and type of student knowledge. Our research analysed the relationship between the student assessment in chemistry and their success in solving memory, algorithmic and conceptual tasks at symbolic, submicroscopic and macroscopic levels. The testing focused on chemical equilibrium, because this topic is appropriate to design and test the tasks. The collected data was evaluated by one-factor ANOVA analysis. We expected that, in comparison to average and weak learners, the excellent ones should be significantly more successful in tackling all the types of tasks and at all levels. However, our findings indicate that this assumption is invalid in the case of conceptual tasks, i.e. the understanding the depth of chemical concepts does not always correlate with the student assessment.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) leverages technology and concept mapping to support conceptual understanding, as well as collaborative learning to foster knowledge co-construction. This article investigated the effect of different instructional designs using CSCCM on students' conceptual understanding, and on the type of processes of knowledge co-construction that students engage. Participants (N = 120) were 10th graders enrolled in their physics course, randomly distributed in dyads. They were asked to draw concept maps related to the conservation of energy law, by using CSCCM with different instructional designs (i.e., control, Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). In the control condition, dyads worked collaboratively all the time. In both Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, dyads worked first individually (one week) and then collaboratively (two weeks). However, in Exp. 2, the individual concept map was shared with the peer before collaborating. Conceptual understanding improved significantly for learners in all three experimental conditions, especially in Exp. 2. Statistically significant differences were found in students' knowledge co-construction among the three conditions. Dyads in the control group showed a significantly higher use of quick consensus-building. Dyads in Exp. 1 showed a significantly higher reliance on externalization and elicitation. Dyads in Exp. 2 showed a significantly higher enacting of integration- and conflict-oriented consensus building. Accordingly, an instructional design like Exp. 2 optimizes CSCCM learning outcomes in terms of conceptual understanding and knowledge co-construction. • Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) enhances conceptual learning. • Instructional designs of CSCCM condition students' knowledge co-construction process. • An individual concept mapping preparation phase enhances CSCCM learning outcomes. • Sharing the individual concept map with the peer fosters cognitive group awareness. • A shared individual concept map optimizes students' CSCCM learning outcomes.

AB  - Definitions of neighbourhood in the Social Sciences are complex, varying in their characteristics (for example, perceived boundaries and content) and between residents of that neighbourhood (for example, by class and ethnicity). This study employs an under-utilised methodology offering strong potential for overcoming some of the difficulties associated with neighbourhood definitions. A mental mapping exercise involving local residents is showcased for an ethnically diverse working-class neighbourhood in south Liverpool. The results demonstrate distinctions between residents in the geographical demarcation of the area and the features included, with important implications for how neighbourhood is best measured and understood. We suggest that one size does not fit all in definitions of neighbourhood, and that mental mapping should form a more common part of a neighbourhood researcher's toolkit. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Sustainable development is a systems problem that requires a shift in thinking from individual parts to the relationships between them. Enabling those involved in the development process to more quickly think in systems is therefore vital to create more sustainable solutions. However, measuring the ability to think in systems is a challenge because of the limited methods to observe behavior or measure outcomes. Recent advances in neuroimaging offer a radically new approach to measure one's ability to think in systems. The specific technique, called functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS), captures the change in oxygenated blood in the cortical region of the brain, which is a proxy for elevated cognitive activation. In this study, engineering students (n = 28) performed both concept mapping (i.e., labeling concepts and drawing directional connections between them) and concept listing (i.e., generating a list of concepts without indicating relationships) related to grand challenges for sustainability. fNIRS captured the increase in oxygenated blood along the prefrontal and parietal cortex during both concept mapping and listing tasks. Self-evaluation and concept mapping scores were also captured and compared. Concept mapping led to significantly more concepts compared to concept listing. Concept mapping also required less cognitive resources (i.e., oxygenated blood) to generate more concepts. The region of the brain that received more cognitive resources is also significantly different when participants were using concept listing and mapping. Concept mapping directed more cognitive resources to the regions of the brain associated with cognitive flexibility and decreased cognitive resources in regions associated with visuospatial processing. Self-evaluation of systems thinking was negatively correlated with concept mapping scores, meaning students with high perceived ability produce worse concept maps. Global efficiency of brain networks was positively correlated to concept map scores and more accurately measure performance compared to self-evaluation. This study provides neurocognitive evidence to support the benefits of concept mapping and also demonstrates the added advantages of neuroimaging to study systems thinking. • Methods from neuroscience are applied to measure cognition during concept generation. • Empirical evidence describes the neurocognitive benefits of concept mapping for sustainability problems. • Self-evaluation is negatively correlated with actual performance while patterns of neuro-activation are positively correlated.

AB  - The key objective of this research was to generate new evidence on outpatient antibiotic prescription rate and patterns in the private sector in India. We used 12-month period (May 2013 to April 2014) medical audit dataset from IQVIA (formerly IMS Health). We coded the diagnosis provided in the medical audit data to International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10) and the prescribed antibiotics for the diagnosis to Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) classification of World Health Organization (ATC index-2016). We calculated and reported antibiotic prescription rate per 1,000 persons per year, by age groups, antibiotic class and disease conditions. Our main findings are—approximately 519 million antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed in the private sector, which translates into 412 prescriptions per 1,000 persons per year. Majority of the antibiotic prescriptions were dispensed for acute upper respiratory infections (J06) (20.4%); unspecified acute lower respiratory infection (J22) (12.8%); disorders of urinary system (N39) (6.0%); cough (R05) (4.7%); and acute nasopharyngitis (J00) (4.6%) and highest antibiotic prescription rates were observed in the age group 0–4 years. To conclude our study reports first ever country level estimates of antibiotic prescription by antibiotic classes, age groups, and ICD-10 mapped disease conditions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The paper deals with the problem of the city centre delimitation. The direct, survey research of almost one hundred respondents has been conducted. The test groups were teenagers, students of two Lublin schools. The research method was a freehand, basic mental sketch map, giving surveyed people a freedom of both content and form of a sketch. The mental (or cognitive) mapping is a well-established approach in the fields of psychology, geography, social science, planning and more with a wide scope of topics being tested with this methodology. The gathered data were processed in the GIS software using vectorization of the centre extents and map algebra approach. The results are presented in a form of data-aggregating maps for a whole group of students as well as for subgroups (different schools, different place of residence). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study utilized behavior-mapping to describe behavior and levels of activity in infants attending Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC). Descriptive statistics were used to determine proportion of time spent in certain locations, body positions, activities and engagement with others. To establish whether location, the presence of equipment or engagement with others influenced levels of activity, a paired t-test was used. Results indicated that of all locations, infants spent the greatest amount of time in the meals area (35%), with half of this period spent physically inactive (sedentary). The indoor play area was where infants were most active. Infants also spent a significantly greater proportion of their upright time (64%) supported by either furniture or equipment than without (MD 28, 95% CI 13-44, p < 0.01). Interestingly, infants displayed more sedentary behavior when engaged with others than when not engaged (MD 21, 95% CI 6-36, p < 0.01). The environment, presence of others and equipment availability appear to influence activity levels of infants in ECEC centers. Findings suggest that time spent in meal areas, provisions of furniture/equipment, and opportunities for infants to play independently warrant further exploration to determine their influence on activity levels in typically-developing infants.

AB  - The present study defined four types of stances/positions in students' argumentation regarding socio-scientific issues (SSIs): affirmative (A), oppositional (O), multiple (M), and non-committal (N) positions. The central goal of this study was to examine the effect of students' positions toward an issue on the science conceptual understanding and quality of their arguments. Three types of debates were concerned due to their abundant production of arguments: the debates between the (1) O vs. A, (2) O vs. M, and (3) O vs. N position students. The quasi-experimental design was adopted in which three 11th grade classes totaling 108 students were invited. They were assigned to the three required types of debate according to their positions regarding two given SSIs. The results showed that there were significant differences among the three debates on both the conceptual understanding and arguments produced by the students. The OA debate exhibited the best performance no matter in the conceptual understanding and the use of claims, warrants, and rebuttals. Moreover, the OM debate exhibited the best performance in terms of the use of qualifiers, whereas the ON debate students exhibited the lowest abilities and improvements. • Four types of positions in perceiving a socio-scientific issue were identified. • The relationships among these positions were clarified and investigated. • Explorative arguments emerged in debate with relationship of multiple viewpoints. • Competitive arguments emerged in debate with relationship of opposite viewpoints. • A web-based argumentation program was developed to support such learnings.

AB  - The present study aims to explore student-teachers' (STs') progress in understanding social urban sustainability and how it is affected through the development of digital stories and engagement in civic actions. Participants were 44 STs enrolled in a Department of Primary Education located in Northern Greece. Although participants were aware of the principles of sustainable development and education for sustainability, none of them had familiarity with social or urban sustainability. Three individual digital concept maps constructed before, intermediate and after the end of the course served as data sources. Both quantitative (significance testing, effect sizes, and confidence intervals) and qualitative (categories development) methods of analysis were implemented. Results indicate a sound improvement of STs' understanding even in the intermediate concept maps with the most significant proposition gains associated with the society pillar. Moreover, despite the significant improvement in understanding of all main pillars of sustainability, this improvement was unbalanced because a minority of subcategories constituted the majority of STs' propositions in all settings, indicating a strong and constructive combination between theory and praxis for the advancement of STs' learning.

AB  - Mixed forests play an important role in promoting forest functions and services, and showed better resilience to perturbations than monospecific forests. In the Mediterranean Basin they constitute an important share of the total forest area. However, although mixed forests have been described, classified and mapped in most of the Mediterranean regions around the world, in the Mediterranean Basin they remain neglected, with direct negative consequences for forest management and conservation strategies. Our objective is to present a reliable, uniform classification along with a map of the Spanish Mediterranean Mixed Forests (MMF) as a tool for their management and conservation in Spain. The digital Spanish Forest Map was analyzed to identify MMF. The most frequent tree species combinations were identified and their representativeness in terms of the total forest area was analyzed. In addition, to ensure environmental homogeneity in the proposed classification, the arrangement of each tree species combination within the Spanish Mediterranean ecoregions was evaluated using the Pearson Chi-square test. Based on our results, Spanish MMF currently cover 27.07% of the Mediterranean natural forest area. They were divided into 9 main ecological groups and 23 subtypes. The classification of Spanish MMF and the distribution map represent a first step towards recognizing the importance of mixed forests in the vegetation of the Mediterranean Basin. Together they may provide a valuable basis to improve future forest management, monitoring and conservation strategies both at national and European level. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: In implementation research, it is essential to involve all stakeholders in the development of complex interventions to ensure that the proposed intervention strategy is relevant and acceptable to the target area and group. The aim of this study was to involve stakeholders in conceptualising, developing, and prioritising a feasible intervention strategy to improve the 6‐month exclusive breastfeeding rate in North‐east Thailand. Concept mapping was used in a purposive sample including health care volunteers, health care professionals, and community leaders. During the first meeting, stakeholders (n = 22) expressed the generation of feasible interventions. During the second meeting, participants (n = 21) were asked to individually rate the feasibility of each intervention and to group them into relevant categories to enable multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. The outputs of analysis included the intervention list, cluster list, point map, point rating map, cluster map, and cluster rating map. All of these were shared with stakeholders (n = 17) during the third meeting to reach consensus on an intervention model. The final proposed intervention strategy included 15 feasible interventions in five clusters: health care services, community services, and education packages for parents, family members, and communities. These interventions were prioritised for implementation over a 3‐year period. Once the feasibility of each intervention is established, the proposed model could be implemented and incorporated into local health policy. After assessing intervention effectiveness, each intervention could be scaled up to other middle‐income countries to help improve overall maternal and child survival. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and objectives:  The construction of whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging atlases allows to perform statistical analysis with applications in anomaly detection, longitudinal, and correlation studies. Atlas-based methods require a common coordinate system to which all the subjects are mapped through image registration. Optimisation of the reference space is an important aspect that affects the subsequent analysis of the registered data, and having a reference space that is neutral with respect to local tissue volume is valuable in correlation studies. The purpose of this work is to generate a reference space for whole-body imaging that has zero voxel-wise average volume change when mapped to a cohort. Methods:  This work proposes an approach to register multiple whole-body images to a common template using volume changes to generate a synthetic reference space, starting with an initial reference and refining it by warping it with a deformation that brings the voxel-wise average volume change associated to the mappings of all the images in the cohort to zero. Results:  Experiments on fat/water separated whole-body MR images show how the method effectively generates a reference space neutral with respect to volume changes, without reducing the quality of the registration nor introducing artefacts in the anatomy, while providing better alignment when compared to an implicit reference groupwise approach. Conclusions:  The proposed method allows to quickly generate a reference space neutral with respect to local volume changes, that retains the registration quality of a sharp template, and that can be used for statistical analysis of voxel-wise correlations in large datasets of whole-body image data.

AB  - Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged as the dominant approach to achieving successive advancements in the creation of human-wise agents. By leveraging neural networks as decision-making controllers, DRL supplements traditional reinforcement methods to address the curse of dimensionality in complicated tasks. However, agents in complicated environments are likely to get stuck in sub-optimal solutions. In such cases, the agent inadvertently turns into a "zombie" owing to its short-term vision and harmful behaviors. In this study, we use human learning strategies to adjust agent behaviors in high-dimensional environments. Therefore, the agent behaves predictably and succeeds in attaining its designated goal. In summary, the contribution of this study is two-fold. First, we introduce a lightweight workflow that enables a nonexpert to preserve a certain level of safety in AI systems. Specifically, the workflow involves a novel concept of a target map and a multi-agent behavioral control system named Multi-Policy Control System (MPCS). MPCS successfully controls agent behaviors in real time without involving the burden of human feedback. Second, we develop a multi-agent game named Tank Battle that provides a configurable environment to examine agent behaviors and human-agent interactions in DRL. Finally, simulation results show that agents guided by MPCS outperform agents that do not use MPCS with respect to the mean of total rewards and human-like behaviors in complicated environments such as Seaquest and Tank Battle.

AB  - Can physical concepts and laws emerge in a neural network as it learns to predict the observation data of physical systems? As a benchmark and a proof-of-principle study of this possibility, here we show an introspective learning architecture that can automatically develop the concept of the quantum wave function and discover the Schrödinger equation from simulated experimental data of the potential-to-density mappings of a quantum particle. This introspective learning architecture contains a machine translator to perform the potential to density mapping, and a knowledge distiller auto-encoder to extract the essential information and its update law from the hidden states of the translator, which turns out to be the quantum wave function and the Schrödinger equation. We envision that our introspective learning architecture can enable machine learning to discover new physics in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Knowledge integration is an important aspect of education. In clinical education, there is an emphasis on the integration of basic medical science with clinical practice to provide a higher order of comprehension for future physicians. Also of importance in medical education is the promotion and development of professional behaviors (i.e., teamwork and interpersonal professional behavior). We set out to design and implement a weekly, 2 hour educational active learning activity for first-year preclinical medical students to foster knowledge integration and to promote professional development. As part of our case-based curriculum, we used a small-group active-learning approach involving 3 stages: concept mapping, student peer-review, and student group evaluation. Specific learning objectives and behavioral outcomes were designed to focus the learning activities. Rubrics were designed to (1) assess learners' group generated concept maps, (2) determine effective student peer review, and (3) appropriate evaluation of group dynamics. In addition to assessment data from the rubrics, course evaluations from participating students were collected. Analysis of rubric assessments and student evaluation data confirmed that there was significant statistical achievement in critical thinking and teamwork among students. Furthermore, when analyzing concept mapping scores between the first and last case, the data displayed significant statistical improvement supporting that student groups were further integrating basic science and clinical concepts. Our concept map-based active-learning approach achieved our designated objectives and outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper aims to study the effectiveness of using RStudio (an open source statistical package) in learning statistics among undergraduate students in Malaysia. A pre-post test quasi-experimental with control group design was employed. This study was conducted on 50 first year students from various fields of study taking the Statistics for Applied Sciences subject for selected topics from the syllabus. The students were equally assigned to the experimental and control groups respec- tively. Descriptive analysis showed that students performed better when using RStudio as compared to control group with higher means in post- test and post-delay-test scores. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was employed with the pre-test scores as covariate, group as the indepen- dent variable while post-test and post-delay-test scores as the dependent variables. ANCOVA indicated that there is a significant difference in the post-test scores between the groups as well as in the post-delay-test scores between the groups where students who has been exposed to and using RStudio achieved significantly better performance in pre-test and post-test. These findings imply that integration of a statistical package is effective in enhancing the learning process of statistics. In essence, sta- tistical packages like RStudio would ease the learning process and help students to achieve better results in statistics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In our systematic mapping study, we examined 289 published works to determine which intelligent computing methods (e.g. Artificial Neural Networks, Machine Learning, and Fuzzy Logic) used by air-conditioning systems can provide energy savings and improve thermal comfort. Our goal was to identify which methods have been used most in research on the topic, which methods of data collection have been employed, and which areas of research have been empirical in nature. We observed the rules for literature reviews in identifying published works on databases (e.g. the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers database, the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, SpringerLink, ScienceDirect, and Wiley Online Library) and classified identified works by topic. After excluding works according to the predefined criteria, we reviewed selected works according to the research parameters motivating our study. Results reveal that energy savings is the most frequently examined topic and that intelligent computing methods can be used to provide better indoor environments for occupants, with energy savings of up to 50%. The most common intelligent method used has been artificial neural networks, while sensors have been the tools most used to collect data, followed by searches of databases of experiments, simulations, and surveys accessed to validate the accuracy of findings.

AB  - The Framework for K-12 Education and the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) encourage us to actively engage students in learning experiences that help them integrate core ideas in a discipline, central science and engineering practices, and crosscutting concepts (NRC 2012). My ability to design lessons, orchestrate learning environments, and build assessments in which I felt core ideas, practices, and crosscutting concepts were seamlessly integrated significantly improved when I started thinking about crosscutting concepts in a different way. A teacher may use them as guiding tools to help structure student reasoning or as formative assessments that create opportunities to provide feedback as students develop understanding.

AB  - Generation and energy consumption are a major issue in different countries around the world. Nowadays, projects under development seek the modernization of electric power generation and distribution systems. One of the main strategies is the design of context-adaptable micro-grid architectures. The micro-grid concept focuses on a controlled, monitored and highly autonomous use of electric power supported on information technologies, for the optimization of energy transfer, minimize risks and increase the system’s quality, efficiency and reliability. This article, therefore, aims to identify, classify and compare different micro-grid architectures, based on their applicability and research trends. A systematic mapping study of micro-grid architectures is conducted to examine the experimental and theoretical contributions made by the scientific community. This article categorizes and quantifies the different studies related to the subject, identifying and analyzing the strengths and opportunities for improvement in the applicability of micro-grid architectures. The trends observed highlight five strategies as the most relevant, whose different characteristics contribute to an automated and intelligent organization of the distribution, control and supervision of electricity according to supply versus demand.

AB  - Background:  Cognitive impairment affects up to 80 percent of the stroke population, however, both the available evidence about post-stroke cognition and the measures used to evaluate it longitudinally have not been well described. The aims of this systematic scoping review were: to identify and characterize studies evaluating cognition longitudinally after stroke; to summarize the cognitive instruments used and the domains they target; and to organize cognitive domains assessed using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF). Methods:  We used a systematic scoping approach to search for peer-reviewed articles involving adults with stroke that evaluated cognition longitudinally. Screening of titles, abstracts, and full reports was completed independently by two reviewers, across six electronic databases (PubMed, PsycInfo, Medline, Cinahl Plus, Embase, and Web of Science). Cognitive domains were mapped to an ICF function independently by the same two reviewers, using a previously tested, standardized approach. Results:  A total of 5,540 records were found; 257 were included, representing a total pooled sample of 120,860 stroke survivors. Of these studies, 200 (78%) provided specific cognitive outcomes from the longitudinal evaluations, 57 (22%) reported model predictions, and 77 (30%) included interventions. Cognition was evaluated with 356 unique instruments, targeting 95 distinct cognitive domains, and 17 mental functions from the ICF. The Mini-Mental State Examination was the most frequently used instrument (117 reports, 46%). Other tools used longitudinally were the Trail Making Test (17% of reports), tests of verbal fluency (14%), the Functional Independence Measure (14%), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (13%), the Digit Span (11%), and the Stroop test (10%). Global cognition was evaluated in 170 reports (66%), followed by higher-level cognitive functioning (29%), memory (28%), language (21%), attention (21%), and perceptual skills (14%). Studies using functional (or performance-based) cognitive assessments over time were scarce (< 1%). Conclusion:  Our findings indicate that whilst there is a substantial number of studies available that report longitudinal evaluations of cognition after stroke, there is large variability in the measures used and the cognitive domains they target. Nonetheless, the available data for evaluation of cognition over time after stroke can be organized and described systematically. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Knowledge of key variables driving the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance over a vegetated surface is an important step to derive biophysical variables from TOA radiance data, e.g., as observed by an optical satellite. Coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) allow linking vegetation variables directly to the at-sensor TOA radiance measured. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of RTMs enables the computation of the total contribution of each input variable to the output variance. We determined the impacts of the leaf-canopy-atmosphere variables into TOA radiance using the GSA to gain insights into retrievable variables. The leaf and canopy RTM PROSAIL was coupled with the atmospheric RTM MODTRAN5. Because of MODTRAN's computational burden and GSA's demand for many simulations, we first developed a surrogate statistical learning model, i.e., an emulator, that allows approximating RTM outputs through a machine learning algorithm with low computation time. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) emulator was used to reproduce lookup tables of TOA radiance as a function of 12 input variables with relative errors of 2.4%. GSA total sensitivity results quantified the driving variables of emulated TOA radiance along the 400–2500 nm spectral range at 15 cm − 1 (between 0.3–9 nm); overall, the vegetation variables play a more dominant role than atmospheric variables. This suggests the possibility to retrieve biophysical variables directly from at-sensor TOA radiance data. Particularly promising are leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water thickness and leaf area index, as these variables are the most important drivers in governing TOA radiance outside the water absorption regions. A software framework was developed to facilitate the development of retrieval models from at-sensor TOA radiance data. As a proof of concept, maps of these biophysical variables have been generated for both TOA (L1C) and bottom-of-atmosphere (L2A) Sentinel-2 data by means of a hybrid retrieval scheme, i.e., training GPR retrieval algorithms using the RTM simulations. Obtained maps from L1C vs L2A data are consistent, suggesting that vegetation properties can be directly retrieved from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of an atmospheric correction.

AB  - Physical sciences teachers in low-quintile South African schools avoid the use of inquiry on the grounds of inefficiency and ineffectiveness for test preparation. This avoidance is consistent with the view that the high cognitive load inquiry offers to extreme novices such as these learners may be prohibitive. Given the purported benefits of inquiry, this situation seems lamentable, but until empirical evidence is found to the contrary, the applicability of inquiry in this context appears an impractical ideal. In this study I begin the search for evidence of benefits of inquiry for the education of learners from such backgrounds, albeit within an educational setting atypical of the context. I investigate the effectiveness of a week-long inquiry holiday programme for 26 Grade 8 and 9 learners from low-quintile schools and the predictive value of their Natural Sciences marks for success in the programme. The findings show statistically significant learning gains from pre- to post-test scores and pre- to delayed post-test scores, as well as strong correlations between the learners' Natural Sciences marks and the post-test scores. This shows that holiday inquiry programmes can be effective at promoting learning, measured by test-performance, even for learners with backgrounds of underprivilege, at least among higher achieving learners.

AB  - Knowledge integration is an important aspect of education. In clinical education, there is an emphasis on the integration of basic medical science with clinical practice to provide a higher order of comprehension for future physicians. Also of importance in medical education is the promotion and development of professional behaviors (i.e., teamwork and interpersonal professional behavior). We set out to design and implement a weekly, 2 hour educational active learning activity for first-year preclinical medical students to foster knowledge integration and to promote professional development. As part of our case-based curriculum, we used a small-group active-learning approach involving 3 stages: concept mapping, student peer-review, and student group evaluation. Specific learning objectives and behavioral outcomes were designed to focus the learning activities. Rubrics were designed to (1) assess learners' group generated concept maps, (2) determine effective student peer review, and (3) appropriate evaluation of group dynamics. In addition to assessment data from the rubrics, course evaluations from participating students were collected. Analysis of rubric assessments and student evaluation data confirmed that there was significant statistical achievement in critical thinking and teamwork among students. Furthermore, when analyzing concept mapping scores between the first and last case, the data displayed significant statistical improvement supporting that student groups were further integrating basic science and clinical concepts. Our concept map-based active-learning approach achieved our designated objectives and outcomes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In 1982, Trillas introduced the notion of indistinguishability operator with the main aim of fuzzifying the crisp notion of equivalence relation. In the study of such a class of operators, an outstanding property must be stressed. Concretely, there exists a duality relationship between indistinguishability operators and metrics. The aforesaid relationship was deeply studied by several authors that introduced a few techniques to generate metrics from indistinguishability operators and vice versa. In the last years, a new generalization of the metric notion has been introduced in the literature with the purpose of developing mathematical tools for quantitative models in computer science and artificial intelligence. The aforesaid generalized metrics are known as relaxed metrics. The main purpose of the present paper is to explore the possibility of making explicit a duality relationship between indistinguishability operators and relaxed metrics in such a way that the aforementioned classical techniques to generate both concepts, one from the other, can be extended to the new framework.

AB  - The aim of the study was to analyse the relevance of global issues among university students for their field of study. The research sample consisted of 581 students of Matej Bel University (Faculty of Economics, Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Education, Faculty of Natural Sciences and Faculty of Political Sciences and International Relations) in BanskÃ¡ Bystrica. For the data collection we used a scale questionnaire mapping the degree of importance of global issues among students in relation to their fields of study (Andreotti et al., 2013). Exploratory factor analysis was used to analyse its internal structure. The value of Cronbach's alpha per dimension ranged from 0.74 to 0.85. We identified a statistically significant difference in the relevance of global issues among students for their field in favour of human rights and economic-social development issues. We noticed a statistically significant difference in the relevance of the global issues in terms of student gender for their field of study in the human rights dimension for the benefit of the female students. The statistically significant difference in the relevance of global issues in terms of student discipline for their field was confirmed in the dimensions of economic-political and economicsocial development in favour of non-pedagogical students and in the human rights dimension in favour of students with pedagogical disciplines. There was no statistically significant difference in the relevance of global issues in terms of students' degree courses for their field of study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Summary: Network science is an emerging area of complexity science that uses mathematical techniques to study complex systems and could represent a new way of quantifying and investigating the internal structure of domain‐specific knowledge as approximated by students' concept maps. Students enrolled in introductory psychology constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of a psychology chapter. Concept networks were constructed based on the concept maps generated by students. Network analysis revealed that the structure of concept networks differed across students (i.e., some networks were better connected than others), and network structure significantly predicted quiz scores, such that concept networks with larger average shortest path lengths (a network metric representing the average of the shortest paths between two nodes in a network) were associated with higher quiz scores, after controlling for network size. This paper illustrates how network science techniques can be used to quantify the conceptual structure of a learner's knowledge. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Passive margins are the locus of tectonic and magmatic processes leading to the formation of highly variable along-strike and conjugate margins structures. Using extensive new seismic, gravity, and magnetic datasets, complemented by seabed samples and field work, we investigate the tectonomagmatic evolution of the northwest (NW) Atlantic where breakup-related igneous rocks were emplaced during several Paleogene events associated with lithospheric stretching, continental breakup, and the formation of new oceanic basins. Interpretational methods include integrated seismic-gravity-magnetic (SGM) interpretation and seismic volcanostratigraphy. In addition, seabed and field samples were collected and analyzed to constrain the basin stratigraphy, hydrocarbon potential, and the geochronology and geochemistry of the volcanic sequences. Offshore, 2D seismic data reveal several Seaward Dipping Reflector (SDR) wedges and escarpments in the Labrador Sea, Davis Strait, and Baffin Bay. Onshore, eastward prograding foreset-bedded hyaloclastite delta deposits and overlying horizontal lava successions outcrop on Nuussuaq. These hyaloclastites and lava successions are world class analogues to the Lava Delta and Landward Flows volcanic seismic facies units identified offshore. Our mapping results document an aerial extent of the Paleogene breakup-related volcanics of 0.3 × 106 km2, with an estimated volume of 0.5–0.6 × 106 km3. Basalt samples recovered by dredging the Upernavik Escarpment have late Paleocene to/early Eocene ages, whereas the sedimentary samples provide an excellent seismic tie with the stratigraphy and the geology in this frontier area. From the integrated SGM interpretation, we identify a rapidly thinning crust and changes in top and intra-basement seismic reflection characteristics in the oceanic domain correlated with transition between different magnetic domains. The mapping results were subsequently integrated in a plate tectonic model. The plate tectonic reconstruction and basalt geochronology suggest that the majority of the volcanism in the NW Atlantic occurred between ~62 and ~58 Ma, associated with an increased spreading rate in the Labrador Sea, starting from the onset of the Selandian (~61.6 Ma). A change in the spreading direction during the Eocene (~56 Ma), synchronously with a shift of volcanic activity from the NW to the NE Atlantic, correspond to a northward drift of Greenland and the initiation of the Eurekan Orogeny. Finally, our interpretations reveal a complex rift configuration along the NW Atlantic conjugate margins both prior to and during breakup. • Determination of the tectonomagmatic evolution of the NW Atlantic • Mapping of the breakup-related magmatism using the vocanostratigraphy concept • Mapping of the magnetic and gravimetric crustal domain patterns and their boundaries using integrated SGM method • Analyses of seabed and onshore samples and field analogues work • New plate tectonic reconstruction for the NW Atlantic [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research in big data, informatics, and bioinformatics has grown dramatically (Andreu-Perez J, et al. , 2015, IEEE Journal of Biomedical and Health Informatics 19, 1193–1208). Advances in gene sequencing technologies, surveillance systems, and electronic medical records have increased the amount of health data available. Unconventional data sources such as social media, wearable sensors, and internet search engine activity have also contributed to the influx of health data. The purpose of this study was to describe how 'big data', 'informatics', and 'bioinformatics' have been used in the animal health and veterinary medical literature and to map and chart publications using these terms through time. A scoping review methodology was used. A literature search of the terms 'big data', 'informatics', and 'bioinformatics' was conducted in the context of animal health and veterinary medicine. Relevance screening on abstract and full-text was conducted sequentially. In order for articles to be relevant, they must have used the words 'big data', 'informatics', or 'bioinformatics' in the title or abstract and full-text and have dealt with one of the major animal species encountered in veterinary medicine. Data items collected for all relevant articles included species, geographic region, first author affiliation, and journal of publication. The study level, study type, and data sources were collected for primary studies. After relevance screening, 1093 were classified. While there was a steady increase in 'bioinformatics' articles between 1995 and the end of the study period, 'informatics' articles reached their peak in 2012, then declined. The first 'big data' publication in animal health and veterinary medicine was in 2012. While few articles used the term 'big data' (n = 14), recent growth in 'big data' articles was observed. All geographic regions produced publications in 'informatics' and 'bioinformatics' while only North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia/Oceania produced publications about 'big data'. 'Bioinformatics' primary studies tended to use genetic data and tended to be conducted at the genetic level. In contrast, 'informatics' primary studies tended to use non-genetic data sources and conducted at an organismal level. The rapidly evolving definition of 'big data' may lead to avoidance of the term. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept map mining (CMM) has emerged as a new research area with recent developments in computational intelligence in educational technology. CMM includes the following steps: extracting the learning concepts from educational content, specifying relations among them, and generating a concept map as a result. The purpose of this study was to develop a mechanism using data mining technique to determine the features that characterize a learning concept extracted automatically from a single educational text. The 3 major features that distinguish the real learning concepts from other sequences of strings are detected by using a hybrid system of a feed‐forward neural network and some evolutionary algorithms. Ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are used as a binary feature selection method. In addition, the aforementioned methods are hybridized to get better accuracy and precision. The performance comparisons with two different state‐of‐the‐art algorithms have been made from the viewpoint of a typical classification problem. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - One of the key agendas for the emerging field of disciplinary-based education research is the evaluation of the trajectory of disciplinary knowledge development from novice to expert. However, with the ongoing promotion of student-centered and collaborative undergraduate science classrooms, it is unknown how peer discourse during these exercises might influence (promote or hinder) student construction of expert knowledge. This study documented the knowledge structures of n = 13 undergraduate biology students in a first semester biology course for majors across four instructional units. Participants constructed both individual and group-negotiated concept maps and map complexity, propositional stream similarity, and propositional accuracy were used as measures of quality of knowledge structure. Results indicated that on individually-constructed maps, in general, students had moderate quality knowledge structures when compared to experts. Individual map complexity seemed to increase over time, but stream similarity and propositional accuracy were more dependent on content unit. Group-constructed maps were consistently more accurate than individually-constructed maps. Results are discussed in the context of the use of collaborative concept mapping as a means to develop disciplinary expertise in biology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigates the impact of the Case-Based Learning (CBL) method for the topic of 'B6, B9 and B12 Vitamins' on students' academic achievement in a biochemistry course for an associate degree level in health. To this end, a case study with the title 'The Reasons for Depression: Do We Know What They Are?' was developed and implemented. The study had a one-group pre-test and post-test research design. The 'Vitamins' Achievement Test' (VAT) and a Structured Interview Form were used as data collection tools. First-year students of Medical Laboratory Techniques at the Ahmet Erdogan Vocational School of Health Services at Bulent Ecevit University (N = 34) who were aged between18 and 20 made up the study group. The VAT and the Structured Interview Form were analysed using content analysis and the paired-samples t-test was used for the VAT. The results indicated that the frequency of students' responses in the 'clear understanding' category improved in the VAT post-test and it was concluded that there was a significant positive difference in the post-test scores of students. The results of the structured interview indicated that most of the students had positive opinions about the method, material and case study. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper focuses on the design and evaluation of a theory‐based computer‐assisted summary writing learning environment called Summary Writing‐PAL (SW‐PAL). The SW‐PAL was developed based on four aspects: summarizing strategies, learning theories, prior knowledge, and cognitive load. A quasi‐experiment that involved 58 undergraduates majoring in Computer Science was conducted to examine the effectiveness of SW‐PAL in writing summaries. Two intact classes were selected with 28 and 30 students in control and experimental groups, respectively. The conventional teaching approach was employed in the control group, whereas the SW‐PAL was introduced to the experimental group. Pretest and posttest were administrated to both groups. The findings indicated that SW‐PAL improved students' summary writing performance. A significant variance was noted between intrinsic and extraneous cognitive load among students with varying levels of English proficiency in the experimental group, signifying that the SW‐PAL is more suitable for students with lower language proficiency. Lay Description: What is already known about this topic: Currently, there has been a lot of interest in CAL English language and numerous summary writing tools have been developed for language learning and teaching.Existing summary writing tools did not focus on learning theories incorporation.Worked examples approach is effective in well‐defined domain (mathematics, physics, etc.), how about if apply in ill‐defined domain (summary writing)? What this paper adds: Design and develop a CAL environment for summary writing.Incorporate learning theories in CAL environment.Apply worked example instructional approach in learning summary writing. Implications for practice and/or policy: Conventional teaching versus CAL environment in summary writing: CAL environment achieved better performance.Worked examples in ill‐defined domain (summary writing) are also effective in language learning.Worked examples is more effective for lower English language proficiency students.Cognitive load: Lower language proficiency students demonstrated lower cognitive load when using CAL environment.

AB  - Invasion biology has been quickly expanding in the last decades so that it is now metaphorically flooded with publications, concepts, and hypotheses. Among experts, there is no clear consensus about the relationships between invasion concepts, and almost no one seems to have a good overview of the literature anymore. Similar observations can be made for other research fields. Science needs new navigation tools so that researchers within and outside of a research field as well as science journalists, students, teachers, practitioners, policy-makers, and others interested in the field can more easily understand its key ideas. Such navigation tools could, for example, be maps of the major concepts and hypotheses of a research field. Applying a bibliometric method, we created such maps for invasion biology. We analysed research papers of the last two decades citing at least two of 35 common invasion hypotheses. Co-citation analysis yields four distinct clusters of hypotheses. These clusters can describe the main directions in invasion biology and explain basic driving forces behind biological invasions. The method we outline here for invasion biology can be easily applied for other research fields. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Ranked set sampling (RSS) is an advanced data collection method when the exact measurement of an observation is difficult and/or expensive used in a number of research areas, e.g., environment, bioinformatics, ecology, etc. In this method, random sets are drawn from a population and the units in sets are ranked with a ranking mechanism which is based on a visual inspection or a concomitant variable. Because of the importance of working with a good design and easy analysis, there is a need for a software tool which provides sampling designs and statistical inferences based on RSS and its modifications. This paper introduces an R package as a free and easy-to-use analysis tool for both sampling processes and statistical inferences based on RSS and its modified versions. For researchers, the RSSampling package provides a sample with RSS, extreme RSS, median RSS, percentile RSS, balanced groups RSS, double versions of RSS, L-RSS, truncation-based RSS, and robust extreme RSS when the judgment rankings are both perfect and imperfect. Researchers can also use this new package to make parametric inferences for the population mean and the variance where the sample is obtained via classical RSS.

AB  - The inability of students to absorb the knowledge conveyed by the teacher is'nt caused by the inability of understanding and by the teacher which isn't able to teach too, but because of the mismatch of learning styles between students and teachers, so that students feel uncomfortable in learning to a particular teacher. It also happens in senior high school (SHS/SMAN) 1 Anggana, so it is necessary to do this research, to analyze cluster (group) of student learning style by applying data mining method that is k-Means and Fuzzy C-Means. The purpose was to know the effectiveness of this learning style cluster on the development of absorptive power and improving student achievement. The method used to cluster the learning style with data mining process starts from the data cleaning stage, data selection, data transformation, data mining, pattern evolution, and knowledge development.

AB  - Disease ecology is a rapidly growing subdiscipline, and mammals and their parasites feature prominently in both historical and more recent research efforts. Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e. the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological–microbiological, biogeographic–macroecological, vector-focused (e.g. mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery–disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal–pathogen–disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal–parasite interactions.

AB  - La ecología de las enfermedades es una subdisciplina en rápido crecimiento, y los mamíferos y sus parásitos ocupan un lugar destacado en los esfuerzos de investigación tanto históricos como en los más recientes. Sin embargo, la diversidad de temas estudiados, y de aquellos que no han sido tan bien explorados, no ha sido evaluada sistemáticamente. Llevamos a cabo una revisión sistemática de la literatura científica publicada respecto a ecología de las enfermedades en mamíferos, y sometimos los artículos originales y revisiones encontradas a un análisis temático basado en las palabras utilizadas en las publicaciones y en el contexto de uso (es decir, la frecuencia y la intensidad de las relaciones semánticas). Además de definir mapas conceptuales que muestran los temas de investigación más destacados, identificamos ocho subcategorías de estudios (no mutuamente excluyentes), que incluyen estudios experimentales, teóricos, comparativos, de comportamiento, inmunológicos-microbiológicos, biogeográficos-macroecológicos, centrados en vectores (por ejemplo, mosquitos), y enfocados en perturbaciones. Los temas más relevantes que surgieron de los artículos de revisión incluyeron la ecología de las enfermedades zoonóticas transmitidas por mamíferos no humanos, las comparaciones de la prevalencia de patógenos entre especies de mamíferos, y los estudios de monitoreo para asociar patógenos y enfermedades, en particular de mamíferos marinos y murciélagos. En los artículos originales, los temas más destacados incluyeron la ecología de las enfermedades virales y bacterianas transmitidas por roedores, y la biología de poblaciones en huéspedes zoonóticos. La mayoría de los estudios utilizaron enfoques comparativos o descriptivos para investigar las relaciones entre mamíferos, patógenos y enfermedades a escala local, centrándose en las enfermedades transmitidas por vectores. Estudios con enfoques experimentales, utilizando modelos matemáticos, o estudios inmunológicos y de comportamiento fueron sorprendentemente más escasos. Los temas de gran importancia conceptual, pero que están poco representados en la literatura actual, incluyen: 1) los efectos de la densidad de la población de los mamíferos hospedadores, y de las manipulaciones de esta densidad, sobre la transmisión de patógenos; 2) estudios macroecológicos que cuantifican los efectos de los mamíferos hospedadores en la abundancia y prevalencia de parásitos; y 3) los efectos del cambio climático en los procesos fisiológicos y de comportamiento relevantes para las interacciones mamífero-parásito.

AB  - Aim. Neural plastic changes are experience and learning dependent, yet exploiting this knowledge to enhance clinical outcomes after stroke is in its infancy. Our aim was to search the available evidence for the core concepts of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning; identify links between these concepts; and identify and review the themes that best characterise the intersection of these three concepts. Methods. We developed a novel approach to identify the common research topics among the three areas: neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning. A concept map was created a priori, and separate searches were conducted for each concept. The methodology involved three main phases: data collection and filtering, development of a clinical vocabulary, and the development of an automatic clinical text processing engine to aid the process and identify the unique and common topics. The common themes from the intersection of the three concepts were identified. These were then reviewed, with particular reference to the top 30 articles identified as intersecting these concepts. Results. The search of the three concepts separately yielded 405,636 publications. Publications were filtered to include only human studies, generating 263,751 publications related to the concepts of neuroplasticity (n=6,498), stroke recovery (n=79,060), and learning (n=178,193). A cluster concept map (network graph) was generated from the results; indicating the concept nodes, strength of link between nodes, and the intersection between all three concepts. We identified 23 common themes (topics) and the top 30 articles that best represent the intersecting themes. A time-linked pattern emerged. Discussion and Conclusions. Our novel approach developed for this review allowed the identification of the common themes/topics that intersect the concepts of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning. These may be synthesised to advance a neuroscience-informed approach to stroke rehabilitation. We also identified gaps in available literature using this approach. These may help guide future targeted research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The aim of this research is to ask what kind of geography is taught in Finnish upper secondary schools and whether this knowledge is powerful knowledge. This is achieved by analysing 11 in-service geography teachers' concept maps and in-depth interviews with qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the dominance of three terms: spatiality, phenomena and a holistic approach running through the teachers' conceptions of geographical knowledge, skills and assessment. Geography is described by the teachers as a science which studies extensive spatial phenomena with the help of concepts and a holistic approach and in which values and students' own lived experiences play a major role. We conclude that the in-service Finnish upper secondary teachers' perceptions of geography are a form of powerful knowledge because they: (1) urge students to form new geographical thinking about the world, (2) give possibilities for students to study geographical phenomena and (3) evaluate their own knowledge, (4) encourage students to follow topical debates in different scales, (5) open up the students' world views and (6) support the general objectives of Finnish upper secondary schools by applying four of the six cross-curricular themes to a great extent in teaching geography, particularly sustainable development.

AB  - The evolution of the socio-cognitive structure of the field of knowledge management (KM) during the period 1986–2015 is described. Records retrieved from Web of Science were submitted to author co-citation analysis (ACA) following a longitudinal perspective as of the following time slices: 1986–1996, 1997–2006, and 2007–2015. The top 10% of most cited first authors by sub-periods were mapped in bibliometric networks in order to interpret the communities formed and their relationships. KM is a homogeneous field as indicated by networks results. Nine classical authors are identified since they are highly co-cited in each sub-period, highlighting Ikujiro Nonaka as the most influential authors in the field. The most significant communities in KM are devoted to strategic management, KM foundations, organisational learning and behaviour, and organisational theories. Major trends in the evolution of the intellectual structure of KM evidence a technological influence in 1986–1996, a strategic influence in 1997–2006, and finally a sociological influence in 2007–2015. Describing a field from a single database can offer biases in terms of output coverage. Likewise, the conference proceedings and books were not used and the analysis was only based on first authors. However, the results obtained can be very useful to understand the evolution of KM research. These results might be useful for managers and academicians to understand the evolution of KM field and to (re)define research activities and organisational projects. The novelty of this paper lies in considering ACA as a bibliometric technique to study KM research. In addition, our investigation has a wider time coverage than earlier articles.

AB  - The adoption of the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) Framework for Information Literacy for Higher Education in 2016 coincided with the launch of the digital edition of the Geographic Information Science and Technology (GIS&T) Body of Knowledge. The GIS&T Body of Knowledge and the ACRL Framework share a common goal of providing a flexible, community-driven, living document to support teaching and learning in higher education. The Body of Knowledge serves as a representation of the GIS&T knowledge domain, while the ACRL Framework aids librarians in integrating core information literacy concepts into instruction in their respective knowledge domains. Despite this connection, no attempt to evaluate how these guiding documents can be aligned to one another to inform instructional practice has yet been reported. This study uses a relative crosswalk approach to map connections between the knowledge practices and dispositions in the ACRL Framework and the learning objectives in the GIS&T Body of Knowledge. This analysis highlights alignment between these documents and can serve as a conceptual foundation to make it easier for map, geospatial, and subject librarians to identify practical opportunities for integrating information literacy instruction into GIS&T education, both independently and in collaboration with disciplinary faculty.

AB  - It is a common practice in the solar physics community to judge whether the measured photospheric vector magnetograms are force-free or not. In the previous work, it was studied how the measurement limitations such as the limited field of view, instrument sensitivity, and measurement error could affect the judgement of force-freeness based on the observed magnetograms. A further research on the influence of the spatial resolution on the force-freeness judgement is carried out in this article. The result shows that changing (mainly reducing) the spatial resolution has little influence on the force-freeness judgement in the ideal noiseless case. In the case when there are white noises in the magnetograms as those in the really observed magnetograms, it is opposite to the common intuition that properly reducing the spatial resolution can actually suppress the error, and significantly reduce the heavy influence of the measurement error on the force-freeness judgement, thus to enhance effectively the accuracy of the force-freeness judgement of magnetic field. This result sets up a theoretical foundation and an instructive guidance for judging the force-freeness of solar magnetic field correctly by using the observed magnetograms. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

T1  - The Light Source Metaphor Revisited—Bringing an Old Concept for Teaching Map Projections to the Modern Web.

AB  - Map projections are one of the foundations of geographic information science and cartography. An understanding of the different projection variants and properties is critical when creating maps or carrying out geospatial analyses. The common way of teaching map projections in text books makes use of the light source (or light bulb) metaphor, which draws a comparison between the construction of a map projection and the way light rays travel from the light source to the projection surface. Although conceptually plausible, such explanations were created for the static instructions in textbooks. Modern web technologies may provide a more comprehensive learning experience by allowing the student to interactively explore (in guided or unguided mode) the way map projections can be constructed following the light source metaphor. The implementation of this approach, however, is not trivial as it requires detailed knowledge of map projections and computer graphics. Therefore, this paper describes the underlying computational methods and presents a prototype as an example of how this concept can be applied in practice. The prototype will be integrated into the Geographic Information Technology Training Alliance (GITTA) platform to complement the lesson on map projections. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This is a methodological article describing how a national social work education research project constructed a taxonomy of educational terms and used database and data visualization software to map the social work curriculum in New Zealand. Mapping the curriculum is difficult enough in the context of a single educational program, however, representing and exploring curriculum topics across the 14 different educational institutions participating in this study presented formidable difficulties. This article explores the approach to curriculum mapping used by the research team and discusses the technologies and information science principles used to classify, map, and visualize curriculum content. It will explain how the researchers constructed a taxonomy of over 600 educational terms, describe how the taxonomy was used to index 402 curriculum documents in a relational database, and illustrate the creation of curriculum visualizations using the Tableau™ data visualization software. The way in which findings from this part of the study will inform subsequent phases of the research will be discussed. The strengths and limitations of the methodology will be noted and opportunities to use the assets created by the project for future endeavors identified. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Modeling hyper-dimensional spatial variability is a complex task from both practical and theoretical standpoints. In this paper we develop a method for modeling hyper-dimensional covariance (variogram) structures using the product-sum covariance model initially developed to model spatio-temporal variability. We show that the product-sum model can be used recursively up to an arbitrarily large number of dimensions while preserving relative modeling simplicity and yielding valid covariance models. The method can be used to model variability in anisotropic conditions with multiple axes of anisotropy or when temporal evolution is involved, and thus is applicable to "full anisotropic 3D+time" situations often encountered in environmental sciences. It requires fewer assumptions than the traditional product-sum modeling approach. The new method also presents an alternative to classical approaches to modeling zonal anisotropy and requires fewer parameters to be estimated from data. We present an example by applying the method in conjunction with ordinary kriging to map photosynthetically-active radiation (PAR) for 2006, in Oklahoma, CA, USA and to explore effects of spatio-temporal variability in PAR on gross primary productivity (GPP).

AB  - The intentional omission of learning outcomes from the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education has caused concern and criticism from some librarians; however, the call to action within the Framework to locally develop learning outcomes is an opportunity to illuminate the social justice, critical thinking, and higher order thinking elements of information literacy. This study applies the transformative research paradigm using the methodology of concept mapping to test the development of learning outcomes for one of the frames. Concept mapping is a mixed-methods approach and includes focus groups, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. The methodology has been used extensively in the social sciences but has limited representation in the LIS literature. Though the study provides learning outcomes developed by a small participant group following the concept mapping method, the results demonstrate the viability of this methodology for librarians seeking a new approach to locally develop learning outcomes.

AB  - The Louisiana State University Community Playground Project (LSUCPP) employs community-based design techniques in which college students in biological engineering work with community constituents, especially children, to design and build playgrounds that reflect the unique aspects of the broader community that the playground will serve. In practicing a community-based design process, members of LSUCPP realized that there is a dearth of literature in this area. Therefore, members sought to develop an initial set of community-based design principles and best practices that engineering practitioners can use in their own community-based design endeavors. The team completed brainstorming and concept mapping exercises using a combination of individual and group techniques to create an initial set of 25 community-based design principles. Further discussion and concept mapping resulted in a framework for these 25 principles, which are organized into two major themes, Community-Based Design Principles of Practice, and Community-Based Design Principles of Conduct. The LSUCPP members believe that each of these principles supports the overall goal of community-based design: to express "the Soul of the Community" through co-created artifacts.

AB  - • Concepts in hypothesis testing are related through higher-order mental Processes. • Successful students appeared to have coordinated more Schemas. • Guided questions are suggested based on the results. Hypothesis testing is a prevalent method of inference used to test a claim about a population parameter based on sample data, and it is a central concept in many introductory statistics courses. At the same time, the use of hypothesis testing to interpret experimental data has raised concerns due to common misunderstandings by both scientists and students. With statistics education reform on the rise, as well as an increasing number of students enrolling in introductory statistics courses each year, there is a need for research to investigate students' understanding of hypothesis testing. In this study we used APOS Theory to investigate twelve introductory statistics students' reasoning about one-sample population hypothesis testing while working two real-world problems. Data were analyzed and compared against a preliminary genetic decomposition, which is a conjecture for how an individual might construct an understanding of a concept. This report presents examples of Actions, Processes, and Objects in the context of one-sample hypothesis testing as exhibited through students' reasoning. Our results suggest that the concepts involved in hypothesis testing are related through the construction of higher-order, coordinated Processes operating on Objects. As a result of our data analysis, we propose refinements to our genetic decomposition and offer suggestions for instruction of one-sample population hypothesis testing. We conclude with appendices containing a comprehensive revised genetic decomposition along with a set of guided questions that are designed to help students make the constructions called for by the genetic decomposition.

AB  - Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n = 245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert's referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners' productions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction: National organizations have identified a need for the creation of novel approaches to teach clinical reasoning throughout medical education. The aim of this project was to develop, implement and evaluate a novel clinical reasoning mapping exercise (CResME).Methods: Participants included a convenience sample of first and second year medical students at two US medical schools: University of Central Florida (UCF) and Uniformed Services University of Health Sciences (USUHS). The authors describe the creation and implementation of the CResME. The CResME uses clinical information for multiple disease entities as nodes in different domains (history, physical exam, imaging, laboratory results, etc.), requiring learners to connect these nodes of information in an accurate and meaningful way to develop diagnostic and/or management plans in the process.Results: The majority of medical students at both institutions felt that the CResME promoted their understanding of the differential diagnosis and was a valuable tool to compare and contrast elements of a differential diagnosis. Students at both institutions recommended using the CResME for future sessions.Discussion: The CResME is a promising tool to foster students' clinical reasoning early in medical school. Research is needed on the implementation of the CResME as an instructional and assessment strategy for clinical reasoning throughout medical school training. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - There is a need for research to identify effective implementation strategies for injury prevention training within real‐world community sports. The aim of this ecological participatory study was to identify facilitators, among stakeholders at multiple levels, that could help injury prevention training become part of regular training routines in youth team handball. Concept mapping, a mixed‐method approach for qualitative data collection and quantitative data analysis, was used. Stakeholders (n = 196) of two community team handball clubs (29% players, 13% coaches, 38% caregivers, 11% club, district and national handball administrators, 9% unknown) participated in a brainstorming process. After the research team synthesized the 235 generated statements, 50 stakeholders (34% players, 22% coaches, 24% caregivers, 20% administrators) sorted 89 unique facilitator statements into clusters and rated them for importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis yielded five clusters (stress value 0.231): "Understanding and applying knowledge," "Education, knowledge, and consistency," "Set‐up and exercises," "Inspiration, motivation, and routines," and "Club policy and expert collaboration." The cluster "Understanding and applying knowledge" had the highest mean importance (3.17 out of 4) and feasibility (2.93) ratings. The 32 statements rated as both highly important and feasible (Go‐zone) indicate action is required at the individual (end‐users) and organizational (policymakers) levels to implement injury prevention training. Results suggest that developing evidence‐based context‐specific injury prevention training, incorporating physiological, biomechanical and psychological components, and an associated context‐specific implementation plan in partnership with all stakeholders should be a high priority to facilitate the implementation of injury prevention training in youth team handball.

The concept of open science and new models of scholarly communication are considered. Approach/Methods: Related studies of information infrastructure and information behavior of researchers are analyzed. We report on the results of a series of qualitative studies of information behavior and of information ecology of the academic environment in Slovakia based on interviews with doctoral students, expert researchers and information managers. We apply a previously developed original methodology of concept mapping. Results and conclusions: The results allow us to re-consider relevance assessment in the digital environment and to present a model of the information ecology in the information environment. We present the analyzed data represented by the concept maps which show the attitudes of researchers to open science, economic models of science and values of researchers. The final model of academic information ecologies is explained, and a new interactive model of the academic library is presented. Practical implications: We suggest the implications for the development of information science and for the education of information professionals. Originality/Value: Original models emphasize values of academic research, values of information, value-added services of academic libraries, and value-sensitive design of digital libraries.

AB  - Abstract Concept mapping was used to identify the needs of nonkinship foster parents from Caucasian ethnicity who care for unaccompanied refugee minors (URM) in Flanders (Dutch speaking part of Belgium). Nonkinship foster parents (n = 30) described their needs in response of the question: "What do you need to be a good foster parent for the unaccompanied refugee minor(s)?" Next, 50 unique responses were sorted by 15 foster mothers, and analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. Furthermore, foster mothers indicated the degree of importance of each statement. Fifty unique responses were grouped into eight clusters. In descending order of importance these clusters referred to parenting skills and a good fit of the URM into the foster family, good parenting conditions and personal skills, a tolerant society and information about options for reunification, support for the URM and certainty about the future, information on and open attitude for the background and friends of the URM, preparation of the URM and reassuring contacts with the biological family and others, support and fellow contacts for foster parents, and support from the context. Their needs resemble the needs of normal foster parents, with the exception of some specific needs, such as the preparation of URM for the placement, information about the options for reunification and certainty about the future, experienced foster care workers, specialized psychological support related to trauma, openness to and information about culture, religion and language. Highlights • Foster parents who care for unaccompanied refugee minors have specific needs. • Unaccompanied refugee minors should be well prepared for placement in foster care. • Placement success is associated with flexible cultural adaptation. • Specialized services are needed to support foster parents of unaccompanied minors.

AB  - The increasing availability of high quality remotely sensed data has resulted in its inclusion in a variety of research disciplines, allowing for a greater spatial understanding of processes and landforms in different environments. Within glacial sedimentology and geomorphology, the use of remotely sensed data such as digital elevation models (DEM) has increased knowledge on the distribution of glacial landforms, e.g. drumlins, and the variety of morphologies that these landforms can encompass. Despite the potential of these data types there are many limitations that can impact the interpretations and conclusions associated with them. The use of digital elevation models, hillshade imagery and aerial imagery in glacial geomorphology was introduced into a fourth year "Glacial sediments and Environments" earth science class. Students were provided a set of data covering a portion of a drumlin field found in southern Ontario, Canada which included a 10 m DEM, multiple hillshades with different azimuth and satellite imagery. After an introduction to drumlin morphology, identification and formation each student was asked to identify and manually digitize the drumlins within the study area using ArcGIS. The purpose of this assignment was: to introduce students to different types of remotely sensed data, the benefits and the limitations; to critically assess the geomorphology of a given region and provide interpretation; to provide insight into the variability of landforms and the tendency to differ from the idealized description; and to exemplify the impact of user interpretation in manually mapped geomorphological studies. Five years of this assignment has produced over 100 examples of maps of the interpreted drumlin field. Each year, the maps are compiled to help students visualize the impact of user interpretation on landform delineation. This assignment provides a basis of understanding for the rest of the course as glacial environments and glacial geomorphological features are explored. For example, in a later assignment focusing on the varied theories of drumlin formation the students use their experience with landform mapping to inform how they reflect on and interpret the analysis in the research articles. In general, students have enjoyed the activity as it provides an opportunity to work with real world data, to understand a type of landform mapping and introduces concepts that they explore throughout the semester.

AB  - Reconstruction of highly-resolved Digital Outcrop Model (DOM) using Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry is a low-cost but very effective method to explore and study remote planetary outcrops. Extensive data gathered by Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) rover Curiosity can be used to produce models of specific outcrops visited by the rover in the Gale Crater, on Mars. Integration into a Virtual Reality (VR) environment of these DOM enables one or several users to experience a reliable and realistic depiction of the actual geometries of the geological features, which is usually prevented by classic viewing methods on computer screens. Also, use of a VR environment authorizes the observation at real scale of various sedimentary series, structures and objects present at an outcrop, the same way they would on a real field. Moreover, this practice allows for a very precise and accurate characterization, description and therefore mapping of the features, as well as the contextualization of the sampling and remote analyses underwent by the Curiosity rover within their geological setting (e.g. ChemCam Laser-Induced Breakdown Spectrometer and Remote Micro-Imager data). Here, we focus on the Kimberley outcrop, traversed by Curiosity in 2014 between martian sols 603 and 630. This section presents a sedimentary succession with unusually high potassic content (Le Deit et al., JGR-Planets, 2016). However, poorly constrained stratigraphic relations between the series of the Kimberley Formation and its local to regional surroundings prevent further understanding of the exact extent of these accumulations and their significance within the broader Gale Crater paleoenvironmental scheme. Such questions highlight the need for a new finer mapping of, first, the outcrop itself to notably achieve precise characterization at the cm-scale of the Mount Remarkable butte; and then of the various structures present in the immediate vicinity of the outcrop. We therefore propose to use a custom true color highly resolved (up to the mm-scale) DOM of the Kimberley outcrop integrated into a VR environment to achieve precise and accurate mapping of the area and of the different geomorphological and sedimentological features (beds, structures and contacts alike). This represents a first step toward a better understanding of the intra- and inter-formational relations of the Kimberley series.We acknowledge the EU H2020 PlanMap project for supporting this work.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the best methods in creating virtual field trips to aid and enhance the learning experience for first year students who are generally unfamiliar with the subject of Geology, since this is not taught in our schools. The Department of Earth Science offers its first-year Earth Science course to a large number of students. This large class size places strain on the departmental human resources and makes teaching effective field-based practicals a labour-intensive and ineffective process, as too many people are needed to instruct the students adequately in the field. This has led to the need to find innovative ways to improve the efficacy of the essential field-based learning process. Advances in virtual environments and reality augmentations, as well as their realized potential to facilitate learning through blended learning, make the generation of virtual field trips a viable addition to the traditional real-world field trips. To create these virtual outcrops, high definition, panoramic images of outcrops are produced for overview purposes, with high-resolution detail images that can be viewed stereoscopically in a Highly Immersive Visualization Environment (HIVE) on a 6x3 meter screen. Close-up images of key features are incorporated to highlight key features for closer investigation, progressing to detailed images of hand-specimen and from there thin sections where appropriate. These images are set up in such a way that it becomes a virtual and interactive tour of the various features that students are able to access wherever they have a reliable internet connection. The analytical framework for the project is based on geology education literature which uses an expert/novice perspective to examine the development of students' understanding of geological concepts. By looking into the reasoning processes of the students, the virtual environment can be designed so as to enhance the students' ability to interpret geological rock types and features.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to investigate the knowledge, attitude and behaviour of foundation chemistry learners concerning the sustainable development concept.Design/methodology/approach Qualitative and quantitative studies were conducted. Atlas.ti software was used to analyse the chemistry curriculum based on selected themes and sub-themes. A survey was carried out involving 132 chemistry learners. The chemistry learners were students from a foundation programme in a local university located in Selangor, Malaysia. The collected data were analysed using SPSS 21.0 involving descriptive and inferential statistics.Findings Document analysis on the chemistry curriculum shows that water is the theme most covered in the chemistry learners' textbook, as compared to other themes. In general, the chemistry learners have good knowledge and attitude concerning the sustainable development concept. However, their knowledge and attitude do not reflect in their behaviour as an individual, as well as in the classroom. Moreover, their knowledge, attitude and behaviour focus more on environmental dimension, as compared to other sustainable development dimensions.Practical implications This paper is instrumental in assisting educators to assess how chemistry learners perceive sustainable development, and this may help to bring about changes to improve chemistry teaching and learning processes towards education for sustainable development.Originality/value This paper is an original and novel research paper which is first conducted on sustainable development concept in chemistry curriculum in Malaysia.

AB  - The need for all students to develop a stronger ability to express their science knowledge in writing is important. In this article, the authors take you on a journey in an elementary school classroom with tools to help foster deeper learning and stronger writing skills in science content. With many students in high school required to pass end-of-semester science exams to receive a diploma, teaching writing at an early age across various content areas is an even more critical component of today's curriculum. Presenting curriculum material through multiple means (Universal Design for Learning-Representation) allows students to gain information through a learning approach that best fits the students' learning needs. The authors examine multiple means of representing science curriculum to engage students in creating detailed and comprehensive concept maps and to provide supportive scientific evidence in written explanations as they gain more content knowledge in science.

AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students' understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - As a professor teaching general core science courses to non-science majors, I designed a learner-centered, inquiry-based course in order to potentially positively influence science-related attitudes of my students. Through the lens of action research with mixed methodology, I analyzed student attitudes regarding science through the Test of Science-Related Attitudes (TOSRA) and a deductive coding strategy on student narratives obtained throughout the course. A two-tailed t-test determined a significant increase in three of the categories (Social Implications of Science, Normality of Scientists, and Enjoyment of Science Lessons) and decrease in two of the categories (Attitude to Scientific Inquiry and Career Interest in Science). The coded narratives correlated with the increased categories, provided valuable rationale for the decrease in the Attitude to Scientific Inquiry and demonstrated effective use of academic language concerning science. The protocol showed students' ability to achieve a greater conceptual understanding of science along with its impact on their careers and personal decisions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Knowledge and motivation of a teacher are two unchallenged, essential characteristics for successful education. Whilst the relevance of teachers’ professional knowledge for successful students’ learning has been studied in a sophisticated manner for years, the meaning of teachers’ motivational orientations for students’ performance still lacks a differentiated consideration. This construct is conceptualized by three domains: (1) self-efficacy, (2) subject-specific enthusiasm, and (3) enthusiasm for teaching the subject. Motivational orientations overall have shown to be relevant predictors of students’ learning. However, there are several dimensions of motivation and their relative importance remains unclear. Our study goes beyond the available findings by considering in detail each of the three domains’ relations to students’ performance. Thus, we aim to further contribute to the clarification of the predictors of students’ performance in school teaching. For this purpose, we conducted a study with 48 biology teachers and their 1036 students. To assess the three domains of teachers’ motivational orientations, we applied paper and pencil tests. Concept maps and paper and pencil tests were used to measure students’ performance. By specifying multilevel structural equation models, we examined the relationship between the domains of teachers’ motivational orientations and the performance of the students. Our results reveal no relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ performance, but a significant positive relationship between the latter and teachers’ subject-specific enthusiasm. Moreover, our results show a positive trend in the relationship between enthusiasm for teaching the subject and students’ performance. The results provide a differentiated picture about the importance of motivational orientations for the characterisation of an effective teacher. We discuss our findings in terms of possible effect mechanisms and their relevance for further research on teacher motivation and the improvement of teacher education programmes.

AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop problem-based learning and concept mapping by using a block-based programming model (PBL-CBp model) and to evaluate the appropriateness of the PBL-CBp model. The research will be divided into two parts. The first part will be about learning style development and will study the theories and ideas which relate to problem-based learning, the programming process and the concept mapping and block-based programming. It will synthesise the steps in the problem-based learning method, and the steps in the program process and design the learning steps by using problem-based concept mapping and block-based programming. The second part will consist of an evaluation of the appropriateness of the model. An appropriateness questionnaire for the PBL-CBp model will be created and the PBL-CBp model will be submitted to five experts for improvement. After evaluation of the appropriateness of the PBL-CBp model, the experts found taht the overall view was that it was 'very good' (x=4.71, S.D.=0.49), that the input part was also 'very good'(x=4.58, S.D.=0.55), as was the learning process (x=4.85, S.D.=0.40). The evaluation was 'good'(x=4.30, S.D.=0.48) and the feedback was 'very good' (x=4.80, S.D.=0.42). The results show that this PBL-CBp model could be used to enhance the programming competency of undergraduate students in computer science. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and aim:  Universal smoking cessation strategies are not always successful for minorities, among whom smoking is highly prevalent despite high intention to quit. This study identifies facilitators for smoking cessation, as perceived by minority male smokers, that can inform a culturally appropriate national plan for smoking prevention and cessation. Methods:  We conducted in 2013 a three-stage study among Arab minority male current and former smokers (ages 18–64) in Israel, among whom smoking is very high: first, a Concept Mapping (CM) study with 102 and 202 participants in the brainstorming, and sorting and rating phases respectively. Second, we assigned clusters identified in the CM study to contingency levels using the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM). Third, we classified clusters into intervention functions and policies using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW). Findings:  The CM study revealed 58 barriers and facilitators for smoking prevention and cessation that were sorted into 11 clusters by the participants. These clusters were analogous to four BEM level contingency of smoking (social, institutional, community and individual). We classified it into two main policy categories, based on the BCW: 1- restructuring the socio-political environment of smoking through affirmative government's policies towards Arab minority in Israel, and 2-developing a culturally appropriate plan for smoking cessation in Arab local authorities including: raising awareness about tobacco hazards; enforcing anti-smoking laws; strengthening community institutional action; providing smoking cessation services; considering raising prices for tobacco products, addressing psychological sources of smoking in Arab men. Conclusions:  Our study revealed barriers, facilitators and contingencies of smoking prevention and cessation with two main policy action items among the Arab minority in Israel: changing the socio-political environment of smoking, and developing a culturally appropriate smoking prevention and cessation national plan. Our study framework can inform policies and culturally appropriate interventions for smoking prevention and cessation in other minorities. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background:  Clinical reasoning is an important topic in healthcare training, assessment, and research. Virtual patients (VPs) are a safe environment to teach, assess and perform research on clinical reasoning and diagnostic accuracy. Our aim was to explore the details of the clinical reasoning process and diagnostic accuracy of undergraduate medical students when working with VPs using a concept mapping tool. Methods:  Over seven months we provided access to 67 German and 30 English VPs combined with a concept mapping tool to visualize and measure the clinical reasoning process of identifying problems, differential diagnoses, recommended tests and treatment options, and composing a summary statement about a VP. A final diagnosis had to be submitted by the learners in order to conclude the VP scenario. Learners were allowed multiple attempts or could request the correct diagnosis from the system. Results:  We analyzed 1,393 completed concept maps from 317 learners. We found significant differences between maps with a correct final diagnosis on one or multiple attempts and maps in which learners gave up and requested the solution from the system. These maps had lower scores, fewer summary statements, and fewer problems, differential diagnoses, tests, and treatments. Conclusions:  The different use patterns and scores between learners who had the correct final diagnosis on one or multiple attempts and those who gave up, indicate that diagnostic accuracy in the form of a correct final diagnosis on the first attempt has to be reconsidered as a sole indicator for clinical reasoning competency. For the training, assessment, and research of clinical reasoning we suggest focusing more on the details of the process to reach a correct diagnosis, rather than whether it was made in the first attempt.

AB  - In this work, we discuss transformations in the meaning of the concept of mass, which are important to physics teaching, by means of three conceptual schemes, which emphasize visual patterns of knowledge organization. We begin by discussing how the meaning of a physical concept is constructed, through its relations with others. In physical theories, these connections usually involve mathematical operations. We focus on the concept of mass and its changes in three different contexts, namely classical mechanics, electromagnetism and relativity. Modifications are displayed as shifts in its relative position in conceptual schemes. These schemes enforce visual knowledge and may be used as didactical tools for teaching the subject, since they stress both the signification of mass in classical mechanics and its re-signification in relativity. This paves the way for a discussion of different approaches adopted for teaching the mass-energy relation in relativity, expressed by the famous formula E = mc2. As the terms rest mass, relativistic mass and invariant mass, which have different ontological and epistemological contents, are part of this discussion, we consider the main approaches to mass present in both relativity textbooks and discourses by some influential physicists.

AB  - Concept mapping is an important tool used in science learning to help students construct understanding about fundamental concepts and how they are related. The EcoXPT research project has the goal of supporting authentic experiment-based inquiry within an immersive virtual world curriculum for middle school ecosystem science. It builds on prior research with the EcoMUVE curriculum, which includes, as a culminating activity, student teams creating hand-drawn concept maps to represent their hypotheses about the causal relationships in a virtual ecosystem. As part of the initial Design-Based Research phase of EcoXPT, researchers developed a new electronic concept mapping tool which was piloted with the EcoMUVE curriculum. This study looks at differences in concept maps drawn by student teams based on whether they were given access to the new concept-mapping tool. The findings provide insight into the impact of concept map scaffolding choices, and inform the design of future versions of the tool. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Griggs et al. (2013) redefine sustainable development as "development that meets the needs of the present while safeguarding Earth's life-support system, on which the welfare of current and future generations depend." We recommend this as the end goal that the United Nations sustainable development goals (SDGs) should strive to achieve. Integration across the SDGs is less than what is required from a science perspective. Effective implementation of the SDGs will require States to attend to trade-offs and overlaps. We argue that continuous failure to address integration within the SDGs will jeopardize realization of this ultimate end goal. Therefore, we adopt a systems approach to identify gaps and connections across the goals and targets of the SDGs as well as leverage points for effective intervention. We triangulate across methods of critical analysis, conceptual modeling, and keyword network analysis to draw out seven "overarching directions" that could provide a prioritization framework to enhance efficient implementation of the SDGs. Our results identify main gaps as exclusion of key actors (e.g., corporations) and issues (e.g., intergenerational equity and population); inadequate reconciliation of economic growth with maintaining the Earth system; and deficient consideration of the relationship with international law. Conceptual mapping identifies education and innovation; governance and implementation; sustainable consumption and production; and addressing the key drivers of climate change as key leverage points. The keyword analysis highlights greater integration within the SDGs than what appears at face value. Keywords "access," "women," "resources," and "finance" feature across the SDGs and provide further leverage points. Targeting these issues will facilitate realization of a high proportion of SDGs and correspondingly could have a disproportional impact on effective SDG implementation. We conclude that the success of the SDGs needs to be evaluated by the extent to which it contributes to human development while advancing protection of "planetary must-haves" for current and future generations.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review.Design/methodology/approach A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability.Findings Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach.Research limitations/implications Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students.Practical implications By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making.Social implications The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration.Originality/value This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

AB  - Semantic web technologies are not focus intrinsically to the terms describing a scientific field but extend further towards meaningful relationships, a task that in traditional systems of knowledge representation is allocated to humans. In a standard approach the most valuable tool in the study and comprehension of a scientific disciple is the concept map. This map is a well-structured and classifiable graph that represents scientific information optically. Evolution of this representation in the knowledge organization systems are the Topic Maps. In Topic Maps the different concepts are hierarchical and relational connected in a virtual map, while URIs ensure the interoperability of this form of ontology. Topic Maps allow to the developer a high degree of expressiveness, especially in the case of multidimensional relationships. Herein, we generated a Topic Map for the Cardiology field, using a minimum but sufficient set of terms to cover almost 70% of cardiovascular terminology. Cardiology is in focus because the cardiological disorders remain the first cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, while the available semantic description systems for this field are limited. We build an experimental cardiological ontology by utilizing XAMPP, Topincs, Wandora and Ontopia as developmental tools. The resulting map is currently under evaluation and enrichment to include in addition to the clinical entities, cell biology, implantable instruments, and pharmaceuticals. We anticipate that in future this tool would be a valuable addition in information science and cardiology which will assist both clinical and experimental scientists. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners’ knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners’ knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction: Medical education today, encourages modification of traditional didactic lectures with innovations to promote active learning strategies to enhance integration of knowledge and critical thinking skills among students. Learning independently is challenging in year 1 of the undergraduate medical curriculum. However, defining the learning goals clearly by the instructor to the students will make them appreciate it and mould them into successful learners with deep approach. Aim: To enhance self-directed learning skills and to promote concept mapping ability to integrate the study of various metabolic functions and fundamental concepts in biochemistry. Materials and Methods: First year MBBS Student volunteers (n=127) in their second semester having an experience of over 30 weeks of learning biochemistry in an integrated system-wise approach were involved in this study. They were exposed to a self-directed active learning strategy for a period of 10 weeks, for linking important biochemical terms from the current learning objectives to various concepts and topics learnt earlier in the year. Student’s perspective regarding the above activity was documented by obtaining their responses in a closed ended questionnaire using Likert scale and was expressed as percentage. Results: Majority of the students (n=100, 79%) opined that it was a unique way of learning biochemistry and that they (n=111, 87%) were required to read up previous portions. Many students (n=100, 79%) felt that it made them more than mere rote learners and were able to integrate biochemistry topics more efficiently (n=109, 86%). Many students also felt that it helped them to improve their test scores (n=79, 62%). Conclusion: Active participation in the current study has made them learn the concept building skills in biochemistry and has proved to be an effective exercise of revisit to topics learnt throughout the year. Innovative curriculum delivery strategies should be designed to teach preclinical subjects in a medical school so that they shall infuse integrated learning approach in students. Concept building activities in a lecture set up shall generate curiosity in the process of learning and transform students into deep approach learners. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills.

AB  - Purpose This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review.Design/methodology/approach A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability.Findings Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach.Research limitations/implications Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students.Practical implications By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making.Social implications The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration.Originality/value This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

AB  - A wide range of opinions exist regarding the science of social work, yielding a challenging discourse to navigate in its entirety. Yet understanding the diverse perspectives and contributions is critical for doctoral students of social work. This teaching note describes the use of concept mapping as a pedagogical method employed by a class of doctoral students and their instructor to articulate the various points of view expressed in the recent literature. We begin with a brief overview of concept mapping, followed by a description of our four-stage methodology. This teaching note offers a brief conclusion that remarks on the value of the exercise and its potential in social work education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (<italic>n</italic> = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (<italic>g</italic> = 0.58, <italic>p</italic> < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (<italic>g</italic> = 0.72, <italic>p</italic> < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (<italic>g</italic> = 0.43, <italic>p</italic> < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Summary: The present study aimed to enrich the scientific evidence on obesity prevention programmes for adolescents from socio‐economically disadvantaged backgrounds with practice‐based experiences from both scientific and professional experts in the field of youth obesity prevention. We used the participatory method of concept mapping. Two concept mapping sessions were conducted: one with programme coordinators of national/regional obesity prevention programmes across Europe (n = 8) and one with scientists participating in European obesity prevention projects (n = 5). Five recommendations were extracted from both concept maps: (1) involve adolescents in the design and delivery of the programme, (2) invest in family/parental capacity building, (3) provide and support a healthy school food and physical activity environment, (4) regulate exposure to unhealthy messages/advertising and (5) facilitate safe and active travel. These recommendations can be used as a conceptual framework for programme development for preventing obesity in adolescents. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In recent decades, internationalization within higher education has emerged as a distinct field for practice and research. However, there are few meta-analyses of how the research trends and foci of this topic have evolved and shifted over time. This article analyzes the content of the Journal of Studies in International Education (JSIE), a central outlet for internationalization research, thus shedding light on overarching developments and trends within the field. In this investigation, the text-mining tool Leximancer™ is used to generate concept maps based on the titles and abstracts of all 406 scientific articles published in the JSIE between 1997 and 2016 (first issue). Four major developmental waves in this research area are revealed: delineation of the field (1997-2001), institutionalization and management of internationalization (2002-2006), consequences of internationalization: student needs and support structures (2007-2011), and currently, moving from the institutional to the transnational context of internationalization (2012-2016). The results show how the meaning of the concept has evolved to encapsulate several other related concepts in research on higher education, while reporting practices toward internationalization at individual, institutional, and national levels.

AB  - The Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathic Personality (CAPP) is a concept map of psychopathic personality disorder (PPD). The CAPP- Institutional Rating Scale (IRS) is a tool designed to assess CAPP symptoms in institutional settings. The CAPP contains 33 personality traits organized in six domains: attachment, behavioural, cognitive, dominance, emotional and self. Until now, much of the CAPP research has been conducted out of clinical, forensic and correctional settings using self-ratings. In the current study, the psychometric properties and construct validity of the CAPP-IRS were evaluated in a non-convenience sample of 204 Spanish convicts. Clinician ratings were employed. Participants had been imprisoned for at least 6 months at Pereiro de Aguiar Penitentiary. This group of inmates was heterogeneous with respect to type of official charges, and representative as all convicts interned for at least 6 months in this prison were screened for participation. Classical test theory indexes of reliability, correlations between CAPP items and domains and external correlations and structural analyses demonstrated that CAPP assessment is a solid and robust way of evaluating psychopathy in a correctional setting. Best fit was found for a three-factor model: attachment and emotional items associated with a callous and unemotional trait, dominance and self items associated with a pathological interpersonal style, and behavioural and residual items from other domains associated with impulsivity.

AB  - Although concept mapping remains widely used in education, there is little research showing how best to teach it. We investigated if practice, feedback, and knowledge of relational framing help improve students' concept mapping skills over time. Four online graduate courses at two universities were randomly assigned to one of two teaching conditions: a traditional concept map teaching strategy or traditional plus relational framing teaching strategy. Students in each course created three concept maps over three weeks following repeated instruction and instructor feedback. Repeated practice and feedback improved the structural quality of students' concept maps, as well as the number of autobiographical elaborations within those maps. Teaching strategy moderated the effect of practice and feedback on the relational quality of students' maps. Relational scores in relational framing groups improved over time, whereas those in the traditional groups remained unchanged. Implications for teaching concept mapping are discussed.

T1  - A mathematical evaluation for measuring correctness of domain ontologies using concept maps.

AB  - There is a need for further research in the area of ontology evaluation specifically dealing with ontology development exploiting concept maps. The existing literature on ontology evaluation primarily emphasis on ontology formalisation as well as on performing logical inferences, which is usually not directly relevant for concept maps as they are commonly exploited as communication instruments for learning purposes. Commonly used techniques for evaluating concept maps for knowledge assessment may be adopted for a kind of criteria-based evaluation of a domain concept map with respect to a particular aspect. However, this makes its validity limited to a particular aspect or criteria. This paper presents a mathematical ontology evaluation technique to measure the correctness of domain ontologies engineered using concept maps. It is based on the notion of merging two different mathematical measures, namely closeness index and similarity index to come up with a combined index that takes different criteria or aspects into account while performing ontology evaluation. Therefore, the proposed technique makes the evaluation process more reliable and robust. Two case studies were conducted employing the proposed technique for evaluating two different domain ontologies that were engineered using concept maps. Calculations and results from the case studies showed that depending on the correctness of individual ontology, different values of combined Index was calculated manifesting the measure of correctness of each individual ontology in a quantifiable form. Moreover, the results depict that the technique provides in-depth evaluation, it is easy to adopt, requires no special skills, and is conveniently replicable. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Articles from three landmark symposia on theory for nursing--published in Nursing Research in 1968-1969--served as a key underpinning for the development of nursing as an academic discipline. The current special issue on Theory and Theorizing in Nursing Science celebrates the 50th anniversary of publication of these seminal works in nursing theory. Objective: The purpose of this commentary is to consider the future of nursing theory development in light of articles published in the anniversary issue. Approach: The Editorial Team for the special issue identified core questions about continued nursing theory development, as related to the nursing metaparadigm, practice theory, big data, and doctoral education. Using a dialogue format, the editors discussed these core questions. Discussion: The classic nursing metaparadigm(health, person, environment, nursing) was viewed as a continuing unifying element for the discipline but is in need of revision in today's scientific and practice climates. Practice theory and precision healthcare jointly arise from an emphasis on individualization. Big data and the methods of e-science are challenging the assumptions on which nursing theory development was originally based. Doctoral education for nursing scholarship requires changes to ensure that tomorrow's scholars are prepared to steward the discipline by advancing (not reifying) past approaches to nursing theory. Conclusion: Ongoing reexamination of theory is needed to clarify the domain of nursing, guide nursing science and practice, and direct and communicate the unique and essential contributions of nursing science to the broader health research effort and of nursing to healthcare.

AB  - The Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) was designed to advance understanding of complex oceanographic processes by acquiring large quantities of data at six key locations in the world ocean. The OOI Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization has built an educational cyberinfrastructure and developed interactive tools targeted for undergraduate-level learners that enable easy access to OOI data, images, and video. To develop the suite of OOI education tools, EPE used an iterative design process, including needs assessment, tool prototyping, and usability testing in undergraduate classrooms. Data visualization and concept mapping tools were envisioned as a way to help undergraduates link concepts students see in oceanography textbooks to real-world phenomena. A Data Investigation Builder (DIB) was constructed to assist professors in designing data activities. During the usability testing, professors provided valuable feedback that allowed EPE to improve the tools. Based on the lessons learned from EPE, in 2016 we developed a new prototype set of Data Explorations that were more modular and easier to integrate into an undergraduate lecture or problem set. This paper reviews how the EPE toolset was developed, including establishment of requirements for the tools and incorporation of lessons learned from the user needs assessment and the results of usability testing of prototype tools.

AB  - Introduction: Sport management is a relatively young and fast-growing academic discipline. Through the dedication of scholars, the field has matured into a distinctive discipline in recent years. Meanwhile, many Asian scholars collaborated to organize the Asian Association for Sport management (AASM), an association created with the purpose of bringing together academics in the field of sport management to not only promote but also carry out practical research. In order to gain a better understanding of the evolution of sport management research in Asia, the purpose of this study was to map out the sport management research landscape in Taiwan and Korea. Methods: Leximancer (a text-mining tool for visualizing the structure of concepts and themes in the text) was used by analyzing data from articles published in the Journal of Taiwan Society for Sport Management (from 2002 to 2017) and the Korean Journal of Sport Management (from 1996 to 2017). These two journals were selected due to their relatively long histories of publication and their large volumes of articles, which allow for more thorough and accurate analyses of trends and themes in these two nations. Results: Between the two journals, the themes "Sport" and "Satisfaction" were shared. However, Taiwanese studies in sport management placed more emphasis on the themes "Leisure" and "Education," while studies in Korea concentrated on "Professional" subjects. Taiwan studies also moved from a physical education focus toward participant experience in leisure activities, sporting events, and sports strategies over time. On the other hand, earlier studies in Korea focused more on the development of the sports industry and strategies to promote public sports, while recent articles emphasize sport participants' and spectators' behavior by empirically examining the relationship between variables such as satisfaction, service quality, value, brand image, attitude, and behavior. Conclusion: This study firstly examined and compared the sport management literature between Asian countries. The findings provide a better understanding of different patterns and trends of sport management research in Taiwan and Korea. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Given that parents are the main carriers of change in their child, their participation in programs for preventing behavior problems in early childhood represents a key element in ensuring the success of the intervention. That said, although at-risk families benefit the most from this type of program, they are identified as being hard to reach. This study aims at identifying the factors that influence parent recruitment based on the points of view of the actors concerned. To this end, a concept mapping operation was performed, which involved parents ( n = 19), practitioners (n = 19), and administrators ( n = 13) from community and public organizations. The participants generated 131 statements to complete the following sentence: In your opinion , parents would enroll more in prevention activities for their child if…. These 131 statements were classified into 12 groups representing the factors that influence parent recruitment, all of which were considered relatively important (between 3.51 and 4.42 on 5). The participants also agree on an understanding of recruitment that tends toward an ecological model. This study shows that parent recruitment into prevention programs targeting behavior problems in early childhood is complex and multifactorial (including factors that concern parents, practitioners, services, organizations, and policies). Because the map shows that the influencing factors in recruitment appear to be interrelated, they should all be considered to increase the chances of reaching at-risk families.

AB  - Scaffolds in games have the potential to facilitate learning effects in addition to assisting the gaming process. However, studies on game-based science learning usually only adopt questionnaires to evaluate scientific concepts, and use interviews or observations to assess problem solving ability, neglecting the importance of investigating game-making outcomes. We customized a digital game, “Crayon Physics Deluxe,” with varied scaffolding designs to evaluate their effects on science learning. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, marking critical features scaffolding, and the no-game group. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and design creativity (in the form of game episode designs). Students were asked to transform their roles from problem solvers to problem designers, which might not only demonstrate their ability to solve scientific problems, but also develop their creativity potential in designing scientific puzzles. The results indicated that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and the sensitivity dimension of design creativity, while the group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of design creativity. These findings suggest that proper scaffolds could be designed to function as learning scaffolds rather than just as gaming scaffolds, and different learning purposes require various scaffolding designs. The content of the scaffolds, as well as the timing of their provision should be carefully designed according to the game features to achieve specific instructional purposes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background Researchers have established the benefits of school gardens on students’ academic achievement, dietary outcomes, physical activity, and psychosocial skills, yet limited research has been conducted about how school gardens become institutionalized and sustained. Objective Our aim was to develop a tool that captures how gardens are effectively established, integrated, and sustained in schools. Design We conducted a sequential, exploratory, mixed-methods study. Participants were identified with the help of Grow To Learn, the organization coordinating the New York City school garden initiative, and recruited via e-mail. Participants/setting A stratified, purposeful sample of 21 New York City elementary and middle schools participated in this study throughout the 2013/2014 school year. The sample was stratified in their garden budgets and purposeful in that each of the schools’ gardens were determined to be well integrated and sustained. Main outcome measures The processes and strategies used by school gardeners to establish well-integrated school gardens were assessed via data collected from surveys, interviews, observations, and concept mapping. Statistical analyses performed Descriptive statistics as well as multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to examine the survey and concept mapping data. Qualitative data analysis consisted of thematic coding, pattern matching, explanation building and cross-case synthesis. Results Nineteen components within four domains of school garden integration were found through the mixed-methods concept mapping analysis. When the analyses of other data were combined, relationships between domains and components emerged. These data resulted in the development of the GREEN (Garden Resources, Education, and Environment Nexus) Tool. Conclusions When schools with integrated and sustained gardens were studied, patterns emerged about how gardeners achieve institutionalization through different combinations of critical components. These patterns are best described by the GREEN Tool, the first framework to identify how to operationalize school gardening components and describe an evidence-based strategy of successful school garden integration.

AB  - <bold>Background: </bold>The critical shortage of human resources in health is a critical public health problem affecting most low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to the shortage of health professionals, attracting and retaining them in rural areas is a challenge. The objective of the study was to understand the factors that influence the attraction and retention of health professionals working in rural areas in Niger.<bold>Methods: </bold>A mixed-method study was conducted in Tillabery region, Niger. A conceptual framework was used that included five dimensions. Three data collection methods were employed: in-depth interviews, documentary analysis, and concept mapping. In-depth interviews were conducted with three main actor groups: policy-makers and Ministry of Health officials (n = 15), health professionals (n = 102), and local health managers (n = 46). Concept mapping was conducted with midwifery students (n = 29). Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were performed to analyse the data from the concept mapping method. A content analysis was conducted for the qualitative data.<bold>Results: </bold>The results of the study showed that the local environment, which includes living conditions (no electricity, lack of availability of schools), social factors (isolation, national and local insecurity), working conditions (workload), the lack of financial compensation, and individual factors (marital status, gender), influences the attraction and retention of health professionals to work in rural areas. Human resources policies do not adequately take into account the factors influencing the retention of rural health professionals.<bold>Conclusion: </bold>Intersectoral policies are needed to improve living conditions and public services in rural areas. The government should also take into account the feminization of the medical profession and the social and cultural norms related to marital status and population mobility when formulating human resources management policies.

AB  - This paper describes the development, implementation, and students' perceptions of a new trilayer approach of teaching (TLAT). The TLAT model involved blending lecture, in-class group activities, and out-of-class assignments on selected content areas and was implemented initially in a first-year integrated pharmacy course. Course contents were either delivered by traditional lectures or by the TLAT. A survey instrument was distributed by SurveyMonkey to determine students' perceptions of the TLAT model. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Students' performance in a total of 225 examination and quiz questions was analyzed to evaluate whether the TLAT model improved students' learning. Students' (n = 98) performance scores for TLAT-based and lecture-based questions were 83.3 ± 10.2 and 79.5 ± 14.0, respectively (P < 0.05). Ninety-three percent of students believed that in-class group activities enhanced conceptual understanding of course materials, helped them take responsibility of their own learning, and enhanced their overall learning experiences. More than 80% of respondents felt that solving cases and developing concept maps helped them sharpen creative and critical thinking skills. In addition, 90% of the respondents indicated that the homework throughout the semester helped them stay up to date and focused with the progress of the course. The use of the TLAT model led to an improvement in student learning of complex concepts. Moreover, the results suggest that this model improves students' self-reliance and attitudes toward learning. Our findings should serve as an impetus for inclusion of diverse active learning strategies in pharmacy education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this activity is to demonstrate science teaching and assessing what is learned via using concept maps. Concept mapping is a technique for visually representing the structure of information. Concept mapping allows students to understand the relationships between concepts of science by creating a visual map of the connections. Concept map have been used in science to promote meaningful learning and effective teaching. It can be used by students as a study tool or by teachers to evaluate students understanding of science and to enhance science teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Although concept-based curricula are frequently discussed in the nursing education literature, little information exists to guide the development of a concept-based pharmacology course. Traditionally, nursing pharmacology courses are taught with an emphasis on drug class where a prototype drug serves as an exemplar. When transitioning pharmacology to a concept-based course, special considerations are in order. How can educators successfully integrate essential pharmacological content into a curriculum structured around nursing concepts? This article presents one approach to the design and implementation of a concept-based undergraduate pharmacology course. Planning methods, supportive teaching strategies, and course evaluation procedures are discussed [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Online discussions have become inherent components of both face-to-face and distance education college courses, yet they often fail to provide much benefit to students' learning outcomes. One reason behind this phenomenon is the lack of or inadequate scaffolding or guidance provided to students when participating on asynchronous discussion boards. Although some existing tools and strategies may encourage meaningful academic discussions by eliciting conflict among students, scientific concepts do not always lend themselves to such discourse. Instead, collaborative activities in the area of science need to incorporate the co-critiquing of a flawed external source, with appropriate scaffolding to also benefit students with low self-regulation levels by mediating cognitive and metacognitive processes. The authors designed and tested such a tool, termed Collaborative Misconception Mapping (CMM), which combines the positive effects of concept mapping and the Questioning the Author comprehension strategy. Compared with a discussion-questions based online activity, the use of the online CMM strategy lead to more meaningful discussions, as well as increased knowledge of basic statistical concepts.

AB  - Phenomenon: The integration of public health (PH) competency training into medical education, and further integration of PH and primary care, has been urged by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. However, PH competencies are numerous, and no consensus exists over which competencies are most important for adoption by current trainees. Our objective was to conduct a group concept mapping exercise with stakeholders identifying the most important and feasible PH skills to incorporate in medical and residency curricula.Approach: We utilized a group concept mapping technique via the Concept System Global Max (http://www.conceptsystems.com), where family medicine educators and PH professionals completed the phrase, “A key Public Health competency for physicians-in-training to learn is …” with 1–10 statements. The statement list was edited for duplication and other issues; stakeholders then sorted the statements and rated them for importance and feasibility of integration. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to create a two-dimensional point map of domains of PH training, allowing visual comparison of groupings of related ideas and relative importance of these ideas.Findings: There were 116 nonduplicative statements (225 total) suggested by 120 participants. Three metacategories of competencies emerged: Clinic, Community & Culture, Health System Understanding, and Population Health Science & Data.Insights: We identified and organized a set of topics that serve as a foundation for the integration of family medicine and PH education. Incorporating these topics into medical education is viewed as important and feasible by family medicine educators and PH professions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of case teaching on how students learn about genetic engineering, in terms of meaningful learning and retention of learning. The study was designed as quasi-experimental research including 63 8th graders (28 boys and 35 girls). To collect data, genetic engineering achievement tests were developed by the researchers and concept maps (CMs) were used. In the study, the experimental group (n = 31) experienced case teaching, while the comparison group (n = 32) experienced ordinary teaching. To analyse the data from achievement test scores, the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Mann–Whitney U test were used. In analysis of the CMs, the number of concepts, number of connecting phrases, number of examples used in the maps and shape of the maps were determined. The analyses showed that the mean achievement scores of the groups significantly differed in favour of the experimental group. Also, retention of the learning in the experimental group was observed. The number of concepts used in CMs did not significantly differ, while the number of connecting phrases in both groups differed significantly in favour of the experimental group. In addition, the students in the experimental group changed their initial hierarchical maps into branched maps, indicating more connection to other concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Helping scientists and engineers challenge received assumptions about how science, engineering, and society relate is a critical cornerstone for macroethics education. Scientific and engineering research are frequently framed as first steps of a value-free linear model that inexorably leads to societal benefit. Social studies of science and assessments of scientific and engineering research speak to the need for a more critical approach to the noble intentions underlying these assumptions. 'Science Outside the Lab' is a program designed to help early-career scientists and engineers understand the complexities of science and engineering policy. Assessment of the program entailed a pre-, post-, and 1 year follow up survey to gauge student perspectives on relationships between science and society, as well as a pre-post concept map exercise to elicit student conceptualizations of science policy. Students leave Science Outside the Lab with greater humility about the role of scientific expertise in science and engineering policy; greater skepticism toward linear notions of scientific advances benefiting society; a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the actors involved in shaping science policy; and a continued appreciation of the contributions of science and engineering to society. The study presents an efficacious program that helps scientists and engineers make inroads into macroethical debates, reframe the ways in which they think about values of science and engineering in society, and more thoughtfully engage with critical mediators of science and society relationships: policy makers and policy processes.

AB  - The authors find justification for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the complex problems that today's students will face as tomorrow's STEM professionals. Teachers with individual subject-area specialties in the STEM content areas have limited experience in integrating STEM. In this study, the authors investigated the conceptual changes of secondary school teachers teaching domain-specific STEM courses after a week-long professional development experience integrating earthquake engineering and domain-specific concepts. They documented and then triangulated outcomes of the experience using participating teachers' concept maps and teacher-generated written materials, respectively. Statistical comparisons of participants' concept maps revealed significant increases in their overall understanding of earthquake engineering and more accurate linkages with and among science domain-specific concepts. Content analyses of teachers' learning products confirmed the concept map analysis and also provided evidence of transfer of workshop learning experiences into teacher-designed curriculum products accurately linking earthquake engineering and domain-specific STEM content knowledge.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students’ concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers’ marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students’ concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students’ understanding with one student’s performance as a showcase. Teachers’ views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students’ conceptual learning.

AB  - A simple "stop think" approach was developed to encourage the self-assessment of learning. A key element was the requirement for students to rate their feeling of difficulty before [FOD(post)] and after [FOD(post)] completing each of three authentic anatomy and physiology concept map exercises. The cohort was divided into low- (group L) and highperforming (group H) groups (based on final subject marks). Both FOD(post) (group L) and FOD(post) (groups L and H) were significantly negatively correlated with score for some maps. A comparison of FOD(post) and FOD(post) showed that students changed their mind about difficulty in 58-70% of the completed maps. Students who changed their estimation were asked to provide explanatory comments, and an increase in difficulty was related to problems with map link generation. For students who found the maps easier, 40% of comments indicated that map generation prompted recall of information from memory. Both difficulty estimations and comments supported the contention that students were self-assessing their interaction with the concept maps. Group H was significantly older than group L, had significantly higher levels of deep strategic and deep motivational learning, and had significantly higher marks in two of three concept map exercises. Notwithstanding these differences, the results from the "stop think" approach were similar between groups, indicating that it may be appropriate for students of varying academic ability. It is suggested that "stop think" may be a useful approach to encourage student self-assessment, an important step in assisting self-regulated learning development. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this study, Turkish prospective elementary science teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration has been analysed within the contexts of ecosystem knowledge, organism knowledge and interconnection knowledge (IK). In the analysis, concept maps developed by 74 prospective teachers were used. The study was carried out with prospective teachers in their final year who were enrolled in the special teaching methods course. The results show that prospective teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, energy flow and matter cycling is quite different from one another’s. In addition, the present study revealed that prospective elementary science teachers showed weak understanding of energy flow and matter, cycling and cellular respiration concepts and IK category but they had strong understanding of photosynthesis concept. Prospective teachers also experience difficulties in understanding connections between macro- and microbiological systems. The study concludes with suggestions for more meaningful biology education.

AB  - Disciplinary boundaries become increasingly unclear when grappling with “wicked problems,” which present a complex set of policy, cultural, technological, and scientific dimensions. “T-shaped” professionals, i.e. individuals with a depth and breadth of expertise, are being called upon to play a critical role in complex problem-solving. This paper unpacks the notion of the “T-shaped expert” and seeks to situate it within the broader academic literature on expertise, integration, and developmental learning. A component of this project includes an exploratory study, which is aimed at evaluating the emergent attributes of T-shaped expertise in two different educational programs completed between January and May in 2015. The two programs build disciplinary knowledge in science, technology engineering, and mathematics fields at the core (vertical dimension), while expanding the students’ awareness and comprehension of other expertise (horizontal dimension). The courses introduced science and engineering students to case study topics focusing around complex human-technological-ecological systems in a nanotechnology and society course; and the governance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a science, technology, and society course. We analyze pre- and post-test data from this pilot project before presenting findings that pertain to student learning, as well as variants in the methodology and reflect on the utility (and limitations) of the selected methodology for evaluating expertise as it evolves over time. The paper closes with a discussion of a theory of acquisition with implications for delineating early attributes and characteristics of T-shaped expertise.ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHERCopyright of Social Epistemology is the property of Routledge and its content may not be copied or emailed to multiple sites or posted to a listserv without the copyright holder's express written permission.

AB  - Teachers make a difference for the outcome of their students in science classrooms. One focus in this context lies on teachers’ professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students’ performance in science. Students’ science performance was conceptualised bysystem thinkingperformance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students’ performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students’ performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers’ PCK and students’ performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students’ performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes.

AB  - This paper describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students’ understandings of particle physics. Fifty-nine year 12 (16- and 17 year-old) students from two London schools participated. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were instructed how to make a concept map and were provided with 24 topic-specific key words. Students’ concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions they represented, enumerating how many students had made each one, and by identifying errors and potential misconceptions, with reference to the specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by a majority of students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although there was evidence that some students were unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Nursing education provides opportunities for students to create positive changes in a clinical setting. Thus, the use of modern teaching approaches such as concept mapping (CM) in nursing can be useful. The aim of this study is to explain nursing students’ perception of applying CM. Methods: This qualitative study reports CM in nursing students. Research areas were nursing colleges affiliated with the Iran and Tehran Universities of Medical Sciences. The participants comprised 25 nursing students who entered the research purposefully. Interviews were conducted face-to-face and semi-structured. All interviews were recorded, transcribed, reviewed, and the results were then extracted. Results: Two categories and four subcategories were identified. The categories included transcendence of meaningful learning and improvement clinical skills. Transcendence of meaningful learning had 2 subcategories: favorable perception and deliberative interpretation. Improvement of clinical skills also had 2 subcategories: reinforcing critical thinking and facilitating patient-centered care. Conclusion: Identifying nursing students’ perception of CM techniques can assist nursing education administrators in providing better education to students both theoretically and practically based on the use of the aforementioned technique.

AB  - Background: People's ability to appraise claims about treatment effects is crucial for informed decision-making. Our objective was to systematically map this area of research in order to (a) provide an overview of interventions targeting key concepts that people need to understand to assess treatment claims and (b) to identify assessment tools used to evaluate people's understanding of these concepts. The findings of this review provide a starting point for decisions about which key concepts to address when developing new interventions, and which assessment tools should be considered. Methods: We conducted a systematic mapping review of interventions and assessment tools addressing key concepts important for people to be able to assess treatment claims. A systematic literature search was done by a reserach librarian in relevant databases. Judgement about inclusion of studies and data collection was done by at least two researchers. We included all quantitative study designs targeting one or more of the key concepts, and targeting patients, healthy members of the public, and health professionals. The studies were divided into four categories: risk communication and decision aids, evidence-based medicine and critical appraisal, understanding of controlled trials, and science education. Findings were summarised descriptively. Results: We included 415 studies, of which the interventions and assessment tools we identified included only a handful of the key concepts. The most common key concepts in interventions were Treatments usually have beneficial and harmful effects, 'Treatment comparisons should be fair, Compare like with like, and Single studies can be misleading. A variety of assessment tools were identified, but only four assessment tools included 10 or more key concepts. Conclusions: There is great potential for developing learning and assessment tools targeting key concepts that people need to understand to assess claims about treatment effects. There is currently no instrument covering assessment of all these key concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background and purpose:Research in formative assessment often pays close attention to the strategies which can be used by teachers. However, less emphasis in the literature seems to have been paid to study the application of formative assessment designs in practice. In this paper, we argue that a formative assessment design that we callEva-Mapping, which is developed on the principles of design-based research, can be a productive starting point for disseminating and further developing formative assessment practices in outdoor science teaching. Sample, design and methods:We conducted an evaluation of the design, based on video-elicited focus group interviews with two groups of experienced science teachers. Both groups consisted of teachers who taught science outside the classroom on a regular basis. These groups watched identical video sequences which were recorded during lessons in which teachers applied the formative assessment design. These sequences focused on formative assessment in pairs, in small groups, or in whole class sessions. Afterwards, the teachers discussed each sequence. These discussions were audio recorded and later transcribed. The transcriptions were analysed using content analysis. Findings:By analysing the interview data, we identified two categories of context-determining factors that influenced the formative assessment design (namely,Resources or Lack of ResourcesandThe Outdoors) and three mechanisms that influenced the assessment process (namely,Teacher Involvement,Structure in Peer AssessmentandKnowledge Sharing). Finally, we identified four perceived outcomes of the formative assessment design:Enthusiasm,Knowledge Application,AcquirementsandInsight into the Learning Processes. Conclusion:We suggest that knowledge within the identified categories can provide useful guidelines for the future development of formative assessment in science teaching that integrates the outdoors. This is because such knowledge forms part of teachers’ perceptions regarding the acceptability and utility of the formative assessment design. In addition, our study contributes to evidence within an underexplored aspect of formal outdoor science education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - People who claim that applying Novakian concept maps in Turkish is problematic base their arguments largely upon the structural differences between the English and Turkish languages. This study aims to introduce the indexing method to eliminate problems encountered in Turkish applications of Novakian maps and to share the preliminary results of its application. For this purpose, 20 pre-service chemistry teachers who had mastered the concept-mapping method after seven weeks of intense education were asked to prepare concept maps on the topic of atoms by using both the Novakian and indexing methods. The maps were qualitatively assessed by experts regarding informational content. The participants were asked to state in writing their opinions about the indexing method. The resulting analysis revealed that the participants were able to express the relation between two concepts more realistically when they used the indexing method, and the resulting maps were much richer in informational content. Almost all participants (95%) stated that the new method was more convenient in terms of reflecting the necessary mental information. The results of the study show the indexing method to be a much more convenient and informative way of preparing concept maps for both teachers and students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Grounded in the context of the significant differences in service user involvement in social work education and research between the UK and Israel, a joint project between Anglia Ruskin University in the UK and Tel-Hai College in Israel was developed. Its aim was to develop a comparative research methodology to evaluate the outcomes of service user involvement in social work education. A main tenet of our research methodology consisted of partnering with a group of older people who used health and social care services as co-researchers from each country. This co-researching methodology together with the evaluation tools worked effectively in the two respective countries. The key findings highlight that while students in both countries valued the involvement of service users in their training, this occurred more so in Israel, where this is a very new development. Students in both countries developed rich concept maps illustrating the complexity of such an involvement. Yet, while the responses of both groups to vignettes describing user involvement scenarios reflected the positive impact of such an involvement, the UK students focused on the negative impact of potential risk more so than the Israeli students.

AB  - This article considers what might be taught to meet a widely held curriculum aim of students being able to understand research in a discipline. Expertise, which may appear as a 'chain of practice', is widely held to be underpinned by networks of understanding. Scientific research expertise is considered from this perspective. Within scientific disciplines, how research is conducted to solve different problems varies with concomitant effects on the validity of the data and the strengths of the claims made. Despite this variation, the overarching concepts of validity and reliability and the underpinning and interrelated network of more specific 'concepts of evidence' are applicable to understanding a wide range of research designs and the uncertainties in the resultant data and claims. These constituent ideas, which inter alia have been validated as relevant to professional and academic expertise, form an integrated knowledge base about evidence which can be visualised on a concept map. The network of ideas underpinning research expertise across scientific disciplines is outlined. Research from explicitly teaching the concepts of evidence is reported, and the implications for teaching and learning in science-based disciplines in HE are considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background:Enhancing students’ metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts. Purpose:The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students’ metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science. Sample:A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study. Design and methods:The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him. In order to enhance the students’ metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, theMetacognitive Support Questionnaire(MSpQ) and the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire (MStQ), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light. Results:The results showed gains in theMSpQbut not in theMStQ. However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test. Conclusion:Although the quantitative data obtained from theMetacognitive Strategies Questionnairedid not show significant gains in the students’ metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students’ metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from theMetacognitive Support Questionnaireshowed that there were significant gains in the students’ perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students’ achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping (CCM) by comparing it with a paper-and-pencil approach. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a physics course. The control group drew concept maps using the paper-and-pencil method and face-to-face discussion, whereas the experimental group employed Google Docs to create concept maps and used Google Chat for discussion. Learning achievements, physics concept representation, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward CCM were examined to identify the differences between the two groups and the effectiveness of Google Docs. The results suggested that the use of Google Docs did not significantly affect physics achievement. However, Google Docs fostered physics concept representation and enhanced attitudes toward science. Moreover, the Google Docs group tended to learn more collaboratively. The students in this group also agreed with the superiority of observation and modification functions provided by the real-time co-editing mechanism and revision history. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Location, as the fundamental concept in geography, is important for all sciences that study objects and behaviours in geo-space. Although other disciplines are capable of formulating definitions of location and geo-space, they nevertheless look up to geography to devise and articulate a comprehensive and practical concept of 'everything geographic'. Essentially quantitative in its concern, geography has yet to quantify the concept of geo-space in order to both fulfil the ancient Greeks' vision of geography and advance it for use in other disciplines. We revisit the epistemological and broader philosophical principles of geo-space and apply these principles to identifying and quantifying the key aspects of geo-space: topos, choros and geos. Rather than following the narrow numerical tradition of quantitative geography and GIS, we adopt broader philosophical perspective of Kant on Quantity (Unity, Multiplicity, Totality) and argue that the 'natural' extension of the classical approach to geo-space necessitates its further philosophical quantification. We show that the ancient Greeks' concept maps into locations ( topos), spatial relations ( choros) and topology ( geos). Extending the concept further necessitates the use of the language of set theory for defining basic concepts. We show that the result is both tractable and quantifiable, connects classical with modern and completes the definition of geo-space on all three levels of Quantity (unity, multiplicity, totality). We demonstrate the tractability of thus defined concept by reinterpreting Tobler's First Law of geography in theoretically sound terms. We show that a refined, modern concept of geo-space is both philosophically fulfilling and practically useful - some properties of geo-space are too important to be ignored or distorted.

AB  - Nurses confront complex problems and decisions that require critical thinking in order to identify patient needs and implement best practices. An active strategy for teaching students the skills to think critically is the concept map. This study explores the development of critical thinking among nursing students in a required pathophysiology and pharmacology course during the first year of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in response to concept mapping as an interventional strategy, using the Health Education Systems, Incorporated critical thinking test. A two-group experimental study with a pretest and posttest design was used. Participants were randomly divided into a control group ( n = 42) taught by traditional didactic lecturing alone, and an intervention group ( n = 41), taught by traditional didactic lecturing with concept mapping. Students in the concept mapping group performed much better on the Health Education Systems, Incorporated than students in the control group. It is recommended that deans, program directors, and nursing faculties evaluate their curricula to integrate concept map teaching strategies in courses in order to develop critical thinking abilities in their students.

AB  - Empirical analysis of secondary biology classrooms revealed that, on average, 68% of teaching time in Germany revolved around processing tasks. Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons pertaining to the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’. Two fundamental characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition, summary, define, classify and high level information processing: interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or concept level content). Additionally,students’ cognitive knowledge structureabout the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’ was measured using student-drawn concept maps (N = 970 students). Finally, linear multilevel models were created withhigh-level cognitive processing tasksandhigher content complexity tasksas class-level predictors andstudents’ prior knowledge,students’ interest in biology, andstudents’ interest in biology activitiesas control covariates. Results showed a positive influence ofhigh-level cognitive processing tasks(β = 0.07;p < .01) onstudents’ cognitive knowledge structure. However, there was no observed effect ofhigher content complexity tasksonstudents’ cognitive knowledge structure. Presented findings encourage the use ofhigh-level cognitive processing tasksin biology instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This two-group quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of the Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material (ONACOM) integrated with inquiry teaching and expository teaching methods. Grade 7 students' posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest-posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students' achievement and improve their attitude. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Ecological models are currently the most used approaches to classify and conceptualise determinants of sedentary behaviour, but these approaches are limited in their ability to capture the complexity of and interplay between determinants. The aim of the project described here was to develop a transdisciplinary dynamic framework, grounded in a system-based approach, for research on determinants of sedentary behaviour across the life span and intervention and policy planning and evaluation. Methods: A comprehensive concept mapping approach was used to develop the Systems Of Sedentary behaviours (SOS) framework, involving four main phases: (1) preparation, (2) generation of statements, (3) structuring (sorting and ranking), and (4) analysis and interpretation. The first two phases were undertaken between December 2013 and February 2015 by the DEDIPAC KH team (DEterminants of DIet and Physical Activity Knowledge Hub). The last two phases were completed during a two-day consensus meeting in June 2015. Results: During the first phase, 550 factors regarding sedentary behaviour were listed across three age groups (i.e., youths, adults and older adults), which were reduced to a final list of 190 life course factors in phase 2 used during the consensus meeting. In total, 69 international delegates, seven invited experts and one concept mapping consultant attended the consensus meeting. The final framework obtained during that meeting consisted of six clusters of determinants: Physical Health and Wellbeing (71 % consensus), Social and Cultural Context (59 % consensus), Built and Natural Environment (65 % consensus), Psychology and Behaviour (80 % consensus), Politics and Economics (78 % consensus), and Institutional and Home Settings (78 % consensus). Conducting studies on Institutional Settings was ranked as the first research priority. The view that this framework captures a system-based map of determinants of sedentary behaviour was expressed by 89 % of the participants. Conclusion: Through an international transdisciplinary consensus process, the SOS framework was developed for the determinants of sedentary behaviour through the life course. Investigating the influence of Institutional and Home Settings was deemed to be the most important area of research to focus on at present and potentially the most modifiable. The SOS framework can be used as an important tool to prioritise future research and to develop policies to reduce sedentary time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Delphi technique is a widely used and accepted method for gathering data from participants within domain of expertise. The objective of this study is to discuss the process of the three rounds Delphi technique in seeking a consensus of concept mapping structure and Multiple Choice Questions (MCQ) in Diabetic Mellitus subject. In the first, round, participants were given a structured questionnaire regarding item of concept mapping structure and MCQ in Diabetic Mellitus subject. The second were added mean and median value of round one. In the third round were add mean and median value of round two were added. Participants were asked to rate the categorised responses from Round 1 on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 being "Very irrelevant" and 5 being "Very relevant". This technique does not require participants to meet face-to-face, thereby making it useful to conduct surveys with qualified people over a wide geographic area. The feedback process allows and encourages the selected Delphi participants to reassess their initial judgements about the information provided in previous iterations. Data is then analysed to check for consistency of experts' responses between rounds. Instrument developed from the Delphi technique research findings is also examined for validation from experts in educational medical health sciences on content and constructs validity. Analysis on the consensus of data from experts was based on median, inter quartile range and quartile deviation on Round 1, 2 and 3 data. Therefore, the Delphi technique is an appropriate method for identifying significant issues related with academic. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students' organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of concept mapping (CM) on the academic performance of medical students' in problem-solving as well as in declarative knowledge questions and their perception regarding CM. Methods: The present analytical and questionnaire-based study was carried out at Bahria University Medical and Dental College (BUMDC), Karachi, Pakistan. In this analytical study, students were assessed with problem-solving questions (A-type MCQs), and declarative knowledge questions (short essay questions), and 50% of the questions were from the topics learned by CM. Students also filled a 10-item, 3-point Likert scale questionnaire about their perception regarding the effectiveness of the CM approach, and two open-ended questions were also asked. Results: There was a significant difference in the marks obtained in those problem-solving questions, which were learned by CM as compared to those topics which were taught by the traditional lectures (p<0.001), while no significant difference was observed in marks in declarative knowledge questions (p=0.704). Analysis of students' perception regarding CM showed that majority of the students perceive that CM is a helpful technique and it is enjoyed by the students. In open-ended questions, the majority of the students commented positively about the effectiveness of CM. Conclusion: Our results indicate that CM improves academic performance in problem solving but not in declarative knowledge questions. Students' perception about the effectiveness of CM was overwhelmingly positive. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non-mediated and drawn from personal experience.

AB  - In this paper the authors describe how the use of multiple methods of qualitative data collection over a two-year period, including interviews, concept maps and journals, and the analysis of data through visual inquiry, categorizing (constant comparison thematic analysis), and connecting (narrative analysis) provided a more comprehensive understanding of the process of evolution in college teachers' perspectives on teaching and learning within a professional development program than would have emerged with only a single method . Concept maps provided an initial visual footprint of teachers' emerging perspectives. Categorization revealed four major patterns across teachers' perspectives. Connecting the data through narrative summaries exposed a contextualized rendition of aspects of individual teachers' perspectives. Each of these three approaches offers a unique lens into qualitative data analysis, and when used together, they clarify important aspects of the phenomenon under investigation.

AB  - For this article, I ask how it might be possible to study the encounter between the practices that involve the concept of the Neuro(n) and educational practices of teaching and learning. The article aims to experiment by thinking “the concept as method.” This entails the doubled and entangled movement of tracing-and-mapping the concept of—in this case—the Neuro(n). I suggest that the contemporary obsession with the Neuro(n) in the field of education emerges from the desire to know more about the learning subject, knowledge, and the problem of how something new comes into the world.

AB  - The green chemistry course taught at Westminster College (PA) incorporates nontraditional teaching techniques and texts to educate future chemists about the importance of using green chemistry principles. The course is designed to introduce green chemistry concepts and demonstrate their inherent necessity by discussing historical missteps by the chemical industry, and future design possibilities. Students learn to apply green chemistry principles through case studies and journal article activities, while connecting all of these resources and experiences with concept maps. The final course project requires students to create their own green chemistry educational materials. This nontraditional approach to teaching chemistry provides an opportunity for students to learn in dynamic ways and to be creative in their contributions to green chemistry. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study examined the reflection interview as a tool for assessing and facilitating the use of ‘systems language’ amongst 11th grade students who have recently completed their first year of high school biology. Eighty-three students composed two concept maps in the 10th grade—one at the beginning of the school year and one at its end. The first part of the interview is dedicated to guiding the students through comparing their two concept maps and by means of both explicit and non-explicit teaching. Our study showed that the explicit guidance in comparing the two concept maps was more effective than the non-explicit, eliciting a variety of different, more specific,typesof interactions and patterns (e.g. ‘hierarchy’, ‘dynamism’, ‘homeostasis’) in the students’ descriptions of the human body system. The reflection interview as a knowledge integration activity was found to be an effective tool for assessing the subjects’ conceptual models of ‘system complexity’, and for identifying those aspects of a system that are most commonly misunderstood.

AB  - Minimal research has been accumulated in the field of social studies education for Novakian concept mapping, yet there are many benefits from adding this learning tool to a teacher's instructional toolbox. The article defines Novakian concept mapping and invites readers to adopt digital Novakian concept mapping into the social studies classroom as a means to build content knowledge, to understand what students are thinking about content, and to provide opportunities for students to make relevant and important connections within the body of knowledge defined as social studies. A concept map is like an Instagram of a student's thinking about a particular topic. Steps for teachers to teach students how to introduce and create a Novakian concept map are included in the manuscript along with sample focus questions and maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Students attending object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) courses typically encounter difficulties transitioning from requirements analysis to logical design and then to physical design. Concept maps have been widely used in studies of user learning. The study reported here, based on the relationship of concept maps to learning theory and semantic memory, suggests that integrating OOAD instruction with concept maps might help learners understand these transitions more clearly. An empirical experiment, involving two treatments based on concept maps and conventional instruction, was conducted to examine the relevance of concept map-based instruction for an effective understanding of phase transitions. The results indicate that compared with conventional instruction, concept map-based instruction is more efficient in improving learner understanding because of greater learner engagement and because of concept maps' properties when they are used as an information medium. This study can aid instructors in realizing the difficulties in learning phase transitions and motivate researchers to develop more effective learning instructions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (n = 19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (n = 23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential.

AB  - Aim and objectives To examine how nurses collect and use cues from respiratory assessment to inform their decisions as they wean patients from ventilatory support. Background Prompt and accurate identification of the patient's ability to sustain reduction of ventilatory support has the potential to increase the likelihood of successful weaning. Nurses' information processing during the weaning from mechanical ventilation has not been well-described. Design A descriptive ethnographic study exploring critical care nurses' decision-making processes when weaning mechanically ventilated patients from ventilatory support in the real setting. Methods Novice and expert Scottish and Greek nurses from two tertiary intensive care units were observed in real practice of weaning mechanical ventilation and were invited to participate in reflective interviews near the end of their shift. Data were analysed thematically using concept maps based on information processing theory. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Results Scottish and Greek critical care nurses acquired patient-centred objective physiological and subjective information from respiratory assessment and previous knowledge of the patient, which they clustered around seven concepts descriptive of the patient's ability to wean. Less experienced nurses required more encounters of cues to attain the concepts with certainty. Subjective criteria were intuitively derived from previous knowledge of patients' responses to changes of ventilatory support. All nurses used focusing decision-making strategies to select and group cues in order to categorise information with certainty and reduce the mental strain of the decision task. Conclusions Nurses used patient-centred information to make a judgment about the patients' ability to wean. Decision-making strategies that involve categorisation of patient-centred information can be taught in bespoke educational programmes for mechanical ventilation and weaning. Relevance to clinical practice Advanced clinical reasoning skills and accurate detection of cues in respiratory assessment by critical care nurses will ensure optimum patient management in weaning mechanical ventilation.

AB  - In this paper, we will be carrying out an in-depth analysis of a series of investigations involving concept maps used in eye tracking methodology. First, the background to this kind of research is analyzed: on the one hand we will focus on generic scientific literature about those concept maps with theoretical foundations in the psychology of learning, and second the literature of eye tracking in teaching and learning will be reviewed. Finally, we will center our attention on the way in which the literature for these two areas overlaps. A total of 15 published works on concept maps using eye tracking were located and subsequently the quality of these papers, their visibility, topics, and results were analyzed. The findings show there are very few published works on this subject, all originated from dispersed sources which proved difficult to locate, despite the fact that eye tracking methodology lends itself perfectly to the study of concept maps. We predict that in coming years there will be many more publications in this field. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - En este artículo se presentan los resultados de una revisión bibliográfica sobre las investigaciones publicadas hasta la fecha sobre mapas conceptuales aplicando la metodología del seguimiento de la mirada. Se estudian los antecedentes de este tipo de trabajos: por un lado la producción científica genérica sobre mapas conceptuales con bases teóricas en la psicología del aprendizaje y por otro lado la metodología del seguimiento de la mirada aplicada a la investigación sobre la enseñanza y el aprendizaje. Finalmente se concreta en la intersección de ambos tipos de trabajos y se reseñan 15 publicaciones sobre mapas conceptuales usando el seguimiento de la mirada. Se analiza la calidad de estos trabajos, su visibilidad, los temas tratados y los resultados obtenidos. Los conclusiones son que hay pocas publicaciones, dispersas y con poca visibilidad y que el seguimiento de la mirada se aplica de forma poco eficiente. A pesar de estas conclusiones, se constata que la metodología del seguimiento de la mirada se adecua muy bien al estudio de los mapas conceptuales y se pronostica que en los próximos años habrán muchos más trabajos en este campo.

AB  - This article examines the efficacy of using concept mapping to identify the key dimensions that influence the use of research-based information by school practitioners, including teachers, educational counsellors, and school administrators. This mapping exercise was the first step in developing a competency framework for translation of research-based knowledge in education. Its aim was to provoke collective reflection of key stakeholders in the education sector who are already playing a role in knowledge transfer in their settings, tofind out what should be done to make the scientific knowledge more useful to professional practices in schools. Altogether, the exercise identified eight domains that, according to respondents, influence the use of research in schools. These results were subsequently validated by three subgroups of participants and compared against the scientific literature on the topic to lay the foundation for identifying competencies that should be included in the framework. The map produced in the exercise described in this article presents a first picture of how things should be, in education, in order for teachers, educational counsellors, and school administrators to be informed by research-based information. The concept mapping methodology used in this study combined qualitative and quantitative approaches and was based on the active participation of key stakeholders. In the context of a project to develop a competency framework tofoster knowledge translation, we consider this method to be appropriate and compares favourably with other group techniques.

AB  - Concept mapping and retrieval practice are both educational methods that have separately been reported to provide significant benefits for learning in diverse settings. Concept mapping involves diagramming a hierarchical representation of relationships between distinct pieces of information, whereas retrieval practice involves retrieving information that was previously coded into memory. The relative benefits of these two methods have never been tested against each other in a classroom setting. Our study was designed to investigate whether or not concept mapping or retrieval practice produced a significant learning benefit in an undergraduate physiology course as measured by exam performance and, if so, was the benefit of one method significantly greater than the other. We found that there was a trend toward increased exam scores for the retrieval practice group compared with both the control group and concept mapping group, and that trend achieved statistical significance for one of the four module exams in the course. We also found that women performed statistically better than men on the module exam that contained a substantial amount of material relating to female reproductive physiology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers' classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimentala), the contemporary condition (Experimentalb), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students' discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimentala and Experimentalb conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students' scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers’ misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention. Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky’s theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness. Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers’ understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention. Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers’ did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers’ prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors.

AB  - The use of a companion app to augment viewing of information-rich television programmes is investigated. The app displays a synchronised graphical abstraction of a programme's content in the form of a concept map. Two experiments were conducted involving participants watching an astronomy documentary with the app. The first compared watching the programme with and without the app, and the second compared non-interactive and interactive versions of the app. Understanding of the programme, cross-device gaze behaviour, and user experience of the app were assessed. Our results show that the companion app improved participants' understanding and recall of the programme. Participants were found to manage their visual attention systematically when using the companion app, and correlations were found in the way they shifted their gaze from TV screen to tablet and back in response to changes in the programme content. Increasing interaction with the app disrupted understanding of the television programme and visual attention. Participants were positive about the value of companion apps for understanding and recall of programmes, but distraction and 'knowing where to look' were significant concerns. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - If a person has ‘a problem’ to solve and knows the solution and just has to apply it (retrieve it from memory and re-act), it is not a problem—it is a task; if a person does not know the solution and has to create it—this is a problem. Using this language, there are only two situations: (a) one has to perform a task; or (b) one has to solve a problem by creating a new (for the person) procedure, i.e. one has to create a brand new (for the one) solution; of course, one must utilize some of the knowledge previously stored in the memory (we could call this action ‘creative utilization of previous knowledge’).If a student learned how to perform a task, he or she can repeat it in the future as many times as this student has to repeat the same task. The key word is ‘the same’. Our brain is a powerful pattern recognition machine. As soon as it recognizes the task, it retrieves from memory the sequence of the actions, which has to be performed to succeed. If a brain does not recognize the task, we have two options: (a) the task is the same but due to some features it is camouflaged as a different one; (b) the task is different from the ones in the past and is really new for the brain, and the brain does not have the solution (at least in full) in its storage. Of course, we assume that a particular brain is capable of storing and retrieving the information and governing the actions required for fulfilling the task (otherwise we have to discuss a case of learning disabilities).Based on this approach, every teacher has to teach students to two different practices: (a) how to perform specific tasks (the set of those tasks should be specified by a curriculum); (b) how to create a solution to a problem which has not been solved in the past (by that person); the latter practice, in turn, requires a practice in making a conclusion regarding the familiarity of the given assignment—is it the same as one from the past (is it a task?) or different (is it a problem?)? Development of such a skill also requires specific practice.Teaching how to find a solution means (in part) teaching how to recognize the old task in the new one and to apply the appropriate method (which worked in the past).Teaching how to create/invent a solution which has not been presented/trained before (at least in full) means teaching thinking creatively (a.c.a. critically). Although due to the definition of ‘creativity’the act of creating something new should be seen as the result of an insight, a teacher can help a student to get to that insight as close as possible using specific teaching tools (learning aids).Many teaching instruments of the kind have been discussed and offered by various research. For example, E F Redish (2004) offers a general framework for Physics Education Research based on modeling student thinking. ‘Teaching Introductory Physics’ by Arnold B Arons (1997) is an invaluable source of many teaching tools and techniques. Many specific teaching strategies, including examples of mapping and guided thinking one will find in the works of K Heller and P Heller (1995). A Elby (2001) provides a broad summary on helping students learn how to learn (including asking prompting questions). D Rosengrant et al (2009) offer a study of the use of diagrams, including free-body diagrams, as a helping tool for solving problems in mechanics. D Van Domelen provides a review of the use of strategy maps and thinking algorithms. An excellent recourse letter is provided by L C McDermont and E F Redish (1999). The use of concept maps in education has been discussed in details by J D Novak (1984).In these works a reader will find a description of several tools which the author finds also helpful for students learning how to solve physics problems. These tools help students to get a better understanding of how a mind of an expert problem solver works when solving a problem. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recent school science curriculum developments in many countries emphasise that scientists derive evidence for their claims through different approaches; that such practices are bound up with disciplinary knowledge; and that the quality of data should be appreciated. This position paper presents an understanding of the validity of data as a set of conceptual relationships, illustrating the application of the network of ideas and their inter-relationships necessary for the ‘thinking behind the doing’ with examples from practice. We explore ways in which this understanding of data is inherently related to underpinning disciplinary ideas. We suggest how the recognition of a conceptual basis for understanding the quality of data represents an ontological shift with respect to widespread characterisations of scientific practices which addresses some long-standing issues in science education research, policy, curricula and practice.

AB  - Background: Literature contends that a teacher’s knowledge of concept map-based tasks influence how their students perceive the task and execute the creation of acceptable concept maps. Teachers who are skilled concept mappers are able to (1) understand and apply the operational terms to construct a hierarchical/non-hierarchical concept map; (2) identify the legitimacy of the constructed concept map by verifying its graphical structure and its educational utility; and (3) determine the inherent ‘good’ and ‘poor’ qualities of the resulting graphical structure to reiterate the ‘good’ qualities and to coach and provide feedback to alleviate ‘poor’ qualities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of prospective teachers’ knowledge underpinning the technique used to construct concept maps and thus, explicate their facility to construct concept maps. Sample, Design and Methods: Data consisted of 200 concept maps constructed by prospective teachers in an elementary science methods course. Results: Analysis revealed that the prospective teachers had predominantly constructed either hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical concept maps. It is likely that their maps reflect the teaching that they themselves would have experienced in their science classrooms during their own education. Additionally, most of these concepts maps only contained the root concept and subordinate concepts and lacked directional linking lines, linking phrases, labelled lines and propositions. Conclusions: We argue that teacher educators need to assess their prospective teachers’ understanding of concept mapping in relation to the legitimacy (the nature and quality) of the end-products (graphical structures) of such practices. Prospective teachers also need to understand the educational utility of concept mapping in terms of how these end-products impact and/or effectuate learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT In secondary science education, the learning and teaching of coherent conceptual understanding are often problematic. Context-based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context-embedded learning-teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context-based lesson sequence about protein-rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th-grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context-embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The development of seismic microzonation maps is now a prerequisite for performing advanced seismic hazards and seismic risk assessments in urban areas. Current microzonation procedures are based on classifying site response in soil categories based on $$\hbox {V}_\mathrm{S30}$$ . In many practical cases, information on shear wave velocity is sparse and analysts must resort to other sources of information to develop zonation maps over large regions. For Montreal, Canada, a geostatistical approach combining a large dataset of boreholes, $$\hbox {f}_{0}$$ data from the H/V method, and a limited number of shear wave velocity measurements is proposed. Predictive equations are developed with the different types of information and partly used to create three different $$\hbox {V}_\mathrm{s30}$$ models: A first model based on the total thickness of soft soil deposits (One Layer Model), a second model based on stratigraphy obtained from borehole data (Four Layers Model) and a third model (Composite Model) that combines data from the previous two models with data from seismic surveys. Variability and uncertainty associated with the choice of the models are described and estimated using a second moment analysis. The composite model which combines borehole, $$\hbox {f}_{0}$$ and Vs data is shown to be the most accurate compared to models derived only from borehole and Vs data (an average reduction of 40 % of the squared error) and shows good agreement with the geological map for clay and sand locations with soils classes C and D (54 % agreement on average). This approach opens new perspectives for $$\hbox {V}_\mathrm{s30}$$ microzonation in urban areas when budgets for Vs surveys are limited. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objective. To test the hypothesis that small group concept mapping of 4 core neonatal topics as part of a fourth-year allopathic medical student elective would improve critical thinking (CT) as measured by the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST). To describe any correlations between scores on the CCTST and the step 1 and step 2 Clinical Knowledge parts of the United States Medical Licensing Exam. Methods. Twenty-seven students participated in this pilot study during a 1-month elective. A pretest CCTST, California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI), and multiple choice knowledge test (MCKT) were completed immediately before the elective began. Four weekly group sessions were held with assigned reading on each of the 4 neonatal topics. Concept mapping was performed in small groups of 4 to 6 students with a group concept map collected at the end of the exercise. A posttest CCTST and MCKT was completed after the 4 group sessions. Results. Pre-CCTST overall score was 83.9 ± 6, and post-CCTST overall score was 85.6 ± 6.9 (P = .57). Pearson correlation of USMLE step 1 and pre-CCTST showed r(25) = .276, P = .164. Pearson correlation of USMLE step 2 CK and pre-CCTST revealed r(25) = .214, P = .482. The precourse MCKT average was 35%, and the postcourse average 50% (P ≤ .001). Conclusions. A recent meta-analysis confirms this is the first report of a comparison between the increasingly common CCTST and the USMLE. We confirmed that concept mapping is a valid mechanism to teach content knowledge. Although the difference in the CCTST scores was not significant, this study could serve as an important start toward development of a curriculum devoted to teaching content and improving CT. The small number of students may have prevented us from defining a significant impact. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Patients with psychiatric disorders receive nursing care in psychiatric units, medical units and long-term care facilities. Like other patients, their well-being is reliant upon knowledgeable caregivers. The pharmacological interventions that patients are dependent on can have catastrophic effects; of particular concern is Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS). This article affords a succinct review of the literature related to NMS and provides suggestions for psychiatric nurse educators to facilitate early recognition, thereby reducing mortality and morbidity. Emphasis is placed on educational tools to help reduce under-detection. A case study illustrates how under-detection can lead to a near fatal outcome. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In the context of model-driven development of database applications with UML, the (usually relational) database schema is obtained automatically from the application's structural (class) UML model. Changes in requirements often lead to modifications of the application's structural model. Such changes, in turn, have to be propagated to the underlying database schema. Very often, especially when the system is in production with a large volume of users' live data, the data is considered to be valuable enough to be preserved through these changes. This paper describes an approach to cope with the problem of model evolution with the ultimate requirement to preserve the data stored in the database. The algorithm interactively determines differences between structural UML models before and after the changes and resolves those differences into transformations in the relational database domain.

AB  - The purpose of the research was to establish the impact of the application of a concept map in chemistry lessons on the effective solving of tasks with organic reactions content. In the first phase of the research, a concept map was produced representing the reactions of hydrocarbons, organic halogenated compounds and organic oxygen compounds, and in the second phase the produced concept map was introduced in lessons. Its impact was tested on a sample consisting of 186 students (average age of 17.8 years), who were divided into a control group (88 students) and an experimental group (98 students). Prior to the experiment, the two groups were equalized in terms of their level of development of formal logical thinking and their average grade in chemistry. A knowledge test, consisting of five problem tasks comprising multiple parts, was used as a quantitative instrument for measuring the impact of the applied concept map. The content of the knowledge test was selected on the basis of the chemistry lesson plan (reactions of organic oxygen compounds) for general upper secondary schools (in Slovenian: gimnazija). An analysis of the task solving showed statistically significant differences in the responses of the experimental group members and the control group members (experimental group M = 15.9; SD = 6.33; control group M = 13.6; SD = 7.93; p = 0.03). The produced concept map contributed to the more effective interrelation of concepts and, consequently, to more effective problem task solving. (English) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]
AB  - Namen raziskave je bil ugotoviti vpliv vključevanja pojmovne mape v pouk in s tem na reševanje nalog s področja organskih kemijskih reakcij. V prvi stopnji raziskave je bila izdelana pojmovna mapa za reakcije ogljikovodikov, organskih halogeniranih in kisikovih spojin. V drugi stopnji je bila izdelana pojmovna mapa uporabljena pri pouku. Njen vpliv na razumevanje organskih kemijskih reakcij je bil preizkušen na vzorcu 186 dijakov (povprečna starost 17,8 let). Dijaki so bili razdeljeni v kontrolno (88 dijakov) in eksperimentalno skupino (98 dijakov). Dijaki obeh skupin so bili izenačeni v stopnji formalno logičnega mišljenja in srednje ocene iz kemije. Kot kvantitativen inštrument za merjenje vpliva uporabe pojmovne mape je bil uporabljen preizkus znanja, sestavljen iz štirih problemov, ki so vključevali več podproblemov. Vsebina preizkusa znanja je pokrivala organske kisikove spojine glede na gimnazijski učni načrt. Analiza rezultatov reševanja preizkusa znanja kaže med kontrolno in eksperimentalno skupino statistično pomembno razliko (kontrolna skupina M = 13,6; SD = 7,93, eksperimentalna skupina M = 15,9; SD = 6,33; p = 0,03). Izdelana pojmovna mapa je vplivala na učinkovitejše povezovanje pojmov, kar je vplivalo na uspešnejše reševanje problemov. (Slovenian) [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The previously published Anchoring Concepts Content Map (ACCM) from the ACS Examinations Institute is updated. Through the development process of the ACCM for other subdisciplines, changes have been made at the top two levels, and these changes need to be reflected in the previously published maps. In addition, a large-scale project to align test items from ACS Exams over the past 20 years revealed specific omissions in the initially published General Chemistry ACCM. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Biomechanics education is a vital component of kinesiology, sports medicine, and physical education, as well as for many biomedical engineering and bioengineering undergraduate programmes. Little research exists regarding effective teaching strategies for biomechanics. However, prior work suggests that student learning in undergraduate physics courses has been aided by using the Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT). As physics understanding plays a role in biomechanics understanding, the purpose of study was to evaluate the use of a JiTT framework in an undergraduate biomechanics course. This two-year action-based research study evaluated three JiTT frameworks: (1) no JiTT; (2) mathematics-based JiTT; and (3) concept-based JiTT. A pre- and post-course assessment of student learning used the biomechanics concept inventory and a biomechanics concept map. A general linear model assessed differences between the course assessments by JiTT framework in order to evaluate learning and teaching effectiveness. The results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in a concept-based JiTT course, relative to a mathematics-based JiTT or no JiTT course structure. These results suggest that a course structure involving concept-based questions using a JiTT strategy may be an effective method for engaging undergraduate students and promoting learning in biomechanics courses.

AB  - In this paper we describe a tool that can be effectively used to evaluate student learning outcomes using concept maps and Markov chain analysis. The main purpose of this tool is to advance the use of artificial intelligence techniques by using concept maps and Markov chains in evaluating a student’s understanding of a particular topic of study using concept maps. The method used in the tool makes use of XML parsing to perform the required evaluation. For the purpose of experimenting this tool we have taken into consideration concept maps developed by students enrolled in two different courses in Computer Science. The result of this experimentation is also discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Traditional methods of instruction can fail to produce enduring ways of learning, especially in rapidly changing disciplines in the life sciences. Educators and funding agencies are thus calling for new, integrated teaching approaches to address the life sciences. Hierarchical frameworks are being proposed as ways to tackle curricula with large numbers of concepts. Comparing lecture-based and interactive formats by measuring performance with pre- and post-tests indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in the more interactive course. Other work has examined how the history of biology can be used to infuse relevance into the biology curriculum. In this paper, I describe a project at Stanford to create, implement, and evaluate an integrated curriculum in undergraduate stem cell education comprised of scientific, laboratory, and ELSI topics.

AB  - This study explored the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and its development of four experienced biology teachers in the context of teaching school genetics. PCK was defined in terms of teacher content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of students’ preconceptions and learning difficulties. Data sources of teacher knowledge base included teacher-constructed concept maps, pre- and post-lesson teacher interviews, video-recorded genetics lessons, post-lesson teacher questionnaire and document analysis of teacher's reflective journals and students’ work samples. The results showed that the teachers’ individual PCK profiles consisted predominantly of declarative and procedural content knowledge in teaching basic genetics concepts. Conditional knowledge, which is a type of meta-knowledge for blending together declarative and procedural knowledge, was also demonstrated by some teachers. Furthermore, the teachers used topic-specific instructional strategies such as context-based teaching, illustrations, peer teaching, and analogies in diverse forms but failed to use physical models and individual or group student experimental activities to assist students’ internalization of the concepts. The finding that all four teachers lacked knowledge of students’ genetics-related preconceptions was equally significant. Formal university education, school context, journal reflection and professional development programmes were considered as contributing to the teachers’ continuing PCK development. Implications of the findings for biology teacher education are briefly discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students’ concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors’ approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students’ conceptions.

AB  - Youths’ views on how community and social influences impact dating violence are virtually absent in research literature, in part because it is difficult to capture. When researchers ask youth what causes dating violence, responses focus on dating violence “triggers.” The few multi-level influences identified revolve around restraining orders and punishing abusers. In this article, we review formats that have been used for youth focus groups, especially in research on teen dating violence. We note that conventional focus groups and concept mapping processes rely on facilitator prompts to elicit discussion based on cause and effect that are assumed to be in line with the researcher’s social science understanding of causality. We then propose a new focus group format that begins with conventional focus group prompts followed by integration of participant concepts with concepts added by the researcher. The new format reverses the typical coding process in which the researcher gleans knowledge from focus group participants post-interview through the lens of the scientific knowledge base. We present pilot results based on three focus groups with 37 youth and 10 adults. We report the effect of the new format on participation, engagement, complexity of discussion, critical thinking about social structure, and participant empowerment. We discuss specific areas in which the focus group formats differed and suggest important implications for focus group methods and practice with groups, especially youth groups.

AB  - Medical school education has traditionally been driven by single discipline teaching and assessment. Newer medical school curricula often implement an organ-based approach that fosters integration of basic science and clinical disciplines. Concept maps are widely used in education. Through diagrammatic depiction of a variety of concepts and their specific connections with other ideas, concept maps provide a unique perspective into learning and performance that can complement other assessment methods commonly used in medical schools. In this innovation, we describe using concepts maps as a vehicle for a modified a classic Team-Based Learning (TBL) exercise. Modifications to traditional TBL in our innovation included replacing an individual assessment using multiple-choice questions with concept maps as well as combining the group assessment and application exercise whereby teams created concept maps. These modifications were made to further assess understanding of content across the Fundamentals module (the introductory module of the preclerkship curriculum). While preliminary, student performance and feedback from faculty and students support the use of concept maps in TBL. Our findings suggest concept maps can provide a unique means of determining assessment of learning and generating feedback to students. Concept maps can also demonstrate knowledge acquisition, organization of prior and new knowledge, and synthesis of that knowledge across disciplines in a unique way providing an additional means of assessment in addition to traditional multiple-choice questions.

AB  - Reflection has recently been emphasized as a constructive pedagogical activity. However, little attention has been given to the quality of reflections that students write. In this study, we explored the reflections that students make about their knowledge organization as part of a formative learning activity. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge structures of Grade 11 physics students and their instructors using pathfinder networks (PFnets). Each student's knowledge structure was compared with the instructors' averaged knowledge structure in order to identify student misconceptions. As an intervention, students were asked to write reflections on the discrepancies between their knowledge structure and their instructors' averaged knowledge structure. The students' reflections were divided into the following three categories depending on the type of knowledge constructed in those reflections: (1) conceptual, (2) procedural, or (3) declarative. Evidence was provided by the study that reflection was an effective means of improving students' knowledge structure. However, conceptual reflections were the most effective, followed by procedural and declarative reflection. Implications for formative classroom assessment are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aims and objectives To identify factors affecting the delivery of health promotion interventions to prevent early childhood human influenza at the household level. Background Yearly, influenza epidemics seriously affect all age groups, particularly those with weakened immune systems, including children. Influenza is transmitted easily from person to person through droplet and direct contact. Maintaining personal hygiene, avoiding close contact with the infected person and proper hand washing are recommended as the most effective means of preventing the transmission of influenza. However, it is not clear what programme-related mechanisms and contexts are crucial to the successful delivery of interventions in the home. This study systematically reviewed published research studies to identify factors influencing the effective delivery of health promotion programmes targeting influenza in a household. Design Realist review. Methods A realist review methodology was selected to examine what interventions are effective in preventing and managing influenza at the household level and in what circumstances. A structured search of the peer-reviewed primary research literature was undertaken using a defined search protocol. Results Eight studies were retrieved for the analysis. Mechanisms impacting on intervention delivery were identified, including timing of implementation, programme reach, organisational and healthcare worker involvement, mode and place of delivery, contact with infected person, health practice compliance and sustainability at home. Conclusion These findings suggest contextual factors that could be identified through ecological approaches to health promotion that are crucial for policymakers to consider when designing interventions. Relevance to clinical practice The active involvement of community nurses through an integrated household visiting programme may help to better deliver family-based health promotion interventions to prevent illnesses such as influenza in children.

AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose-insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary ( n = 15), concept map ( n = 16), model ( n = 23), and outlined model ( n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students' learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats.

AB  - This review provides a summary of distinct Hamiltonians used to describe magnetic and spectroscopic properties of paramagnetic and magnetic coordination compounds. Based on the origins and the underlying physical principles, clear recommendations are formulated on when these Hamiltonians are appropriate and how they relate to each other. The interface, denoted CF (LF) ↔ SH (ZFS), encompasses the physical Hamiltonians, which include the crystal field (CF) [or equivalently ligand field (LF)] Hamiltonians, and the effective spin Hamiltonians (SH), which include the zero-field splitting (ZFS) Hamiltonians, as well as, to a certain extent, also the notion of magnetic anisotropy (MA). Survey of recent literature has revealed that the intricate web of interrelated notions has become dangerously entangled over the years. A given crucial notion is often referred to by one of the three names that are not synonymous: CF (LF), SH (ZFS), or MA, each having a well-defined and established meaning in optical spectroscopy, electron magnetic resonance (EMR), and magnetism, respectively. The terminological confusions occurring in literature call for in-depth clarifications, which are provided in this review. For this purpose, crucial notions are systematically defined and their logical interrelationships illustrated by concept maps. The operator types used to express the CF (LF) and SH (ZFS) Hamiltonians, i.e. the Stevens and Wybourne ones, are classified and their distinct properties discussed. Several key aspects are considered in the nutshell: basic forms of Hamiltonians and definitions of the associated parameters, distinct properties of the Stevens and Wybourne CF (LF) parameters and implications for conversion relations, distinctions and interrelationships between the CF (LF) and SH (ZFS) Hamiltonians or parameters, conversion relations between the Stevens ZFS parameters and conventional ones. The general focus is on the fundamental aspects underlying physics and chemistry of single transition (4f N and 3d N ) ions in coordination compounds as well as the novel single-ion and polynuclear magnetic systems. This includes the single-ion magnets and the exchange coupled systems (ECS) based on transition ions, especially the single molecule magnets (SMM) or molecular nanomagnets (MNM). The general aim is to provide deeper understanding of the major intricacies involved in the CF (LF) ↔ SH (ZFS) interface. The level of presentation is geared toward experimentalists with background in chemistry or physics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Context-based education, in which students deal with biological concepts in a meaningful way, is showing promise in promoting the development of students’ conceptual coherence. However, literature gives little guidance about how this kind of education should be designed. Therefore, our study aims at designing and evaluating the practicability of a context-based biology lesson sequence. Four design principles for conceptual coherence were defined: build upon familiar concepts; focus on core concepts; stimulate establishing connections between concepts; and reflect on these connections. These design principles have been elaborated into a lesson sequence about concepts related to cellular metabolism and the relevant connections between the concepts have been visualised in a reference concept map. The activities of teacher and students that were expected to contribute in establishing these connections were described in a research scenario. The lesson sequence was conducted in a 10th-grade class of 21 students, aged 15–16, in senior general secondary education. Data were collected from video-recordings in the classroom. The observed activities of the teacher and students were compared with the intended activities. The findings show that a research scenario is a powerful tool to systematically evaluate the design and to provide information for improving it. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The Aquarius satellite mission and Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS) are providing the scientific community with new insights into the role seawater salinity plays in the Earth system. Aquarius and SPURS scientists and engineers, working with the University of Maine-based Salinity Public Engagement and Communications team, developed webinars that focused on how these programs' findings increase knowledge about topics such as the water cycle, ocean circulation, and climate. Direct involvement of research scientists and engineers was key to the success of these efforts. These experts learned how to use interactive concept maps to "deconstruct" scientific content into simpler graphical formats for their presentations. A benefit to webinar participants, presenters, and facilitators was that they honed their critical thinking skills. In addition, the webinars allow people traditionally not represented in science, technology, engineering and math to gain better access to high-quality NASA materials. Post-event audience evaluation data provide valuable feedback on the impacts of sharing the results of ocean salinity research beyond the scientific community. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps have been extensively used in education, especially in science teaching. There is strong evidence that their use is associated with increased knowledge transfer and retention across several instructional conditions, settings and methodological features. However, constructing a concept map is complex and difficult for students, especially newbies. Consequently, there is a necessity to provide feedback to the learners during the authoring of their concept maps. There are several concept-mapping tools that provide feedback but none of them provide immediate or just-in-time (JIT) feedback. This kind of feedback is important for two reasons: First, low achieving or low mastery students benefit greatly from this type of feedback. Second, when students start out badly, with incorrect propositions, they tend to continue with further incorrect propositions until the map is grossly incorrect and JIT feedback could prevent this situation. This paper presents a practical application of Ohlsson’s theory of learning from performance errors to provide JIT feedback during the construction of concept maps. It is shown that by creating an Entity-Relationship (E-R) schema that incorporates additional elements into the standard schema for concept maps, the schema can be implemented with Datalog, benefiting from the use of its deductive features to provide immediate feedback to the learner. Finally, some field related examples are provided. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps have been used to help students with learning disabilities (LD) improve literacy skills and content learning, predominantly in secondary school. However, despite increased access to classroom technology, no previous studies have examined the efficacy of computer-based concept maps to improve learning from informational text for students with LD in elementary school. In this study, we used a concurrent delayed multiple probe design to evaluate the interactive use of computer-based concept maps on content acquisition with science and social studies texts for Hispanic students with LD in Grades 4 and 5. Findings from this study suggest that students improved content knowledge during intervention relative to a traditional instruction baseline condition. Learning outcomes and social validity information are considered to inform recommendations for future research and the feasibility of classroom implementation. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Purpose: In this investigation, the construct of perceptual similarity was explored in the dysarthrias. Specifically, we employed an auditory free-classification task to determine whether listeners could cluster speakers by perceptual similarity, whether the clusters mapped to acoustic metrics, and whether the clusters were constrained by dysarthria subtype diagnosis. Method: Twenty-three listeners blinded to speakers’ medical and dysarthria subtype diagnoses participated. The task was to group together (drag and drop) the icons corresponding to 33 speakers with dysarthria on the basis of how similar they sounded. Cluster analysis and multidimensional scaling (MDS) modeled the perceptual dimensions underlying similarity. Acoustic metrics and perceptual judgments were used in correlation analyses to facilitate interpretation of the derived dimensions. Results: Six clusters of similar-sounding speakers and 3 perceptual dimensions underlying similarity were revealed. The clusters of similar-sounding speakers were not constrained by dysarthria subtype diagnosis. The 3 perceptual dimensions revealed by MDS were correlated with metrics for articulation rate, intelligibility, and vocal quality, respectively. Conclusions: This study shows (a) feasibility of a free-classification approach for studying perceptual similarity in dysarthria, (b) correspondence between acoustic and perceptual metrics to clusters of similar-sounding speakers, and (c) similarity judgments transcended dysarthria subtype diagnosis.

AB  - In this study, we developed teaching materials and lesson plans to expand students' understanding of fundamental engineering principles through experimentation with and manufacturing of real products. The products used for this study were a model car and a walking model. With the development of these products as a specific objective and not using special equipment, we aimed to enable students to learn and utilize one of fundamental discipline in engineering, mechanics. The products were introduced in a lecture format class and the effectiveness of the lesson plan was evaluated. Results of the evaluations administered at the beginning and the end of the class showed that the students obtained a greater understanding of mechanics by engaging in the design and production of the two products. Concept maps created by the students showed that through the lesson, they improved their ability to apply scientific knowledge to experimental investigation and manufacturing processes. Moreover, results of a survey questionnaire suggested an improvement in students' aptitude for and confidence in applying scientific knowledge to real problems, including experiments and product manufacturing.

AB  - This article presents the results of the evaluation of SCIViS – a visualization-based scientific information retrieval (IR) system. SCIViS is based on the logic of concept maps and enables the visualization of relationships among descriptors and authors of scientific papers. It creates an interactive interface between the user’s cognitive space and document information space. The system was evaluated by the group of 138 psychology students which have performed a variety of search tasks, using both the classic text-based and the visualization based IR systems. The SCIViS model has proved to be effective and intuitive. Participants were more efficient using the visual IR system, particularly when performing tasks requiring modifications of the initial query and finding alternative keywords. User responses indicated that system’s speed and ease of use are the most important attributes of the overall assessment. They also revealed the impact of users’ previous experience with IR systems on users’ satisfaction and perception of usefulness. Previous experience may be regarded both as the rate of success in performing search tasks, as well as the familiarity with popular search engines. The later one seems to be an important factor in modeling users’ information seeking behavior and their attitudes toward alternative IR models. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Virtual Forest is a web-based, open-access learning environment about forests designed for primary-school pupils between the ages of 10 and 13 years. It is pedagogically designed to develop an understanding of ecology, to enhance conceptual development and to give a holistic view of forest ecosystems. Various learning tools, such as concept maps, activating questions, self-assessment, and other exercises, can be implemented to achieve these goals. The information is presented using the capabilities of hypermedia. The interactive systematic wholeness of nature is presented for the learners, within the context of a forest ecosystem and with examples of a few core ecological phenomena, including the cycling of matter, the flow of energy and population dynamics. The e-learning environment is designed to be used for blended learning, together with face-to-face instruction. Virtual Forest is about Finnish forests, but the pedagogical framework can be adapted for biological education in general. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In this qualitative study, we explored spirituality discourses using survey responses of 141 psychotherapy masters and doctoral students to the following open-ended request: “Please describe how you define spirituality for yourself.” Findings indicated that spirituality discourses played out in the following areas: (a) spirituality as relational connection, (b) spirituality as individually defined, (c) spirituality as relative and unspecific, and (d) spirituality as manifestation of power dynamics. We discussed how these results fit with extant literature on clinical training and spirituality, and we delineated how clinical supervisors and mental health educators can apply these results to their work with graduate students.

AB  - While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework (n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development.

AB  - As John Brekke has observed, social work does not use the word “science” to define itself, suggesting a need to articulate a science of social work. This article discusses the science of social work and its relationship to social work practice in the United States, arguing that a “rapprochement” between practice and science should be effected to their mutual benefit. It begins by unpacking both the definitions of social work and of science; considers epistemologies; and underlines the importance of theory in social work science and practice. The article concludes with ideas for identifying common ground and enhancing the practices of both scientists and practitioners in our field. These suggestions include acknowledging shared aims of improving care and services, fully embracing methodological pluralism, using theories and exploring domains within the field that are important to both practitioners and scientists, developing sustainable structures where scientists and practitioners can come together on an equal footing to learn from each other and to collaborate in practice-relevant research, and developing a knowledge broker service for practitioners.

AB  - Three themes are central to preparing doctoral students for the professoriate: identity formation, scientific integration, and intellectual communities. In this article, we argue that these three themes are not separate pillars but interlocking circles. Our main thesis is that (1) social work must develop into a distinct integrative scientific discipline; (2) this recognition is core to the identity formation of doctoral scholars and, reflectively, their identity formation is central to the future development of social work as a scientific discipline; and (3) the sustainability of social work as a scientific discipline is dependent upon the development of intellectual communities. Developing social work as an integrative discipline will foster and congeal the identity of our scholars while allowing them to flourish within intellectual communities. Implications include nurturing a scientific sense of identity through a dialogical approach to doctoral education, creating and supporting intellectual communities, and making identity formation explicit in mentoring practices.

AB  - Large content networks like the World Wide Web contain huge amounts of information that have the potential of being integrated because their components fit within common concepts and/or are connected through hidden, implicit relationships. One attempt at such an integration is the program called the 'Web of Data,' which is an evolution of the Semantic Web. It targets semi-structured information sources such as Wikipedia and turns them into fully structured ones in the form of Web-based databases like DBpedia and then integrates them with other public databases such as Geonames. On the other hand, the vast majority of the information residing on the Web is still totally unstructured, which is the starting point for our approach that aims to integrate unstructured information sources. For this purpose, we exploit techniques from Probabilistic Topic Modeling, in order to cluster Web pages into concepts (topics), which are then related through higher-level concept networks; we also make implicit semantic relationships emerge between single Web pages. The approach has been tested through a number of case studies that are here described. While the applicative focus of the research reported here is on knowledge integration on the specific and relevant case of the WWW, the wider aim is to provide a framework for integration generally applicable to all complex content networks where information propagates from multiple sources.

AB  - A novel approach utilizing automated Raman microspectroscopic mapping for gunshot residue (GSR) detection was investigated. A well-established technique for GSR recovery (tape lifting) was utilized for GSR particle collection. Uncontaminated samples of the substrate (tape), organic GSR (OGSR), and inorganic GSR (IGSR) particles were characterized to generate three respective Raman spectroscopic training sets. Automated Raman mapping was used to rapidly collect spectra over areas of the tape substrate populated with GSR particles. Raman spectra collected from the maps were classified against the training sets via partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) to determine if GSR was present. We report the application of Raman chemical mapping as a proof of concept for the positive detection of GSR particles of varying morphologies. The estimated size of GSR particles, which could be readily detected by this method, is about 3.4 μm. The efficiency of the classification was quantitated with rates of true positives and negatives. Validation studies scrutinizing the practicality of this approach as a viable tool for potential forensics investigations are currently in progress. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper presents a model of how children generate concrete concepts from perception through processes of differentiation and integration. The model informs the design of a novel methodology (evolutionary mapsoremaps), whose implementation on certain domains unfolds the web of itineraries that children may follow in the construction of concrete conceptual knowledge and pinpoints, for each conception, the architecture of the conceptual change that leads to the scientific concept. Remarkably, the generative character of its syntax yields conceptions that, if unknown, amount to predictions that can be tested experimentally. Its application to the diurnal cycle (including the sun's trajectory in the sky) indicates that the model is correct and the methodology works (in some domains). Specifically, said emap predicts a number of exotic trajectories of the sun in the sky that, in the experimental work, were drawn spontaneously both on paper and a dome. Additionally, the application of the emaps theoretical framework in clinical interviews has provided new insight into other cognitive processes. The field of validity of the methodology and its possible applications to science education are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled "Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)" has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students' learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Reflection is widely regarded as important for learning from practice in Nursing. Academic reflective writing (ARW) is increasingly being used to assess reflective practice. However, there is currently scant literature on ARW, which is extremely complex, requiring students to link their own experiences to published literature. There are also concerns in the literature about the validity of ARW as a medium of assessment. In this paper, an exploratory discussion on ARW is illustrated with reference to the views of 8 self-selected students on a course for post-registered nurses. These students found ARW extremely challenging, and highlighted a range of difficulties associated with it. In conclusion, it is argued that the student experience of ARW warrants further investigation. In addition, it is suggested that either scaffolding should be put in place to facilitate the production of successful ARW, or alternatives should be explored. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper reports on teachers' use of concept mapping as an alternative assessment strategy in advanced level biology classes and its effects on students' cognitive skills on selected biology concepts. Using a mixed methods approach, the study employed a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design involving 156 students and 8 teachers from intact classes. A researcher-constructed Biology Cognitive Skills Test was used to collect the quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected through interviews and students' personal documents. The data showed that the participants utilized concept mapping in various ways and they described positive experiences while being engaged in its use. The main challenge cited by teachers was the limited time available for more consistent use. The results showed that the use of concept mapping in advanced level biology can lead to learning gains that exceed those achieved in classes where mainly traditional methods are used. The students in the concept mapping experimental groups performed significantly better than their peers in the control group on both the lower-order (F(1) = 21.508;p < .001) and higher-order (F(1) = 42.842,p < .001) cognitive items of the biology test. A mean effect size of .56 was calculated representing the contribution of treatment to the students' performance on the test items. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The "mole" is a fundamental concept in quantitative chemistry, yet research has shown that the mole is one of the most perplexing concepts in the teaching and learning of chemistry. This paper provides a survey of the relevant literature, identifies the necessary components of a sound understanding of the mole concept, and unpacks and presents these components in the form of a concept map. The concept map incorporates the atomic-molecular concept with the mole concept, and connects the two concepts by two linking ideas: the number aspect of the SI definition (linking idea 1) and the connection between relative atomic-molecular mass and molar mass (linking idea 2). This concept map not only provides a conceptual framework for making meaning in relation to the mole but also sheds some light on how the concept might be better taught and learned.

AB  - The promotion of geological and geomorphological heritage is growing in importance for educational initiatives. The constantly increasing interest towards changing landforms due to changing climate conditions asks not only for improving the values of the cultural proposals but also for précising the subject of the discussion. Cultural trails and natural resources valorisation are more and more frequently based on the concept of geomorphosite, which is strictly linked to landform typology definitions. In sensitive areas, changing geomorphosites are considered of great interest as a typical response to changes in climate. In this paper, on the basis of recent research, we discuss the definitions of landforms and geomorphosites activity in relation to surface processes dynamics. In addition, we discuss the implications of geomorphological surface processes for geomorphosite evolution and degradation and their consequent impact on related valorisation activities. We indicate how both active and passive landforms, and therefore geomorphosites, are of great interest for scientific, educational and tourism purposes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background To study the association between organizational context and research utilization in German residential long term care (LTC), we translated three Canadian assessment instruments: the Alberta Context Tool (ACT), Estabrooks' Kinds of Research Utilization (RU) items and the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale. Target groups for the tools were health care aides (HCAs), registered nurses (RNs), allied health professionals (AHPs), clinical specialists and care managers. Through a cognitive debriefing process, we assessed response processes validity-an initial stage of validity, necessary before more advanced validity assessment. Methods We included 39 participants (16 HCAs, 5 RNs, 7 AHPs, 5 specialists and 6 managers) from five residential LTC facilities. We created lists of questionnaire items containing problematic items plus items randomly selected from the pool of remaining items. After participants completed the questionnaires, we conducted individual semi-structured cognitive interviews using verbal probing. We asked participants to reflect on their answers for list items in detail. Participants' answers were compared to concept maps defining the instrument concepts in detail. If at least two participants gave answers not matching concept map definitions, items were revised and re-tested with new target group participants. Results Cognitive debriefings started with HCAs. Based on the first round, we modified 4 of 58 ACT items, 1 ACT item stem and all 8 items of the RU tools. All items were understood by participants after another two rounds. We included revised HCA ACT items in the questionnaires for the other provider groups. In the RU tools for the other provider groups, we used different wording than the HCA version, as was done in the original English instruments. Only one cognitive debriefing round was needed with each of the other provider groups. Conclusion Cognitive debriefing is essential to detect and respond to problematic instrument items, particularly when translating instruments for heterogeneous, less well educated provider groups such as HCAs. Cognitive debriefing is an important step in research tool development and a vital component of establishing response process validity evidence. Publishing cognitive debriefing results helps researchers to determine potentially critical elements of the translated tools and assists with interpreting scores. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Project Clarion, a Jacob K. Javits-funded project, focused on the scale-up of primary-grade science curricula. Curriculum units, based on an Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM), were developed for high-ability learners, but tried out with all students in Title I settings to study the efficacy of the units with all learners. The units focus on the development of students’ conceptual understanding to undergird science content attainment. Teaching and learning models, such as concept formation and concept mapping were used to scaffold science learning and reasoning for appropriate curriculum differentiation. Science content mastery was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reasoning skills were measured using the Test of Critical Thinking. Understanding of macro-concepts and content attainment were measured by curriculum-embedded performance-based assessments. Students with the ICM outperformed students without the specialized curriculum in science content and reasoning skills, and showed greater growth in both conceptual understanding and content attainment.

AB  - Aim To report a review of a genetics education framework using a consensus approach to agree on a contemporary and comprehensive revised framework. Background Advances in genomic health care have been significant since the first genetics education framework for nurses was developed in 2003. These, coupled with developments in policy and international efforts to promote nursing competence in genetics, indicated that review was timely. Design A structured, iterative, primarily qualitative approach, based on a nominal group technique. Method A meeting convened in 2010 involved stakeholders in UK nursing education, practice and management, including patient representatives ( n = 30). A consensus approach was used to solicit participants' views on the individual/family needs identified from real-life stories of people affected by genetic conditions and the nurses' knowledge, skills and attitudes needed to meet those needs. Five groups considered the stories in iterative rounds, reviewing comments from previous groups. Omissions and deficiencies were identified by mapping resulting themes to the original framework. Anonymous voting captured views. Educators at a second meeting developed learning outcomes for the final framework. Findings Deficiencies in relation to Advocacy, Information management and Ongoing care were identified. All competencies of the original framework were revised, adding an eighth competency to make explicit the need for ongoing care of the individual/family. Conclusion Modifications to the framework reflect individual/family needs and are relevant to the nursing role. The approach promoted engagement in a complex issue and provides a framework to guide nurse education in genetics/genomics; however, nursing leadership is crucial to successful implementation.

AB  - With a growing interest in sustainability, a number of universities have engaged in educating the future leaders, decision makers, scientists, and engineers on how their decisions can help societies become more sustainable. This paper presents the process for developing the Bachelor's degree curriculum in Engineering for Sustainable Development at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico. The process was initiated in response to a request from top management of the university to a small committee of faculty members to prepare a draft of the degree's curriculum structure. Subsequently, a wider committee was appointed to design the courses' content and to refine the degree's structure. The process of developing a new degree posed a number of challenges, such as connectivity of courses and the curricular contribution to sustainability. These challenges were overcome by: using Concept Maps to help characterise and to overcome the challenges of inter-connecting courses by providing a systemic framework through a qualitative graphical tool titled, the ‘Sustainability Tool for Assessing UNiversities’ Curricula Holistically’ (STAUNCH®). This tool helped the faculty team to develop a quasi-quantitative approach to the courses' coverage and their individual and collective contribution to education of their students for sustainability. The two methods provided a broader, more holistic, and systemic approach when developing a degree, because it allowed assessing the needed connectivity among curriculum courses from a systemic perspective, as well as evaluating the contribution of environmental, economic, and social issues in the degree. The systematic process followed in developing this degree curriculum can help other institutions to design and implement their own sustainability curricula. This can ensure that they develop sustainability-educated and empowered students, who can be change agents in making societies more sustainable. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Physical education and health education are relevant avenues for adolescents to learn knowledge and behavior related to energy-balanced living. Grounded in the framework theory of conceptual change, this study examined ninth graders' energy balance knowledge (i.e., concepts, principles, and strategies underlying the scientific mechanism and the outcome of energy balanced/imbalanced living) and physical activity in a healthful-living curriculum (i.e. combination of physical education and health). The students (N =195) were measured using concept mapping, accelerometers, and three-day physical activity recall. It was found that the students differed in energy balance knowledge where most (83%) lacked a higher-order relational understanding. Physical activity in physical education class or after school did not significantly differ by students' mental model levels concerning energy balance knowledge. The findings suggest that an ecological learning context with moderate physical activity should be provided to help students make sense of energy balance knowledge through lived experiences.

AB  - This review assesses the use of anthropological theories in the examination of low-wage work. Due to the vast differences existing between different cultures in low-wage work, this review focuses on theories that have been applied in Western, and mainly American, contexts. There are primarily three fields from which this literature is drawn: economic anthropology, gender and race anthropology, and theories of power—the last integrates all these theories. Differences and controversies over the applicability of these theories are also highlighted. The review concludes with a conceptual map describing the interrelatedness of these theories and how they explain the realities of low-wage workers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction: Considering the importance, complexity, and problems in nursing education, using efficient and new methods in nursing education seems to be necessary. One of the most important of these methods which has received attention in recent years is the use of concept maps. Therefore, the aim of this study was systematic review of studies conducted in this field. Methods: Required information for this systematic review study was collected using keywords of concept map, learning, retention, nursing education, critical thinking skill, and Iran and their English synonyms in data bases of Iranmedex, Magiran, Science Direct, PubMed, Google scholar, Medlib, and SID. No time limitation was considered for searching articles. Articles published in Farsi and English have been searched. Results: Results show that concept maps have a significant effect on improving critical thinking of learners. Compared to other educational methods such as lectures; using concept maps show higher efficiency in deep and meaningful learning. Besides, concept maps have a significant effect on learning (relationship of theory and practice, improvement of clinical experiences, organizing concepts, and self-regulation). Conclusion: According to the importance of nursing education and its available problems on one hand, and the use and applicability of concept maps on the other hand (as well as ignorance about this educational method), it seems necessary to plan for the development of using concept maps in educational nursing.

AB  - Borders are as much social and historical constructs as they are physical entities and run through geographies of the mind as well as over physical landscapes. It is in the borderlands that the narratives of nationhood begin to crumble, where they must be upheld through the full range of the techniques of domination. This paper examines three facets of the maintenance of borders of the post-Independence Indian nation-state. First, the creation of maps which are not mere instruments of utility or direct transcriptions of reality but rather a mixture of historical and political meanings and aspirations. Indian laws regarding maps and borders criminalize any representations of these which do not conform to the official version, even if used for purposes of political or academic discussion or debate. Such laws draw upon archaic, nineteenth century notions of sedition, and in seeking to uphold the “territorial integrity of the nation” serve only to highlight the arbitrary and contingent nature of national boundaries. Second, the laws of exception in effect in the borderlands of Kashmir and the northeast, which give the Indian military absolute power in dealing with the civilian population. In providing immunity from prosecution to military personnel accused of human rights violations, they serve to define the population of the borderlands as those who may be killed with impunity. Third, the maintenance of borders in the mind through public spectacles and displays such as the trial and sentencing of Afzal Guru, a Kashmiri Muslim executed by India, for his alleged role in the attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. Anthropological writing on sacrifice, particularly the classic work of Hubert and Mauss, is relevant to understanding the meanings and consequences of this performance as it relates to the construction of the national community, its borders and its enemies.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the effects of using mind maps and concept maps on students' learning of concepts in science courses. A total of 51 students participated in this study which used a quasi-experimental research design with pre-test/post-test control groups. The constructivist-inspired study was carried out in the sixth-grade science course unit of ‘Light and Sound’ in a primary school with two experimental groups and one control group. The intervention was held in the experimental group 1 by using technology-assisted technique of mind mapping, in the experimental group 2 by using technology-assisted technique of concept mapping, and in the control group by means of traditional classroom instruction. After the intervention in the experimental groups, concept tests and open-ended questions related to the unit were used as post-tests. According to the data obtained from concept tests, it was found out that all groups' understanding of concepts was equivalent. Significantly, students in the experimental group 2 reported positive opinions, stating that learning through concept maps was useful and engaging. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The co-evolution model of collaborative knowledge building by Cress and Kimmerle (2008) assumes that cognitive and social processes interact when users build knowledge with shared digital artifacts. While these assumptions have been tested in various lab experiments, a test under natural field conditions in educational settings has not been conducted. Here, we present a field experiment where we triggered knowledge co-evolution in an accommodation and an assimilation condition, and measured effects on student knowledge building outside the laboratory in the context of two university courses. Therefore, 48 students received different kinds of prompts that triggered external accommodation and assimilation while writing a wiki text. Knowledge building was measured with a content analysis of the students' texts and comments (externalization), and with concept maps and association tests (internalization). The findings reveal that (a) different modes of externalization (accommodation and assimilation) could be triggered with prompts, (b) across both conditions, this externalization co-occurred with internalization (student learning), and (c) there is some evidence that external assimilation and accommodation had differential effects on internal assimilation and accommodation. Thus, the field experiment supports the assumptions of the co-evolution model in a realistic course setting. On a more general note, the study provides an example of how wikis can be used successfully for collaborative knowledge building within educational contexts. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Many recent studies have reported the benefits of educational computer games in promoting students' learning motivations. On the other hand, however, the effect of digital game-based learning in improving students' learning performance has been questioned. Several previous studies have reported that without properly integrating learning strategies into gaming scenarios, the effectiveness of educational computer games could be limited, or may be even worse than that of the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In this study, a concept map-embedded gaming approach is proposed for developing educational computer games by integrating concept mapping as part of the gaming scenarios to help students organize what they have learned during the game-based learning process. Moreover, a role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school natural science course based on the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the concept map-embedded gaming approach can significantly improve the students' learning achievement and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach revealed a significantly higher degree of perceived usefulness than those who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach.

AB  - TWENTY-TWO COLLEGE STUDENTS who were deaf viewed one instructional video with standard captions and a second with expanded captions, in which key terms were expanded in the form of vocabulary definitions, labeled illustrations, or concept maps. The students performed better on a posttest after viewing either type of caption than on a pretest; however, there was no difference in comprehension between standard and expanded captions. Camtasia recording software enabled examination of the extent to which the students accessed the expanded captions. The students accessed less than 20% of the available expanded captions. Thus, one explanation for the lack of difference in comprehension between the standard and expanded captions is that the students did not access the expanded captions sufficiently. Despite limited use of the expanded captions, the students stated, when interviewed, that they considered these captions beneficial in learning from the instructional video. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: This study was undertaken with the goal of developing a Concept Map Knowledge Management System (CMKMS) for use as a tool in observing change in a student's understanding of biology concepts over time. The CMKMS should be useful in assessing the extent of a student's knowledge and in revealing their unique thought processes. The study was concerned not only with a student's self-evaluation of learning but also with their level of satisfaction after using the CMKMS. The CMKMS combines the diagnosis of concept mapping with the style of thought processing, and promotes teaching activities step-by-step, in order to promote effective student learning. In analyzing the factors that influence the effect of teaching, the teacher can determine a student's knowledge structure and highlight misconceptions by inspecting the concept maps and logs. The results of this study show that knowledge management involved in computer-aided instruction in the teaching of biology had a positive influence on learning effectiveness. The CMKMS also was useful in promoting the student's thought processing, creativity, and ability to judge. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Conflict theory attempts to understand conflicts in terms of power, communication, needs, desires, and moral controls. In terms of the present discussion regarding violence and religion, conflict theory focuses on questions of morals and authority, the violation of norms, moral exclusion, and communication patterns. Moral systems that understand their source as being in revealed truth can categorize those who do not have the same beliefs as being radically other. This categorization is frequently based on the perceived level of threat presented by others. As such, persons and groups who do not have the same religious, or moral, beliefs may not be included in the system of justice, or morality, of the group. This dynamic has the potential of producing nonproductive communication patterns and potentially justifying and sustaining violence. From this perspective, overcoming violence requires reexamination of fundamental moral presuppositions, redefinition of what is understood as a threat to the group, and transformation of ingrained patterns of communication.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use a comparative approach to scrutinize the common assumption that certain school science activities are theoretical and therefore particularly suited for engaging students with scientific ideas, whereas others are practical and, thus, not equally conducive to engagement with scientific ideas. We compared two school science activities, one (laboratory work) that is commonly regarded as focusing attention on artefacts that may distract students from central science concepts and the other (concept mapping) that is thought to make students focus directly on these concepts. We observed students in either a laboratory activity about real galvanic cells or a concept-mapping activity about idealized galvanic cells. We used a practical epistemology analysis to compare the two activities regarding students' actions towards scientific ideas and artefacts. The comparison revealed that the two activities, despite their alleged differences along the theory–practice scale, primarily resulted in similar student actions. For instance, in both activities, students interacted extensively with artefacts and, to a lesser extent, with scientific ideas. However, only occasionally did students establish any explicit continuity between artefacts and scientific ideas. The findings indicate that some of the problems commonly considered to be unique for school science practical work may indeed be a feature of school science activities more generally.

AB  - Research that partners with youth and community stakeholders increases contextual relevance and community buy-in and therefore maximizes the chance for intervention success. Concept mapping is a mixed-method participatory research process that accesses the input of the community in a collaborative manner. After a school-wide health needs assessment at a low-income, minority/immigrant K–8 school identified bullying and obesity as the most important health issues, concept mapping was used to identify and prioritize specific strategies to address these two areas. Stakeholders including 160 K–8 students, 33 college students working in the school, 35 parents, 20 academic partners, and 22 teachers/staff brainstormed strategies to reduce and prevent obesity and bullying. A smaller group of stakeholders worked individually to complete an unstructured sorting of these strategies into groups of similar ideas, once for obesity and again for bullying. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis was applied to the sorting data to produce a series of maps that illustrated the stakeholders’ conceptual thinking about obesity and bullying prevention strategies. The maps for both obesity and bullying organized specific strategies into themes that included education, parental role, teacher/school supervision, youth role, expert/professional role, and school structure/support.

AB  - Background: Medical student education is challenging, and concept maps (CMs) can help students link new and existing knowledge, promote critical thinking and identify knowledge gaps. Aims: To study the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of CMs in problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials. Method: Students and tutors were randomized to tutorials that used or did not use CMs. A mixed-methods approach generated qualitative and quantitative results of participants' perspectives on and the effects of CMs in PBL tutorials. Results: Student survey response rate was 71% (122/172). Most students (82.6%) planned to use CMs in the future at least occasionally, and students in CM tutorials endorsed increased likelihood of using CMs in the future ( p = 0.02) versus students in non-CM tutorials. Qualitative analyses identified consistent associations between CMs and recurrent themes: integration of physiological mechanisms, challenging students' knowledge of the material, and identification of knowledge gaps. Quantitative assessment of final exam scores revealed a statistically significant increase in the students' scores in CM tutorials versus students in non-CM tutorials with an a priori α of <0.10. Conclusions: CMs are well accepted by students and faculty, feasible to incorporate into PBL tutorials, and may result in improved exam performance and student learning of physiologic concepts.

AB  - <?Pub Dtl?>This paper proposes a scaffolded concept mapping strategy, which considers a student's (high or low) prior knowledge, and provides flexible learning aids (scaffolding and fading) for reading and drawing a concept map. The goal is that the whole class should progress in synchronized fashion through this strategy, with each student achieving meaningful learning. The scaffolding is tailored to the student's needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated software, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy. The paper also investigates whether this strategy improved student learning for 54 undergraduates in a database management system course. The results indicate that the students who used the strategy had better learning achievements than those who only experienced traditional lectures. Moreover, the implementation of the strategy received positive student feedback. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Printed books have long been an important means for people to obtain knowledge; nevertheless, educators have pointed out problems of learning from some printed books, in particular, the lack of learning supports, such as supplementary materials and learning guiding tools. In this study, a concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is proposed for supporting printed science book reading activities for children via mobile devices with QR-code facilities. A quasi-experiment has been conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 92 sixth graders participated. The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is significantly more helpful to the students in reading printed books than traditional book reading and the conventional ubiquitous learning approach in terms of learning achievements; moreover, the students had a high level of acceptance of such a mobile technology-assisted learning system in terms of "ease of use", "usefulness" and "attitude and intention of future use."

AB  - Concept maps have become a widely used educational tool around the globe. The advancements in computerized interface technologies have enabled even more alternatives for using concept maps in teaching and learning. This study investigates the effects of two different touch technology-based concept mapping interaction modes on students' learning achievements and learning attitudes in a natural science course, as well as their degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn. Ninety two sixth graders were randomly divided into three groups. Experimental Group One was taught using the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB)-based concept mapping approach, Experimental Group Two learned with the touchscreen-based concept mapping approach, while the control group learned with the traditional paper-and-pencil-based concept mapping approach. The experimental results show that, in terms of learning attitudes toward the natural science course and the degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn, the students were significantly more positive about the two touch technology-based interaction modes than they were about the traditional paper-and-pencil mode.

AB  - We study the misconceptions about colour that most people hold, determining the general phenomenological laws that govern them. Concept mapping was used to combat the misconceptions which were found in the application of a test specifically designed to determine these misconceptions, while avoiding the possible misleading inductions that could have arisen from the use of everyday language. In particular, care was taken to avoid the distorting effect that the use of the verb ‘to be’ applied to coloured objects could have on the responses. The misconceptions found were shown to have an internal consistency in the form of authentic mini-theories (implicit theories). We compared experimentally the results of two different teaching methods applied to combat these misconceptions. This study was conducted with 470 undergraduates of the University of Extremadura. We analysed the persistence over time of their learning made to overcome those misconceptions. The students were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). To combat their misconceptions, EG were taught following a method based on the use of concept maps, and CG were taught following traditional teaching methods. The results of a pre-test and a post-test were compared for the two groups, finding statistically significant differences. The results allowed the principal working hypothesis to be accepted—concept maps are learning tools which foster conceptual change and allow misconceptions to be eradicated via meaningful learning maintained over time, i.e. EG acquired a relative long-lasting gain in learning that was superior to that acquired by CG.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers' convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students' vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers' use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool.

AB  - Background:  Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is an interactive, case-based conference for medical students designed to: (1) integrate preclinical and clinical learning; (2) promote inductive clinical reasoning; and (3) emphasise students as peer teachers. CPGR specifically encourages mixed learning level student interactions and emphasises the use of concept mapping. We describe the theoretical basis and logistical considerations for an interactive, integrative, mixed-learner environment such as CPGR. In addition, we report qualitative data regarding students' attitudes towards and perceptions of CPGR. Context:  Medical students from first to fourth year participate in a monthly, interactive conference. Programme description:  The CPGR was designed to bridge gaps and reinforce linkages between basic science and clinical concepts, and to incorporate interactive vertical integration between preclinical and clinical students. Medical education and content experts use Socratic, interactive teaching methods to develop real-time concept maps to emphasise the presence and importance of linkages across curricula. Programme evaluation:  Student focus groups were held to assess attitudes towards and perceptions of the mixed-learner environment and concept maps in CPGR. Qualitative analyses of focus group transcripts were performed to develop themes and codes describing the students' impressions of CPGR. Discussion:  CPGR is a case-based, interactive conference designed to help students gain an increased appreciation of linkages between basic science and clinical medicine concepts, and an increased awareness of clinical reasoning thought processes. Success is dependent upon explicit attention being given to goals for students' integrated learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The greenhouse effect is a reasonably complex scientific phenomenon which can be used as a model to examine students' conceptual understanding in science. Primary student-teachers' understanding of global environmental problems, such as climate change and ozone depletion, indicates that they have many misconceptions. The present mixed method study examines Finnish primary student-teachers' understanding of the greenhouse effect based on the results obtained via open-ended and closed-form questionnaires. The open-ended questionnaire considers primary student-teachers' spontaneous ideas about the greenhouse effect depicted by concept maps. The present study also uses statistical analysis to reveal respondents' conceptualization of the greenhouse effect. The concept maps and statistical analysis reveal that the primary student-teachers' factual knowledge and their conceptual understanding of the greenhouse effect are incomplete and even misleading. In the light of the results of the present study, proposals for modifying the instruction of climate change in science, especially in geography, are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E.G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C.G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E.G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C.G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E.G. students as compared with the C.G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E.G. students' learning was greater than 19 percentage points. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background:This study combines work on concept mapping with scripted collaborative learning. Purpose:The objective was to examine the effects of self-regulated science learning through scripting students’ argumentative interactions during collaborative ‘multimedia-enriched skeleton concept mapping’ on meaningful science learning and retention. Programme description:Each concept in the enriched skeleton concept map (ESCoM) contained annotated multimedia-rich content (pictures, text, animations or video clips) that elaborated the concept, and an embedded collaboration script to guide students’ interactions. Sample:The study was performed in a Biomolecules course on the Bachelor of Applied Science program in the Netherlands. All first-year students (N=93, 31 women, 62 men, aged 17–33 years) took part in this study. Design and methods:The design used a control group who received the regular course and an experimental group working together in dyads on an ESCoM under the guidance of collaboration scripts. In order to investigate meaningful understanding and retention, a retention test was administered a month after the final exam. Results:Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant experimental effect on the Biomolecules exam scores between the experimental group and the control, and the difference between the groups on the retention test also reached statistical significance. Conclusions:Scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping resulted in meaningful understanding and retention of the conceptual structure of the domain, the concepts, and their relations. Not only was scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping more effective than the traditional teaching approach, it was also more efficient in requiring far less teacher guidance.

AB  - This article describes a cultural mapping tool developed specifically for working with Aboriginal people experiencing mental health problems. The tool has broad scope, drawing from ecological and systems approaches. It will assist social workers to understand cultural and family obligations and build relationships with Aboriginal service users. Students learning about cultural diversity have expressed concern about asking culturally-sensitive questions. Australian human service workers typically state they feel inadequate in addressing Aboriginal culture in their practice approaches. The three components of the cultural mapping toolbox, (a) the social and emotional wellbeing cluster map, (b) the community and cultural diversity map, and (c) the migration map, provide social workers with a way of supporting a culturally connected lifestyle in contemporary society.

AB  - This paper reports on a complex environmental approach to addressing ‘wicked’ health promotion problems devised to inform policy for enhancing food security and physical activity among Māori, Pacific and low-income people in New Zealand. This multi-phase research utilized literature reviews, focus groups, stakeholder workshops and key informant interviews. Participants included members of affected communities, policy-makers and academics. Results suggest that food security and physical activity ‘emerge’ from complex systems. Key areas for intervention include availability of money within households; the cost of food; improvements in urban design and culturally specific physical activity programmes. Seventeen prioritized intervention areas were explored in-depth and recommendations for action identified. These include healthy food subsidies, increasing the statutory minimum wage rate and enhancing open space and connectivity in communities. This approach has moved away from seeking individual solutions to complex social problems. In doing so, it has enabled the mapping of the relevant systems and the identification of a range of interventions while taking account of the views of affected communities and the concerns of policy-makers. The complex environmental approach used in this research provides a method to identify how to intervene in complex systems that may be relevant to other ‘wicked’ health promotion problems.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of models of programmed instruction and conventional (informative-illustrative) expository teaching in terms of fulfilling the aims of the course ‘Human anatomy and physiology’ which is included in the physiology programme and designed for undergraduate students majoring in biology education at the Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade. For this purpose, a model of a pedagogical experiment with parallel groups of students was applied. One group was presented the course content through programmed instruction, with the help of computers and programmed materials, which included the elaboration of concept maps. The second group was presented the same content through expository (informative-illustrative) instruction, the traditional lecturing model. In terms of quantity and quality of knowledge acquired by students in the tested teaching field, the experimental model of programmed instruction was more effective. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Public appreciation and basic understanding of the role the ocean plays in the global environment has become more important as the urgency to make decisions on complex environmental issues has increased. Because communicating science to the public is often challenging for scientists, they can benefit from employing methods such as concept mapping, which "deconstructs" science into discrete ideas and organizes them into graphical formats. Responding to recommendations by ocean science faculty who participated in concept-mapping workshops with pre-college educators, four Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence designed, implemented, and evaluated a series of professional development workshops for graduate students. These workshops engaged 20 faculty-level ocean scientists to help 73 graduate students depict complex scientific ideas using concept maps. Evidence shows that operationally breaking down topics and reorganizing them into graphical formats benefited faculty and graduate students alike. Each workshop culminated with the graduate students delivering oral presentations to nonscientist audiences such as high school students. Graduate students were highly rated on their abilities to place topics within a broad societal context. In a follow-up survey, graduate students recognized the potential of concept mapping to enhance their professional skills and to organize their own research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper proposes a series of design guidelines for implementation into digital game concepts for second and third-age adults based upon results collected from an empirical study. A mixed methods approach was undertaken comprised of game design workshops (Group 1) and observations of participants during game play on the Nintendo Wii™ and Sony PlayStation 2 consoles (Group 2). A mapping process encompassing previous literature keywords, and observations was performed, categorizing three main areas (older adults, technology, and interaction/content). This paper highlights several facets aimed towards the incorporation of design recommendations and rationales for digital game design. To produce games that appeal to a wider or ageing audience, consideration to content variety, choice, and flexibility is important—as is the ease of interaction. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Disability-adjusted-life-years lost (DALYs) is a common outcome metric for cost-effectiveness analyses, and the equations used for such calculations have been presented previously by Fox-Rushby and Hanson (see, e.g., "Health Policy and Planning 16:326-331, 2001"). While the equations are clear, the logic behind them is opaque at best for a large share of public health practitioners and students. The objective of this paper is to show how to calculate DALYs using a discrete time formulation that is easy to teach to students and public health practitioners, is easy to apply for those with basic discounting skills, and is consistent with the discounting methods typically included on the costing side of cost-effectiveness analysis. A continuous-time adjustment factor is derived that can be used to ensure exact consistency between the continuous and discrete time approaches, but this level of precision is typically unnecessary for cost-effectiveness analyses. To illustrate the approach, both a new, simple example and the same example presented in Fox-Rushby and Hanson are used throughout the paper. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Purpose – The purpose of the research reported here is to improve comprehension of the socially-negotiated identity of concepts in the domain of knowledge organization. Because knowledge organization as a domain has as its focus the order of concepts, both from a theoretical perspective and from an applied perspective, it is important to understand how the domain itself understands the meaning of a concept. Design/methodology/approach – The paper provides an empirical demonstration of how the domain itself understands the meaning of a concept. The paper employs content analysis to demonstrate the ways in which concepts are portrayed in KO concept maps as signs, and they are subjected to evaluative semiotic analysis as a way to understand their meaning. The frame was the entire population of formal proceedings in knowledge organization – all proceedings of the International Society for Knowledge Organization's international conferences (1990-2010) and those of the annual classification workshops of the Special Interest Group for Classification Research of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (SIG/CR). Findings – A total of 344 concept maps were analyzed. There was no discernible chronological pattern. Most concept maps were created by authors who were professors from the USA, Germany, France, or Canada. Roughly half were judged to contain semiotic content. Peirceian semiotics predominated, and tended to convey greater granularity and complexity in conceptual terminology. Nodes could be identified as anchors of conceptual clusters in the domain; the arcs were identifiable as verbal relationship indicators. Saussurian concept maps were more applied than theoretical; Peirceian concept maps had more theoretical content. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates important empirical evidence about the coherence of the domain of knowledge organization. Core values are conveyed across time through the concept maps in this population of conference papers. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Methods: Participants were first year medical students (n=150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Results: Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, p<0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). Conclusion: The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry.

AB  - Web-based hypermedia learning environments are widely used in modern education and seem particularly well suited for interdisciplinary learning. Previous work has identified guidance through these complex environments as a crucial problem of their acceptance and efficiency. We reasoned that map-based navigation might provide straightforward and effortless orientation. To achieve this, we developed a clickable and user-oriented concept map-based navigation plugin. This tool is implemented as an extension of Moodle, a widely used learning management system. It visualizes inner and interdisciplinary relations between learning objects and is generated dynamically depending on user set parameters and interactions. This plugin leaves the choice of navigation type to the user and supports direct guidance. Previously developed and evaluated face-to-face interdisciplinary learning materials bridging physiology and physics courses of a medical curriculum were integrated as learning objects, the relations of which were defined by metadata. Learning objects included text pages, self-assessments, videos, animations, and simulations. In a field study, we analyzed the effects of this learning environment on physiology and physics knowledge as well as the transfer ability of third-term medical students. Data were generated from pre- and posttest questionnaires and from tracking student navigation. Use of the hypermedia environment resulted in a significant increase of knowledge and transfer capability. Furthermore, the efficiency of learning was enhanced. We conclude that hypermedia environments based on Moodle and enriched by concept map-based navigation tools can significantly support interdisciplinary learning. Implementation of adaptivity may further strengthen this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Prior research has shown that people are likely to skim information presented digitally with the resultant deleterious effect on accurate mental models of the text. Teaching monitoring strategies and presenting text with adjunct questions are effective strategies for improving the mental models of readers of scientific text, but the two strategies have not been directly compared for studying text read from a computer screen. In the present study, participants were individually tested in two experiments in which they studied computer-based text on the heart and circulatory system while either reading the text with no interruption, answering adjunct inference questions, answering adjunct factual questions, or answering prompts for global or specific monitoring. Reading time was untimed but looking back was not available. Prompting for global monitoring was most effective for improvement of mental models as measured by scores in diagram drawing, concept map construction, factual memory, and generating inferences. Further, global monitoring did not require more time-on-task than the other methods. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Abstract: Speech recognition is an active process that involves some form of predictive coding. This statement is relatively uncontroversial. What is less clear is the source of the prediction. The dual-stream model of speech processing suggests that there are two possible sources of predictive coding in speech perception: the motor speech system and the lexical-conceptual system. Here I provide an overview of the dual-stream model of speech processing and then discuss evidence concerning the source of predictive coding during speech recognition. I conclude that, in contrast to recent theoretical trends, the dorsal sensory–motor stream is not a source of forward prediction that can facilitate speech recognition. Rather, it is forward prediction coming out of the ventral stream that serves this function. Learning outcomes: Readers will (1) be able to explain the dual route model of speech processing including the function of the dorsal and ventral streams in language processing, (2) describe how disruptions to certain components of the dorsal stream can cause conduction aphasia, (3) be able to explain the fundamental principles of state feedback control in motor behavior, and (4) identify the role of predictive coding in motor control and in perception and how predictive coding coming out of the two streams may have different functional consequences.

AB  - Physiology is often considered a challenging course for students. It is up to teachers to structure courses and create learning opportunities that will increase the chance of student success. In an undergraduate exercise physiology course, concept maps are assigned to help students actively process and organize information into manageable and meaningful chunks and to teach them to recognize the patterns and regularities of physiology. Students are first introduced to concept mapping with a commonly relatable nonphysiology concept and are then assigned a series of maps that become more and more complex. Students map the acute response to a drop in blood pressure, the causes of the acute increase in stroke volume during cardio-respiratory exercise, and the factors contributing to an increase in maximal O2 consumption with cardiorespiratory endurance training. In the process, students draw the integrative nature of physiology, identify causal relationships, and learn about general models and core principles of physiology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Communicating with personnel is difficult if the concept in hand is complex, hard to perceive, has characteristics that are fuzzy in nature and that need a long-term perspective to show the results of them as a real benefit and advantage. Knowledge creation and learning concepts both belong to these kinds of management objects. Both have characteristics that are difficult to manage and lead, and that are difficult to articulate in detail to the organisation. Knowledge creation has long been one of the key concepts in modern management science and research. Learning, however, has not achieved that high a status. Many contemporary scientists like to bring in new constructs to better understand the mechanisms behind knowledge creation and learning; however, measuring these kinds of abstract concepts needs support from theory as well as methodology, so that communication to personnel can be objective and, from a management point view, effective. In this research, we have used Internet-based computer applications to measure current knowledge creation and learning levels, and to gain insight into how members of organisations are willing to show their proactive vision, as well as priorities in knowledge creation and learning concepts, inside their organisation. Practical asymmetries can be shown with test subjects, which are important to understand from a leadership and management point of view. The dataset used for this article contains academic and private organisations. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - stubbings l., chaboyer w. & mcmurray a. (2012) Nurses' use of situation awareness in decision-making: an integrative review. Journal of Advanced Nursing 68(7), 1443-1453. Abstract Aim. To critically review the literature related to situation awareness and clinical decision-making by nurses. Background.  International recognition that situation awareness positively contributes to clinical decision-making has led to a growing body of healthcare literature. To date, research has predominately focused on anaesthetists and surgeons using measurement frameworks from the aviation industry. The evidence focussing directly on situation awareness in decision-making by nurses remains limited. Data sources.  Databases: PROQUEST, Web of Science, CINAHL, and PUBMED. Review methods. An integrative review was undertaken following an extensive literature search with the date range January 1965 - March 2011. English language literature reviews, primary qualitative, quantitative and mixed method studies describing situation awareness in decision-making by or including nurses were included. Results.  Five empirical studies of nurses' situation awareness were reviewed. Of these, three included decision-making and situation awareness by nurses in inter-professional teams; two related solely to situation awareness and decision-making by nurses. Findings from the five studies could be grouped under three themes: individual factors influencing situation awareness, interpersonal behaviours influencing situation awareness and situation awareness improving working relationships and patient care. Conclusion.  Further investigation is needed to identify the situation awareness skills that are vital to decision-making by nurses. Elucidating essential skills sets associated with situation awareness may inform the development of education and training to enhance clinical decision-making by nurses. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In recent years, e-learning has been used in a chemical engineering subject in the final course of a mining engineering degree, a subject concerned with fuel technology. The low results obtained by students in this subject have led the teacher to search for new strategies to increase grades. Such strategies have consisted of incorporating into the existing virtual environment a dynamics of work with conceptual maps and a consideration of the different learning styles in the classroom. In an attempt to adapt teaching to the individual methods of learning for each student, various activities aimed at strengthening different learning styles have been proposed and concept maps have been used to create meaningful learning experiences. In addition, different modalities of assessment have been proposed, which can be selected by each student according to his or her particular method of learning to avoid penalising one style preference in contrast to another. This combination of e-learning, use of concept maps and catering for different learning styles has involved the implementation of the improved virtual learning environment. This has led to an increase in participation in the subject and has improved student assessment results. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Formal cross-sector research networks in Canada face enormous organizational challenges to attain the goals of enhancing the economic and social relevance of science, attracting and retaining world-class researchers, fostering innovation, and improving science communication between societal sectors. This paper presents the results of an exploratory concept mapping policy Delphi exercise that aimed to map the essential characteristics of an ideal cross-sector research network in the natural resource sector. The results suggest that the most important and feasible design features for a future research network are the scope of research, knowledge management and knowledge exchange, which relate to three critical functions of research networks: knowledge production, coordination, and translation. The results also suggest that a future research network should involve all stakeholders affected by, and affecting, natural resource management and that the network be flexible and responsive to various stakeholders' research needs.

AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill‐structured and interconnected. Concept‐mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill‐structured. Evaluations of concept‐mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade‐point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis’ Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept‐mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In an attempt to reveal potential threshold concepts in the field of higher education pedagogy, groups of university teachers (in the UK and in Panama) were encouraged to develop personal reflection upon their conceptions of teaching. This was initiated through concept mapping activities. It was hoped that this would help participants to address the perceived differences of teaching between their disciplines whilst coming to recognise the generic factors that may be applicable to teaching across the university context. Consideration of emergent personal models allowed the authors to identify common themes across the disciplines and to align this to established learning theories that may act as a baseline for comparison. The emergent generic model was a modification of Kolb’s learning cycle in which two learning cycles (one for the student and one for the teacher) are linked by the shared concrete experience of the classroom and considered in the context of knowledge structures. The transformation of the morphology of these knowledge structures (oscillating between linear and hierarchical) is seen as fundamental to the successful negotiation of the cycle. The participants’ recognition of this structural transformation is proposed as a threshold concept for the evolution of university teaching. Personal models are described here in relation to the double Kolb cycle to illustrate the potential of this approach to stimulate discussion about university teaching that may encourage a transformation in perspective from delivery and receipt of content towards structural transformation of content.

AB  - The purpose of this research is threefold: (1) to identify the difficulties that Grade 10 students in a Lebanese school have that hinder their conceptual understanding at the micro–macro–symbolic interface in chemistry, (2) to investigate the effect of a macro–micro–symbolic teaching approach on students’ relational understanding of chemical reactions, and (3) to characterize students’ conceptual profiles regarding their understanding of chemical reactions in terms of macro, micro, symbolic levels and the relations among them, at the end of the teaching sequence. Forty six 10th graders from two sections participated in the study. A student-centered approach was followed in both sections based on constructivist pedagogy. Hence the teacher played the role of a facilitator who guided students in a meaning making inductive learning process, through questioning, monitoring, validating, and clarifying ideas. Instruction in the experimental group was characterized by macro–micro–symbolic teaching that focuses on the interplay between the levels, integrates various representations, and engages students in an epistemic discourse about the nature of knowing in chemistry. Data sources for the study included a pre-test and two post-intervention tasks: a post-test and a concept map task, in addition to interviews with selected students from both sections. Findings indicated that macro–micro–symbolic teaching enhanced students’ conceptual understanding and relational learning of chemical reactions. Besides, four assertions related to students’ conceptual and epistemological thinking in response to the different teaching approaches are presented. Implications for instruction and for teacher education programs, as well as recommendations for further research, are discussed in light of these findings. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - The paper describes how specific descriptors for the Conservation-Restoration profession have been developed by the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organizations. The result of which is in accordance with the threefold rubric of Knowledge, Skills and Competence as defined by the European Qualifications Framework. Instead of giving a broad general description of level, which is insufficiently expressive, concept mapping has been used to explicitly uncover the topography of Knowledge, Skills and Competence required for access to the profession. The application of this method, originally developed by Novak in 1972 to enhance learning in the sciences, demonstrates that it is possible to elucidate the complex nature of such professions using such a declarative system. Its hierarchical nature and the ease with which links between different elements can be identified aid the construction of an intellectually robust framework, thereby demonstrating its appropriateness. The results suggest that access to the profession can be presented as a framework of interconnected cognitive competencies, which can be expressed as a structural process where each element possesses an individual level of skill and knowledge.

AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject's body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Parental leave and early childhood education and care have gained a high profile in child and family policy fields, and both have been the subject of substantial cross-national mapping, describing and comparing their main features across a range of countries. This article provides overviews on parental leave and early childhood services in affluent countries, and reflections on this mapping. The article argues that such mapping is important and can still be taken further, to give ‘thicker’ descriptions of the policy terrain, but that more of another, related activity is required: exploration of the environment, using maps as one contextual tool to better understand what goes on within this terrain. It offers suggestions for comparative exploration of different national environments including the comparative study of pedagogical theories, values and practices. While the article takes a broadly positive, even enthusiastic, view of comparative work, it acknowledges that it has its dangers too, not least the problems that may arise from the increasing and uncritical acceptance of English as an academic lingua franca. In conclusion, the case is made for comparative research as an instrument for sustaining democracy, through its contribution to critical thought and awareness of alternatives.

AB  - Background: Concept-mapping and interview techniques are used to track knowledge and understanding over the duration of PhD study amongst four students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards their PhDs. This work is in contrast to much PhD supervision research and policy research that focuses on supervisory styles and roles and may decontextualise the topic and disciplinary setting. Purpose: The work investigates the understanding of the process and product in PhD-level research and supervision. Sample: Participants were four students and their supervisor(s). Case studies were based on longitudinal studies conducted over three to four years (the duration of a PhD). The students were all enrolled in lab-based PhDs in one UK-based higher education institution. Three of the four students were international (one EU-based) and three supervisors were from outside the UK. Design and methods: The data provide documentary evidence of the ways in which these supervisors act to facilitate learning and discovery of research processes and an understanding of lab-based science research supervision. In the initial interview (conducted separately with students and supervisors), the interviewee constructed two maps, one on the topic of the PhD and one on the process of a PhD. In subsequent interviews, the student or supervisor reviewed and updated the previously constructed maps. Transcripts of the interviews were made as well. These data draw on 72 interviews and 96 unique concept maps constructed. The challenges of a PhD being both a process of learning (for the student and the supervisor) and a product of a research project are explored using case study analysis of these four pairs. Findings and discussion: Analyses of the collected data suggested that the students focused more on the product of a PhD (completing a thesis and publication), whereas the supervisors concentrated on the process of learning and scientific development. Conclusions: Evidence in the study suggested product/process differences in the student and supervisor conceptualisation of the PhD. This paper offers development towards a research-led pedagogy of supervision that places the process and product of a PhD at the centre of the supervisory relationship. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Background: Bearing in mind the philosophical pedagogical significance of short phrases for the training of researchers in the health care ambit, we hence have studied the aphorisms and striking phrases expressed during the epidemiology course at the Andalusian School of Public Health. Methods: Belonging to the qualitative type and applied through the establishment of a multidisciplinary focus group made up of ten post-graduated students, where one of them acted as a moderator. The collection of information lasted four months. Information was classified in two ways: Firstly, aphorisms and short phrases with a pedagogical impact; and secondly, data with statistical, epidemiological, epistemological, pragmatic, or heuristic component, and for scientific diffusion. It was decided to perform a triangulation that included a descriptive presentation and a basic categorical analysis. The two teachers with a highest interpretative load have been identified Results: A total of 127 elements, regarded as of interest by the focus group, were collected. Forty-four of them (34.6%) were aphorisms, and 83 were short phrases with a pedagogical load (65.3%). Most of all them were classified as statistical elements (35.4%) followed by epistemological (21.3%) and epidemiological (15.7%) elements. There was no tendency towards aphorisms or short phrases (P> 0.05) among the teachers with more informative representation. Conclusion: There has been a tilt in the contents towards the statistical area to the detriment of the epidemiological one. Concept maps have visualized classifications. This sort of qualitative analysis helps the researcher review contents acquired during his/her training process. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper presents the qualitative analysis of data from a 20-year project analyzing the knowledge and attitudes toward science of undergraduate students enrolled in introductory astronomy courses. The data were collected from nearly 10,000 students between 1989 and 2009 via a written survey that included four open-ended questions, inquiring into students' knowledge of scientific inquiry, DNA, computer software, and radiation. Trends in students' responses were arranged into concept maps that depict patterns in student thinking. Students' responses were also compared with criteria established by a sample of scientists. Students were familiar with empiricism in science and understood that science tries to explain the world but were not as attuned to the need to support arguments with evidence as scientists would expect. Students had a narrower conception of DNA, yet often related a blend of accurate and inaccurate ideas. The accuracy of students' descriptions of software increased over time, though they were more likely to approach software from a consumer rather than computer science perspective. Students attended overly much to the dangers of radiation, and the accuracy of responses decreased over time. This research demonstrates that students' ideas about science are less focused than scientists would like. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Objectives: To examine whether the Health System Reforms delivered the promise of being a coherent and mutually supporting reform programme; to identify the underlying programme theory of the reform programme; to reflect on whether lessons have been learned. Methods: Documentary analysis mapping the implicit and explicit programme theories about how the reforms intended to achieve its goals and outcomes. Semi-structured interviews with policy-makers to further understand the programme theory. Results: The Health System Reforms assumed a 'one size fits all' approach to policy implementation with little recognition that some contexts can be more receptive than others. There was evidence of some policy evolution and rebalancing between the reform streams as policy-makers became aware of some perverse incentives and unforeseen consequences. Later elements aimed to restore balance to the system. Conclusions: The Health System Reforms do not appear to comprise a coherent and mutually supportive set of levers and incentives. They appear unbalanced with the centre of gravity favouring suppliers over commissioners. However, recent reform changes have sought to redress this imbalance to some extent, suggesting that lessons have been learned and policies have been adapted over time. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research was to review possible benefits of information ecology concepts for information usage. Ecological change in information science is explained in line with other changes (cognitive, social, and contextual). The research expands an understanding of human information behaviour in the electronic environment with knowledge of information styles, relevance judgments, and academic repositories in the information ecology perspective. Earlier empirical data based on users' surveys, interviews with PhD students and managers are synthesised. Information styles and relevance in traditional and electronic environments are compared. Concept mapping, with the use of CMaps, is applied to structure of topics in a textbook and in final theses. Ecological information usage, ecological relevance and ecological information literacy are determined. Ecological information usage represents concepts, visual thinking and implicit meanings. Two examples of concept maps as ecological tools for learning support and information literacy are mentioned. In conclusion implications for information literacy, learning, design of digital libraries, and personal information management are outlined. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps are graphical representations of relationships among concepts that can be an effective tool for teaching, designing, and organizing information in a variety of library settings. Concept maps can be used wherever training or formal teaching occurs as a visual aid to explain complex ideas. They can also help learners articulate their understanding of a subject area when they create their own concept maps. When using concept mapping as a teaching tool, students may have a more meaningful learning experience when they add information to a concept map that is based on their current knowledge. Concept maps are also an effective design tool for librarians who are planning projects. They can serve as a reference point for project implementation and evaluation, and the same is true for the design of courses, presentations, and library workshops. A concept map based on the content of a course, for example, is valuable when selecting learning outcomes and strategies for teaching and assessment. Concept mapping can be used as a method for capturing tacit or institutional knowledge through the creation and organization of ideas and resources. Librarians can collaborate on concept maps with each other or with non-librarian colleagues to facilitate communication. Resulting maps can be published online and link to documentation and relevant resources. This paper provides an overview of the literature related to concept mapping in libraries. Concrete applications and examples of concept mapping for teaching and learning, designing, and organizing in library settings are then elaborated. The authors draw from their own success and experience with different concept mapping methods and software programs. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Mobile and wireless communication technologies not only enable anytime and anywhere learning, but also provide the opportunity to develop learning environments that combine real-world and digital-world resources. Nevertheless, researchers have indicated that, without effective tools for helping students organize their observations in the field, the mobile learning performance could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes an interactive concept map-oriented approach for supporting mobile learning activities. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhances learning attitudes, but also improves the learning achievements of the students. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Having a difficulty with reading, or being unable to read, has not always been a medical problem. In the late nineteenth century, physicians such as (Broadbent 1872; Hinshelwood 1895) became interested in identifying particular bodies with reading difficulties. This article is focused around the question of 'how' reading difficulties were formed as a concern for medical researchers. It shall be suggested that the existence of acquired word-blindness as a legitimate medical diagnosis had established the inability to read or difficulty with reading as a medical concern, albeit with a different aetiology. This constituted the practical conditions and established a vocabulary that made congenital word-blindness a technically feasible diagnosis. The medical concern for a difficulty with reading was in most cases a concern with how this difficulty could be overcome. The clinical criteria that were negotiated for congenital word-blindness seem to have been negotiated in relation to rationalities of government concerned with capitalising the population. This article forms part of part a wider project to use analytical concepts drawn from Michel Foucault to help map a genealogy of dyslexia. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The ability to appreciate the inter-connectedness of complex biological relationships can be difficult for many students. Graphical knowledge in the form of concept maps and flow charts are learning tools which can assist students to recognise the inter-connectivity. This report focuses on a trial which incorporates these two related visual learning tools using a tablet PC to support their instruction in an undergraduate introductory microbiology class. The objectives of the trial were to introduce both concept maps and flow charts so as to assist students in linking theory with practical knowledge, to make connections within and outside their course of study, and to increase student preparedness and time management in laboratories. An integrated approach to teaching using a pen-based technology with live audio visual in both lectures and laboratories was used. This report details the implementation of the teaching approach focusing on the application of the concept maps and flow charts and how tablet PC technology was incorporated in both settings. The evaluation results of the trial are also reported indicating the impact of the integrated teaching approach on student learning experience and concludes with potential areas for future consideration.

AB  - Abstract: Open ontology learning is the process of extracting a domain ontology from a knowledge source in an unsupervised way. Due to its unsupervised nature, it requires filtering mechanisms to rate the importance and correctness of the extracted knowledge. This paper presents OntoCmaps, a domain-independent and open ontology learning tool that extracts deep semantic representations from corpora. OntoCmaps generates rich conceptual representations in the form of concept maps and proposes an innovative filtering mechanism based on metrics from graph theory. Our results show that using metrics such as Betweenness, PageRank, Hits and Degree centrality outperforms the results of standard text-based metrics (TF-IDF, term frequency) for concept identification. We propose voting schemes based on these metrics that provide a good performance in relationship identification, which again provides better results (in terms of precision and F-measure) than other traditional metrics such as frequency of co-occurrences. The approach is evaluated against a gold standard and is compared to the ontology learning tool Text2Onto. The OntoCmaps generated ontology is more expressive than Text2Onto ontology especially in conceptual relationships and leads to better results in terms of precision, recall and F-measure.

AB  - Building ontology in the domain of human sciences can be a difficult process because of the different meanings given to the same key concepts in these disciplines: in fact, shared meaning is an important element in knowledge construction between members of a community. In this paper, we propose a participatory social environment called 'EduOntoWiki' where academic experts in the field of educational sciences develop lightweight ontologies that members of multiple communities of practice (teachers, trainers, etc.) can modify and integrate using a folksonomic and storytelling approach. In this way, real-life narrative contexts become precious 'tagged' alternative representations that can contribute to the ontology construction process. Experience of the environment gave possible indications regarding its use in teachers' training courses and as a useful tool to discuss evaluation and assessment issues in teachers' professional practice.

AB  - This paper describes the expressed models that children aged 7, 11, and 14 years have about micro-organisms and microbial activity. These were elicited using a variety of data collection techniques that complemented each other, resulting in a rich dataset, and provided information about the level of knowledge and progression of ideas across the age range studied. Subsequent analysis of the data enabled generalised mental models of micro-organisms to be derived that indicate a hierarchy in the sophistication and accuracy of the concepts explored. The resulting mental models were categorised as extended, transitional, and emergent and characterise the ideas held by some children in each of the age groups studied. The implications for curriculum development and consequences for learning and teaching microbiology are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Recent advances in mobile and wireless communication technologies have enabled various new learning approaches which situate students in environments that combine real-world and digital-world learning resources; moreover, students are allowed to share knowledge or experiences with others during the learning process. Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

AB  - This article reports the results of a small-scale curriculum development project focusing on two of the seven 'key concepts' identified in the revised Key Stage 3 (KS3) National Curriculum programme of study for geography, introduced into schools in 2007. The study used 'interdependence' and 'physical processes' as part of a conceptual framework for creating a holistic approach to the subject, underpinned by the notion of threshold concepts. Year 9 students (aged 13-14 years) undertook classroom work investigating atmosphere, oceans, volcanoes and glaciers to develop an understanding of process, landscape, life and futures, while also considering the interdependent nature of these areas, to build an understanding of global physical systems. Use was made of student questioning and concept mapping to create 'liminal spaces' in which students could develop deeper understanding of interdependent processes and patterns. Perceptual results from student and teacher interviews suggest that a holistic curriculum was popular and also led to a greater level of critical understanding and a relational underpinning to approaching the subject.

AB  - Four physiology courses participating in a science education program used concept maps for the first time. At the conclusion of the term, students responded to an end-of-term survey about the activity. Following varied results, we sought to identify factors that students indicated are important for the acceptance of the technique. To encourage high student value of concept map exercises, instructors should consider achieving the following: (1) designing exercises to meet educational goals, (2) providing timely feedback by instructor and peers, and (3) clearly aligning exams/assessments with the concept map exercise. Following these three principles, students will not only value but will also see the connection between the concept map exercise and the course assessments. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate relations between goal orientations, information processing strategies and development of conceptual knowledge of pre-vocational secondary education students (n =719; 14 schools). Students'' preferences for certain types of goals and information processing strategies were examined using questionnaires. Conceptual knowledge was investigated by having students create concept maps before and after a learning project. Structural analyses showed that student preferences for mastery and performance goals positively affected their preferences for the use of deep and surface information processing strategies. Preferences for work avoidance goals negatively influenced preferences for deep and surface processing. Use of surface information processing strategies negatively affected the development of conceptual knowledge. Remarkably, no relation was found between students'' preferences for deep processing strategies and development of conceptual knowledge. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Abstract: The widespread availability of digital learning resources in a variety of media formats has promoted the proliferation of eLearning systems as an integral part of teaching across all sectors of education. However, these systems are rarely planned in advance taking into account its final usefulness. At most, they are validated through learner experience using the final implemented system. In this paper, a scientific technique called concept mapping is proposed to identify the external variables that should be kept in mind while designing an eLearning tool. As a result, improvements can be programmed to increase its utility in the teaching activities prior to its use. The method has been tested in the development of a eLearning system used for advanced microprocessor teaching. Results are shown through two-dimensional maps, in which variables can be seen as clusters or groups of ideas. These variables can be used as a guide for developing an eLearning tool. The reliability of the results is also analyzed to check the correct application of the proposed technique. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - This paper explores the use of a new pedagogy, the rock art stability index (RASI), to engender deeper understanding of weathering science concepts by students. Owing to its dynamic nature, RASI represents a quintessential actor network for weathering science, because it links task in the landscape with an active material practice and an alternative materialistic world-view recently called for in positivistic science, to create place. Using concept maps as an assessment tool, 571 college undergraduate students and 13 junior high school integrated science students (ages 12—13) were evaluated for increased learning potential between pre- and post-field experiences. Further, this article demonstrates that when students use RASI to learn the fundamental complex science of weathering they make in-depth connections between weathering form and process not achieved through traditional, positivistic weathering pedagogy. We argue that RASI draws upon inherent actor networks which allow students to link weathering form and process to an animate conceptualization of landscape. Conceptualizing landscape as sentient actor networks removes weathering science disciplinary connections and their inherent pedagogic practices. Our focus in this paper is not to challenge weathering ontology and epistemology, but rather to argue that there is a need for a pedagogical paradigm shift in weathering science.

AB  - Using visual models is common in science and should become more common in classrooms. Our research group has developed and completed studies on the use of a visual modeling tool, the Concept Connector. This modeling tool consists of an online concept mapping Java applet that has automatic scoring functions we refer to as Robograder. The Concept Connector enables students in large introductory science courses to visualize their thinking through online model building. The Concept Connector's flexible scoring system, based on tested grading schemes as well as instructor input, has enabled >1,000 physiology students to build maps of their ideas about plant and animal physiology with the guidance of automatic and immediate online scoring of homework. Criterion concept maps developed by instructors in this project contain numerous expert-generated or "correct" propositions connecting two concept words together with a linking phrase. In this study, holistic algorithms were used to test automated methods of scoring concept maps that might work as well as a human grader. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Short-term load forecast (STLF) is an important operational function in both regulated power systems and deregulated open electricity markets. However, STLF is not easy to handle due to the nonlinear and random-like behaviors of system loads, weather conditions, and social and economic environment variations. Despite the research work performed in the area, more accurate and robust STLF methods are still needed due to the importance and complexity of STLF. In this paper, a new neural network approach for STLF is proposed. The proposed neural network has a novel learning algorithm based on a new modified harmony search technique. This learning algorithm can widely search the solution space in various directions, and it can also avoid the overfitting problem, trapping in local minima and dead bands. Based on this learning algorithm, the suggested neural network can efficiently extract the input/output mapping function of the forecast process leading to high STLF accuracy. The proposed approach is tested on two practical power systems and the results obtained are compared with the results of several other recently published STLF methods. These comparisons confirm the validity of the developed approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, whereas activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi- experimental studies in which upper-elementary, intermediate, and secondary students with learning disabilities learned from graphic organizers. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 55 standardized mean effect sizes were extracted from 16 articles involving 808 participants. Students at levels ranging from grade 4 to grade 12 used graphic organizers to learn in core-content classes (English/reading, science, social studies, mathematics). Posttests measured near and far transfer. Across several conditions, settings, and features, the use of graphic organizers was associated with increases in vocabulary knowledge, comprehension, and inferential knowledge. Mean effect sizes varied from moderate to large based on type of measure, type of graphic organizer, and subject area. Conclusions, implications for future research, and practical recommendations are presented. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Introduction. We examine relationships between information literacy and information ecology with regard to conceptual innovation in information science. We aim to expand our understanding of human information behaviour and relevance assessment in the electronic environment. Method. Conceptual analysis and conceptual mapping is used and relationships of main concepts are determined in a concept map. Earlier empirical research on information behaviour styles and relevance assessment using surveys and interviews are synthesized. Analysis. Two information styles (pragmatic and analytic) are characterized. Relevance assessment in the electronic environment is analysed. Relevance is considered as part of information literacy. Examples of students' information horizons and a concept map of relevance are given. Results. Ecological dimensions of information literacy are determined at semantic (relevance), visual (information horizon, concept maps) and behavioural and social levels (information styles). A model of ecological dimensions of information literacy is outlined based on triangle of values, tools and communities. Recommendations for development of students' information literacy are presented at levels of information seeking and relevance assessment. Conclusions Implications for information literacy development in the electronic environments and for information and educational strategies are derived. Relevance assessment should be actively trained as part of information literacy and guided inquiry. Ecological dimensions of information literacy can be used in new models of e-learning and digital libraries. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The study examined the effect of concept-mapping and problem --solving teaching strategies on achievement in biology among Nigerian secondary school students. The method used for the study was a quasi-experimental pre-test treatment design. One hundred and thirteen senior secondary three (S.S. 111) students randomly selected from three mixed secondary schools located in Delta North Senatorial District of Delta State, Nigeria were used as subjects for the study. The experimental group was taught selected topics in Genetics using concept-mapping and problem--solving strategies while the control group was taught using the traditional lecture method. The result of the study showed that the experimental group performed significantly better in Genetics than the control group and that gender does not affect students achievement in biology in general.

AB  - One valuable goal of instructional technologies in K-12 education is to prepare students for future learning. Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves this goal. TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn. Students teach their agent by creating concept maps. Artificial intelligence enables TA to use the concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback. Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA exhibited 'added-value' learning that did not adversely affect the 'basic-value' they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time. Moreover, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer using the software. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - For beginning teachers to make the transition to full professional membership they need to increase their professional knowledge of the art and science of teaching. This paper explores the difference in knowledge growth between beginning teachers who commence teaching in fragmented teaching situations in the first two years of teaching, and their colleagues who have stable, secure and continuing employment during this time. This paper argues that the employment context in which beginning teachers take up their profession has a significant, but hitherto largely unacknowledged, effect on the capacity of teachers to develop the craft of teaching (Elbaz, 1983); on their continuing commitment to the profession; and on their self-confidence and self-image as teachers It is concluded that long-term, secure employment in one school, with full responsibility for a class of students and access to effective mentoring, is necessary if beginning teachers are to move beyond 'survival' to developing competency in the first two years of teaching.

AB  - To meet the needs of a diverse student population while addressing the knowledge and skills outcomes of the curriculum, faculty should develop a repertoire of instructional models. Research-based instructional models from the fields of education and health care have been developed to support various learner outcomes. Emphasis on evidence-based practice in the field of communication sciences and disorders should include increased study of research-based instructional practices in higher education. The present study examined the models of instruction currently implemented by professors in speech-language pathology graduate programs. Problem-based learning and induction were used most frequently, followed by direct instruction. Cooperative learning, memory strategy instruction, and role play were used less frequently. Results suggest that instructors are utilizing a variety of instructional models to meet learning outcomes. Implications for the use of models of instruction, as well as future directions for research, are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Abstract: Data were gathered from 248 secondary students (14years old, 56% female) who learned about the circulatory system in 77 self-selected collaborative groups. The learning outcomes of biology students who summarised by collaborative concept mapping were compared with those of students who summarised by collaborative writing. Learning groups randomly assigned to construct concept maps instead of conventional summaries generated more relations in the summary task and their members obtained higher individual scores on a post-test. The concept mapping strategy was found to be advantageous only for students whose cognitive ability was below the median for the sample and who were placed in groups with other students having low cognitive ability.

AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for non-traditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLiM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901,446 in total) for SLiM instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - This paper seeks to develop a methodology that will discover, specify and measure students’ abilities and skills in creating concept maps. Because competencies are the key factor in higher education, the paper analyzes the role of concept maps as a tool to diagnose and improve information analysis, synthesis, organization and representation skills and competencies. We propose a methodology that enables these skills to be evaluated by observing, analyzing and measuring the stages involved in creating a concept map: identification of the main and secondary subjects; subject codification by concepts; grading of concepts; and representation of the concepts and their relationships with labels. A case study using action research methodology tests its usefulness on a group of university students of library and information science. The method proposed provides information on the strengths and weaknesses of the students’ skills, thus enabling their training to be improved by means of specific actions. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - This study used scientometric methods to conduct an automatic content analysis on the development trends of science education research from the published articles in the four journals of International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Research in Science Education, and Science Education from 1990 to 2007. The multi-stage clustering technique was employed to investigate with what topics, to what development trends, and from whose contribution that the journal publications constructed as a science education research field. This study found that the research topic of Conceptual Change & Concept Mapping was the most studied topic, although the number of publications has slightly declined in the 2000’s. The studies in the themes of Professional Development, Nature of Science and Socio-Scientific Issues, and Conceptual Chang and Analogy were found to be gaining attention over the years. This study also found that, embedded in the most cited references, the supporting disciplines and theories of science education research are constructivist learning, cognitive psychology, pedagogy, and philosophy of science.

AB  - Knowledge structures are often represented in the form of networks or maps of concepts. The coherence and connectivity of such knowledge representations is known to be closely related to knowledge production, acquisition and processing. In this study we use network theory in making the clustering and cohesion of concept maps measurable, and show how the distribution of these properties can be interpreted through the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. This approach allows to introduce new concepts of the "energy of cognitive load" and the "entropy of knowledge organization" to describe the organization of knowledge in the concept maps.

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities.

AB  - Our study monitored the cognitive and motivational effects within different educational instruction schemes: On the one hand, teacher-centred versus hands-on instruction; on the other hand, hands-on instruction with and without a knowledge consolidation phase (concept mapping). All the instructions dealt with the same content. For all participants, the hands-on approach as well as the concept mapping adaptation were totally new. Our hands-on approach followed instruction based on “learning at work stations”. A total of 397 high-achieving fifth graders participated in our study. We used a pre-test, post-test, retention test design both to detect students' short-term learning success and long-term learning success, and to document their decrease rates of newly acquired knowledge. Additionally, we monitored intrinsic motivation. Although the teacher-centred approach provided higher short-term learning success, hands-on instruction resulted in relatively lower decrease rates. However, after six weeks, all students reached similar levels of newly acquired knowledge. Nevertheless, concept mapping as a knowledge consolidation phase positively affected short-term increase in knowledge. Regularly placed in instruction, it might increase long-term retention rates. Scores of interest, perceived competence and perceived choice were very high in all the instructional schemes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract: Scientific literacy can be considered as a new demand of post-industrial society. It seems necessary in order to foster education for sustainability throughout students'' academic careers. Universities striving to teach sustainability are being challenged to integrate a holistic perspective into a traditional undergraduate curriculum, which aims at specialization. This new integrative, inter- and transdisciplinary epistemological approach is necessary to cultivate autonomous citizenship, i.e., that each citizen be prepared to understand and participate in discussions about the complex contemporary issues posed by post-industrial society. This paper presents an epistemological framework to show the role of scientific literacy in fostering education for sustainability. We present a set of 26 collaborative concept maps (CCmaps) in order to illustrate an instance of theory becoming practice. During a required course for first-year undergraduate students (ACH 0011, Natural Sciences), climate change was presented and discussed in broad perspective by using CCmaps. We present students'' CCmaps to show how they use concepts from quantitative and literacy disciplines to deal with the challenges posed by the need of achieving a sustainable development.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique used to provide a visual representation of an individual's ideas about a concept or set of related concepts. This paper describes a concept mapping tool using a photograph association technique (CoMPAT) that is considered to be a novel way of eliciting children's ideas. What children at 11 years of age know about particular concepts related to microbial activity is presented and discussed in relation to the effectiveness of CoMPAT as a tool to draw out their ideas. It is proposed that this tool could be used to explore ideas about this and other science concepts from children in other age groups, and where language may be a barrier to participation.

AB  - The consideration of threshold concepts is offered in the context of biological education as a theoretical framework that may have utility in the teaching and learning of biology at all levels. Threshold concepts may provide a mechanism to explain the observed punctuated nature of conceptual change. This perspective raises the profile of periods of conceptual stasis from 'failure to learn' to necessary periods within the normal pattern of student learning. Threshold concepts are seen as points where segmental/linear knowledge structures and cumulative/hierarchical knowledge structures are integrated, resulting in a transformation in understanding. 'Evolution' and 'dynamic transformation' are nominated as candidate threshold concepts within biology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate a collaborative concept-mapping technique that was integrated into coteaching in fourth-grade science classes in order to examine students' performance and attitudes toward the experimental teaching method. There are two fourth-grade science teachers and four classes with a total of 114 students involved in the study This study used a mixed method design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings showed that the two teaching methods obtained significant difference with respect to students' test scores. Using collaborative concept mapping to learn science could increase the opportunity of discussion between peers, thus fostering better organization and understanding the content. In addition, coteaching could enable teachers to share their expertise with one another It could facilitate the implementation of collaborative concept mapping and the construction of student's concept mapping. Team teachers' attitude could affect the students' learning performance. However, some of the students had negative views on drawing concept maps because they found it was troublesome to write down many words, difficult to draw and arrange proposition, and time-consuming. Coteachers' instant feedback and students 'journal writing could guide and examine the students' concept maps to facilitate their cognitive learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: The co-occurrence of mental illness and substance use problems (referred to as "comorbidity" in this paper) is common, and is often reported by service providers as the expectation rather than the exception. Despite this, many different treatment service models are being used in the alcohol and other drugs (AOD) and mental health (MH) sectors to treat this complex client group. While there is abundant literature in the area of comorbidity treatment, no agreed overarching framework to describe the range of service delivery models is apparent internationally or at the national level. The aims of the current research were to identify and describe elements of good practice in current service models of treatment of comorbidity in Australia. The focus of the research was on models of service delivery. The research did not aim to measure the client outcomes achieved by individual treatment services, but sought to identify elements of good practice in services. Methods: Australian treatment services were identified to take part in the study through a process of expert consultation. The intent was to look for similarities in the delivery models being implemented across a diverse set of services that were perceived to be providing good quality treatment for people with comorbidity problems. Results: A survey was designed based on a concept map of service delivery devised from a literature review. Seventeen Australian treatment services participated in the survey, which explored the context in which services operate, inputs such as organisational philosophy and service structure, policies and procedures that guide the way in which treatment is delivered by the service, practices that reflect the way treatment is provided to clients, and client impacts. Conclusions: The treatment of people with comorbidity of mental health and substance use disorders presents complex problems that require strong but flexible service models. While the treatment services included in this study reflected the diversity of settings and approaches described in the literature, the research found that they shared a range of common characteristics. These referred to: service linkages; workforce; policies, procedures and practices; and treatment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Background: This study deals with the application of concept mapping to the teaching and learning of a science topic with secondary school students in Germany. Purpose: The main research questions were: (1) Do different teaching approaches affect concept map structure or students' learning success? (2) Is the structure of concept maps influenced by gender? (3) Is the concept map structure a reliable indicator of students' learning success? Sample: One hundred and forty-nine high-achieving 5th-grade students from four German secondary schools participated in the study. The average age of participants was 10½ years. Gender distribution was balanced. Students produced concept maps working in small, single-sex groups. Design and methods: There were two teaching approaches used: one based upon teacher-centred instruction and one consisting of student-centred learning. Both were followed by a concept-mapping phase. Student groups experienced either one or the other teaching approach. Concept map structures were analysed using of the method of Kinchin, Hay and Adams. We defined three different possible types of concept map structure: spokes, chains and nets. Furthermore, for assessing a student's short- and longer-term learning success, we constructed a multiple-choice knowledge test applied in a pre-, post-, retention-test design. Parametric tests, such as MANOVA, one-way ANOVA and t-tests were used to identify any differences in gender, teaching approach, number of nets per concept map and their interactions. Results: Type of teaching approach had an effect on concept map structure but not on students' longer-term learning success. Students of the teacher-centred approach produced more net structures than those students who participated in the hands-on instruction. Subsequent analyses showed in total more net structures for female groups. The interaction of gender and number of nets per concept map showed a significant effect on students' longer-term learning success. Conclusion: The study suggests that Kinchin's classification scheme for assessing concept map quality may be a good indicator of students' learning success when applied in combination with a knowledge test.

AB  - Computer-supported collaboration by spatially distributed group members still involves interaction problems within the group. This article presents an empirical study investigating the question of whether computer-supported collaborative problem solving by spatially distributed group members can be fostered by evoking knowledge and information awareness, i.e., awareness of a group member with regard to both their fellow collaborators’ domain knowledge and information underlying this knowledge. The study (N = 30 triads) confirmed the efficiency of this approach by comparing (a) an experimental condition in which an environment for fostering knowledge and information awareness was provided and (b) a control condition without such an environment, with regard to communication and cooperation aspects, the quality of the group maps (needed for solving the problems), and the problem-solving performance.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called “Laboratory Experiments in Science Education” based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers’ conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Developing personalised web-based learning systems has been an important research issue in e-learning because no fixed learning pathway will be appropriate for all learners. However, most current web-based learning platforms with personalised curriculum sequencing tend to emphasise the learner preferences and interests in relation to personalised learning services but fail to consider the difficulty level of course materials, learning order of prior and posterior knowledge and learner abilities while constructing a personalised learning path. As a result, these ignored factors thus easily lead to the generation of poor quality learning paths. Generally, learners could generate cognitive overload or fall into cognitive disorientation owing to inappropriate curriculum sequencing during learning processes, thus, reducing the learning effect. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, ontology technologies enable a linguistic infrastructure to represent conceptual relationships between course materials. Ontology can be served as a structured knowledge representation scheme, capable of assisting the construction of a personalised learning path. This study thus proposes a novel genetic-based curriculum sequencing scheme based on a generated ontology-based concept map, which can be automatically constructed by the pretest results of numerous learners, to plan appropriate learning paths for individual learners. The experimental results indicated that the proposed approach could create high-quality learning paths for individual learners. The proposed approach thus can help learners to learn more effectively and to likely reduce learners' cognitive overloads during learning processes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - One of the goals of the Knowledge Puzzle Project is to automatically generate a domain ontology from plain text documents and use this ontology as the domain model in computer-based education. This paper describes the generation procedure followed by TEXCOMON, the Knowledge Puzzle Ontology Learning Tool, to extract concept maps from texts. It also explains how these concept maps are exported into a domain ontology. Data sources and techniques deployed by TEXCOMON for ontology learning from texts are briefly described herein. Then, the paper focuses on evaluating the generated domain ontology and advocates the use of a three- dimensional evaluation: structural, semantic, and comparative. Based on a set of metrics, structural evaluations consider ontologies as graphs. Semantic evaluations rely on human expert judgment, and finally, comparative evaluations are based on comparisons between the outputs of state-of-the-art tools and those of new tools such as TEXCOMON, using the very same set of documents in order to highlight the improvements of new techniques. Comparative evaluations performed in this study use the same corpus to contrast results from TEXCOMON with those of one of the most advanced tools for ontology generation from text. Results generated by such experiments show that TEXCOMON yields superior performance, especially regarding conceptual relation learning. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - When discussing the topic “Hunger in Africa” with students, incorrect and biased ideas on the causes for hunger are revealed. In order to change the students' personal concepts it is necessary to become acquainted with their mental models. Therefore, a survey of Geography students' different personal theories concerning “Hunger in Africa” was carried out. By means of interviews followed by concept mapping, the various personal theories were identified. It became apparent that the students mostly rely on climate and the population growth as arguments to explain the occurrence of hunger in Africa. The greatest difference between the personal and the scientific theories was that the students included almost no external influences, whether economic or political, in their explanations but relied mostly on factors within a country when formulating their statements. The research literature commonly suggests that there are three steps in reshaping learners' “misconceptions”. The first is to make the present views explicitly the subject of the discussion. At this point the experiences that led to these views should be reflected on and newly interpreted. Second, the newly acquired knowledge must prove itself when used in certain contexts. Finally, during the process, a cooperative culture of learning must prevail, where the learner is convinced that he can control his own acquisition of knowledge. On the basis of these insights, teaching aids were developed that allow students to check their own personal concepts, to dismiss them and to align them with scientific concepts.

It states that the author had first known of the Element Ball research project which she modified from Jeff Hepburn a colleague, during the "Biennial Conference on Chemical Education," from whom she requested for directions. Hepburn learned about the project from Steve Long who was introduced to the idea at a "Conference for the Advancement of Science Teachers" meeting. She relates that she made further improvement of her Element Icosahedron project when she went back to graduate school at Ball State University. She accounts that directions and concept maps of the project for the differentiation of physical and chemical properties are found on the WebQuest.

AB  - This study investigated how well 74 6th-grade science students represented text structures from a 900-word textbook chapter on soil conservation, given a concept map template with four superordinate terms and 24 unsorted concepts. Findings suggest students were more successful at classifying pre-selected terms under given superordinate categories than they were at fully identifying relevant concept sets and articulating three different relationship types between terms. No significant differences were noted in the mapping performance of students at different reading levels. About two-third of students indicated they enjoyed concept mapping and would prefer to both read and map rather than just read without mapping. Students also expressed a strong preference for mapping in pairs or small groups compared to mapping alone. Multiple recommendations are provided for improving the relational thinking of students tasked with concept mapping expository science texts, including bridging to more open-ended maps, embedding mapping in longer-term inquiry projects, and leveraging collaborative and tool-based scaffolds.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that paves the way to represent knowledge schematically. In this research, concept mapping was used as an assessment method on the impulse-momentum topic. The purpose of this study was to determine teacher candidates' knowledge about understanding of the concepts of impulse and momentum by comparing and contrasting two different methods; namely, students' concept maps and an achievement test. The mean of teacher candidates' concept map scores are extremely low when compared with the scores of the achievement test. In addition, it was seen that although a great number of concepts were written down, not many relationships were established between these concepts. There is a weak correlation between the achievement test and the concept map scores since concept maps assess the students' knowledge from a conceptual perspective while the achievement tests measure the level of students' knowledge on the topic and his/her ability to apply this knowledge on different occasions.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. Th e study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkale University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators.

AB  - The article examines an algebra-based physics course for preservice teachers. It analyzes the integration of two pedagogical strategies in the course to connect the gap between inquiry-learning experiences and the teachers' nature of science (NOS) understandings. It notes that teachers encounter the NOS concepts in the course through daily reflective questions and concept mapping without explicit NOS scheme. The author recommends the explicit development of ways for students to connect the inquiry-learning experiences and NOS concepts.

AB  - This research is concerned with preservice teacher understanding of six earth and space science concepts that are often taught in elementary school: the reason for seasons, phases of the moon, why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two sections of a science methods course (N= 52) completed an open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest) demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. Concept mapping had an additive effect in building understanding, as evident on the second posttest. The findings suggest useful strategies for university science instructors to use in clarifying science concepts while modeling activities teachers can use in their own classrooms.

AB  - We address four main areas in which graduate quantum mechanics education can be improved: course content, textbook, teaching methods, and assessment tools. We report on a three year longitudinal study at the Colorado School of Mines using innovations in all these areas. In particular, we have modified the content of the course to reflect progress in the field of quantum mechanics over the last 50 years, used textbooks that include such content, incorporated a variety of teaching techniques based on physics education research, and used a variety of assessment tools to study the effectiveness of these reforms. We present a new assessment tool, the Graduate Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey, and further testing of a previously developed assessment tool, the Quantum Mechanics Conceptual Survey. We find that graduate students respond well to research-based techniques that have been tested mainly in introductory courses, and that they learn much of the new content introduced in each version of the course. We also find that students' ability to answer conceptual questions about graduate quantum mechanics is highly correlated with their ability to solve calculational problems on the same topics. In contrast, we find that students' understanding of basic undergraduate quantum mechanics concepts at the modern physics level is not improved by instruction at the graduate level.

AB  - We present the results of a national study on the teaching and learning of astronomy as taught in general education, non-science-major, introductory astronomy courses. Nearly 4000 students enrolled in 69 sections of courses taught by 36 different instructors at 31 institutions completed (pre- and post-instruction) the Light and Spectroscopy Concept Inventory (LSCI) from Fall 2006 to Fall 2007. The classes varied in size and `were from all types of institutions, including 2- and 4-year colleges and universities. Normalized gain scores for each class were calculated. Pre-instruction LSCI scores were clustered around -25%, independent of class size and institution type, and normalized gain scores varied from about -0.07 to 0.50. To estimate the fraction of classroom time spent on learner-centered, active-engagement instruction we developed and administered an Interactivity Assessment Instrument (IAI). Our results suggest that the differences in gains were due to instruction in the classroom, not the type of class or institution. We also found that higher interactivity classes had the highest gains, confirming that interactive learning strategies are capable of increasing student conceptual understanding. However, the wide range of gain scores seen for both lower and higher interactivity classes suggests that the use of interactive learning strategies is not sufficient by itself to achieve high student gain.

AB  - Simply placing electronic geoscience resources such as datasets, methods, ontologies, workflows and articles in a digital library or cyberinfrastructure does not mean that they will be used successfully by other researchers or educators. It is also necessary to provide the means to locate potentially useful content, and to understand it. Without suitable provision for these needs, many useful resources will go undiscovered, or else will be found but used inappropriately. In this article, we describe an approach to discovering, describing and understanding e-resources based on the notion that meaning is carried in the interconnections between resources and the actors in the cyberinfrastructure (including individuals, groups, organizations), as well as by ontologies and conventional metadata. Navigation around this universe is achieved by implementing the idea of perspectives as dynamic, conceptual views (defined by SPARQL-like queries against an OWL schema) that not only act as filters, but also dynamically promote and demote concepts, relationships and properties according to their immediate relevance. We describe a means to represent a wide variety of interactions between resources using the notion of a knowledge nexus, and we illustrate its use with resources and actors from the Geosciences Network (GEON) cyberinfrastructure community. We also closely link browsing and visualizing strategies to our nexus, drawing on ideas from semiotics to move resources and connections not currently of interest from the foreground to the background, and vice versa, using a new form of adaptive perspective. We illustrate our ideas via ConceptVista, an open-source concept mapping application that provides rich, visual depictions of the resources, cyber-community and myriad connections between them. Examples are presented that show how geoscientific knowledge can be explored not only via ontological structure, but also by use cases, social networks. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - A consensus map of science is generated from an analysis of 20 existing maps of science. These 20 maps occur in three basic forms: hierarchical, centric, and noncentric (or circular). The consensus map, generated from consensus edges that occur in at least half of the input maps, emerges in a circular form. The ordering of areas is as follows: mathematics is (arbitrarily) placed at the top of the circle, and is followed clockwise by physics, physical chemistry, engineering, chemistry, earth sciences, biology, biochemistry, infectious diseases, medicine, health services, brain research, psychology, humanities, social sciences, and computer science. The link between computer science and mathematics completes the circle. If the lowest weighted edges are pruned from this consensus circular map, a hierarchical map stretching from mathematics to social sciences results. The circular map of science is found to have a high level of correspondence with the 20 existing maps, and has a variety of advantages over hierarchical and centric forms. A one-dimensional Riemannian version of the consensus map is also proposed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The researchers investigated the comparative effects of individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. One hundred and sixty one students completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, students were assigned to three groups: a self-selected study strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a collaborative pairs – concept mapping group. Collaboratively and individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept learning as measured on a comprehension test. However, the students who collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding.

AB  - This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map editor) with social education students. Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure. Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use has been studied over the last few years. CM-ED is a multilingual and multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps. Until recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science university degree. This paper represents a qualitative step in the evaluation of CM-ED: from technical students to students of more theoretical fields. The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and the carried out study are presented in this paper. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - Abstract: Specifications of conceptualisations (ontologies) are often employed for representing reality, both in knowledge representation and software engineering. While languages offer sophisticated constructs and rigorous semantics for building conceptual entities, no attention is paid to the relationship between such entities and the world they intend to represent. This paper studies such a relationship and provides empirical evidences in favour of two main hypotheses: (1) conceptualisations are insufficient to fully represent the specifics of reality; (2) languages (both representation and design-oriented) are general representations of (classes of) systems in the world, and they can be characterised as scientific theories. The first hypothesis establishes a problem for which we propose a solution based on the explicit elaboration of statements claiming the similarity (in some respects and to certain degrees of accuracy) between conceptual entities and real-world systems of interest. The second hypothesis constitutes a new perspective for understanding languages, whose advantages to representation and design are discussed in detail. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - A concept map (CM) is a hierarchically arranged, graphic representation of the relationships among concepts. Concept mapping (CMING) is the process of constructing a CM. This paper examines whether a CMING strategy can be useful in helping students to improve their learning performance in a business and economics statistics course. A single factor, between subjects experimental design with three participant groups (collaborative concept mapping (CCMING) versus individual concept mapping (ICMING) versus traditional textbook exercises (TTE)) was employed. The experimental results suggest that adopting a CMING strategy can significantly improve student learning achievement in statistics, compared to using TTE, and adopting a CCMING improves student achievement even more than using ICMING. Furthermore, most of the students were satisfied with using CMING to learn statistics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Even though comprehension of human physiology is crucial in the clinical setting, students frequently learn part of this subject using rote memory and then are unable to transfer knowledge to other contexts or to solve clinical problems. This study evaluated the impact of articulating the concept map strategy with the mediated learning experience on meaningful learning during the cardiovascular module of a medical physiology course at Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga. This research was based on the ideas of David Ausubel (meaningful learning), Joseph Novak (concept maps), and Reuven Feuerstein (mediated learning experience). Students were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (mediated learning experience articulated with concept mapping) or a control group (traditional methodology). The intervention group constructed concept maps related to cardiovascular physiology and used them to solve problems related to this subject. The control group attended traditional discussion sessions and problem-solving sessions. All students were evaluated with two types of exams: problem-solving and multiple-choice exams. The intervention group performed significantly better on the problem-solving exams, but the difference was not significant in the multiple-choice exam. It was concluded that intervention promoted meaningful learning that allowed the students to transfer this knowledge to solve problems. The implemented strategy had a greater impact on the students who came into the study with the lowest cognitive competence, possibly because they were empowered by the intervention.

It differs from summative assessment, which aims to rank students according to their achievements to determine which students pass or fail or to assign grades to students. This article reports on a symposium concerned with evidence for the effectiveness of formative assessment in improving learning. It was presented by the Teaching of Physiology Section of the American Physiological Society at the Experimental Biology Meeting of 2008. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper presents research in Pan-European Public Services (PEPS) and Pan-European E-Government Services (PEGS). We examine different types of semantic interoperability issues that may arise when actors, information and services from different Member States (MS) need to cooperate and/or interoperate during the public service provision process. The semantic conflict types that arise in these cases are identified and classified according to a typology that is based on the combination of a known classification for semantic conflicts and domain specific concepts from the Governance Enterprise Architecture object model. This conceptual modelling describes and organizes the problem space, documents the requirements and can thus provide the basis for engineering solutions to resolve the identified conflicts.

AB  - This paper shows how concept mapping can be used to measure the quality of e-learning. Six volunteers (all of them 3rd-year medical students) took part in a programme of e-learning designed to teach the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The quality of change in individuals' maps was assessed using criteria developed to distinguish between meaningful and rote-learning outcomes. Student maps were also scored for evidence of conceptual richness and understanding. Finally, each map was compared directly with the content of the electronic teaching material. The results show that many of the student misconceptions were put right in the course of their learning but that many of the key concepts introduced in the teaching were ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote) by the students. This was because the teaching material locked these new ideas in structures and terminology that precluded meaning-making among non-experts. Our data suggest that students' prior knowledge is a key determinant of meaningful learning. We suggest that this must be acknowledged if the design and use of electronic teaching material is also to be meaningful. Ultimately, measures of student learning are the only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching through technology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The development of teaching in higher education towards a more learner-orientated model has been supported by the literature on individual learning differences and on learning styles in particular. This has contributed to the evolution of university pedagogy away from a medieval transmission model than runs counter to contemporary understanding of learning. However, rather than solving problems of classroom practice, recognition of student learning differences has amplified a number of tensions within the system that have not been adequately resolved in practical terms for academic staff. Such tensions complicate the professional lives of university teachers and as a consequence may lead to cycles of non-learning as teachers retreat towards the familiar transmission of content. A reconceptualisation of university pedagogy towards an expertise model allows the variation between complementary chains of practice and networks of understanding to be exploited as a positive characteristic of the learning experience.

AB  - Despite its importance as a central goal in environmental education, there appears to be little consensus about how best to document, assess and evaluate understanding of environmental concepts. This illustrative case study describes and demonstrates the use of the concept mapping strategy as an effective tool for assessing environmental understanding. Data were collected from 325 middle school-aged (11-14 years) individuals and comparisons were made among those enrolled in a model, university-based, informal, residential marine education program (viz. MarineQuest) and a matched group of non-participating students. Using a non-randomized Solomon Four Group experimental design, differences in the structural complexity and content validity of knowledge about marine animal life were explored. Results reveal significant differences in the frequencies of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branching and cross-linking and in the frequencies and types of critical concepts depicted. In all cases, where differences were found, they favored participants who enrolled in the environmental education intervention. The findings suggest that concept maps offer a valuable alternative or adjunct to traditional pencil and paper tests and provide both a qualitative and a quantitative measure of conceptual understanding.

AB  - There has recently been significant emphasis placed on environmental education through, for example, the UN's Decade of Education for Sustainable Development. Despite this, there is still considerable debate within the literature as to how the aims of environmental education can be achieved within schools. It seems likely that if there is a lack of agreement as to what education for sustainable development should include, then this will impact students' understanding of sustainable development. This paper presents findings from research investigating how one class of 12- to 13-year-old geography students in the UK understands the concept of sustainability. The research used concept-mapping and semi-structured interviews to explore the students' understandings of sustainability, within a case study framework. The substantive findings of this research suggest that there is a wide variety of understanding of sustainability among the students, but that generally they allude to three: the nature, purpose and timescale of sustainability. The paper also considers the impact of method on researching students' subject understandings, in particular the use of context when considering abstract concepts, such as sustainability, and the different results obtained when conducting interviews versus concept maps.

AB  - We investigated whether and how prior knowledge activation improves learning outcomes for high school (less experienced learners) and university students (experienced learners) in a hypertext environment. Map coherence was defined as the extent to which relationships between the concepts in the map were made explicit. Therefore, we classified the mapping task of creating and labelling lines as low-coherent, and the mapping task of labelling provided lines as high-coherent. Learners were randomly assigned to the conditions of (1) high-coherent knowledge activation; (2) low-coherent knowledge activation; and (3) a baseline condition without prior knowledge activation. We found an overall effect for prior knowledge activation, learning experience, and an interaction between learning experience and the coherence of the prior knowledge activation task on learning outcomes. High school students benefited most from labelling provided lines, while university physics majors benefited most from creating and labelling lines. This interaction effect and effects of the specific mapping tasks on process measures support the claim that different prior knowledge activation tasks are suited for different groups of learners.

AB  - This study was designed to theoretically articulate and empirically assess the role of computer scaffolds. In this project, several examples of educational software were developed to scaffold the learning of students performing high level cognitive activities. The software used in this study, Artemis, focused on scaffolding the learning of students as they performed information seeking activities. As 5th grade students traveled through a project-based science unit on photosynthesis, researchers used a pre-post design to test for both student motivation and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. To measure both variables, a motivation survey and three methods of concept map analysis were used. The student use of the scaffolding features was determined using a database that tracked students’ movement between scaffolding tools. The gain scores of each dependent variable was then correlated to the students’ feature use (time and hits) embedded in the Artemis Interface. This provided the researchers with significant relationships between the scaffolding features represented in the software and student motivation and conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. There were a total of three significant correlations in comparing the scaffolding use by hits (clicked on) with the dependent variables and only one significant correlation when comparing the scaffold use in time. The first significant correlation ( r = .499, p < .05) was between the saving/viewing features hits and the students’ task value. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the saving/viewing features and the students’ perception of how interesting, how important, and how useful the task is. The second significant correlation ( r = 0.553, p < 0.01) was between the searching features hits and the students’ self-efficacy for learning and performance. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the searching features and the students’ perception of their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task. The third significant correlation ( r = 0.519, p < 0.05) was between the collaborative features hits and the students’ essay performance scores. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the collaborative features and the students’ ability to perform high cognitive tasks. Finally, the last significant correlation ( r = 0.576, p < 0.01) was between the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the maintenance features and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis.

AB  - Commercial computer games contain "physics engine" components, responsible for providing realistic interactions among game objects. The question naturally arises of whether these engines can be used to develop educational materials for high school and university physics education. To answer this question, the author's group recently conducted a detailed scientific investigation of the physics engine of Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004). This article presents their motivation, methodology, and results. The author presents the findings of experiments that probed the accessibility and fidelity of UT2004's physics engine, examples of educational materials developed, and an evaluation of their use in high school classes. The associated pedagogical implications of this approach are discussed, and the author suggests guidelines for educators on how to deploy the approach. Key resources are presented on an associated Web site. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio. The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth's atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the 3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time). Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may reduce overall system access time; while higher math proficiency may predict retention scores. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Past practice has assumed a strong correspondence between concept maps and complementary text passages. To quantify and explore this correspondence, this investigation examines the average percent of agreement of multiple concept maps derived from one short text passage. Participants were 16 graduate-level students enrolled in a curriculum course. Participants worked in dyads to convert a 255-word text passage on the heart and circulatory system into a concept map of this content. Propositions in the eight resulting concept maps were analyzed using Pathfinder KNOT software. The correspondence between the eight concept maps and the text passage were only fair to poor. However, for the three dyads with a science major as a member, these concept maps corresponded more with each other (e.g., 61%, 65%, and 87% agreement), and also with the text passage (e.g., 46%, 52%, and 55% agreement). Thus prior knowledge may be critical in concept mapping and likely relates to selecting the most important concepts to include from the universe of concepts and also knowing when the map is completed.

AB  - We previously reported how the opinions of second-year dentistry students and faculty members can be used to construct an assessment rubric to grade group-based concept maps in physiology (14). This article describes the second phase of this study of the subsequent year's cohort. A case study approach was used to investigate how groups of students used the criteria to complete their complex concept maps. Students' opinions about the assessment task and newly constructed rubric were sampled. Opinions across groups were correlated to academic achievements in the course. Two groups of four students volunteered to be videorecorded during a 4-h workshop, during which they completed their maps. The mapping task was not generally favored by students. However, those students who did favor the task achieved higher academic grades. Most students favored the newly constructed assessment rubric, commenting that it was easy to understand, fair, and appropriate, but reported that extra guidance from tutors and other resources were required. Coded videorecordings of the two observation groups revealed complex interactions around the three criteria of content, logic and understanding, and presentation. Two broad patterns of working were identified. One group distributed their efforts more evenly across the criteria, whereas the other group completed their maps by addressing the criteria in stages. These findings clearly indicate the academic challenges and social complexity in how students work in groups to complete complex concept maps in physiology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - A key challenge of effective teaching is assessing and monitoring the extent to which students have assimilated the material they were taught. Concept mapping is a methodology designed to model what students have learned. In effect, it seeks to produce graphical representations (called concept maps) of the concepts that are important to a given domain and how they are related, according to the students. In recent decades various methods have emerged to evaluate concept maps, each measuring different features of concept maps. New approaches are still being developed. Few guidelines are available regarding the method to choose for a given application. This paper is a literature review that consists of two parts. The first is a review of the many automated and manual techniques of concept map analysis. The second is a critical and reflective commentary on these techniques. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, the authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing the inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between the concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Failure to grasp the important concepts of the central dogma (DNA ® mRNA® proteins) often leaves college freshman biology students with a weak foundation in molecular biology. It is hypothesized that the use of stimuli (clay model, concept map, and computer exercise) prior to the genetic engineering experiment introduced in the first college biology course will improve students' understanding of the central dogma. The experiment that the students will perform focuses on the analysis of the phenotype and genotype of E. coli expressing a recombinant DNA molecule containing genes that confer resistance to ampicillin and kanamycin. In order to determine the students' understanding of the central dogma concepts, a study is designed using a Quasi experimental pre/post test design. Subjects (N=67) will be split into four different lab groups and introduced to different instruments (authors designed tests and quizzes) over several weeks prior to and after the genetic engineering experiment is performed in the lab. The four groups will receive the following different stimuli prior to the experiment: Three of the groups will work either with authors' designed hands-on models, authors' designed concepts map, or an interactive computer based tutorial. The fourth group will be given no stimulus (other than "free time"), and is designated as the control. The MANOVA and Bonferroni Post Hoc tests will be used to analyze obtained data and to assess whether any of the groups receiving the stimulation based tools show an improved comprehension of the central dogma of molecular biology as compared to the control "free time" group. Significance will be determined at p<0.05. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers' beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many class- room teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in .science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers' thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers' beliefs stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool may have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers' stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards' vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could he characterized in three ways: coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs' are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs' about the connections of concepts within science.

AB  - To explore the ways in which teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches influence students' conceptual understanding of seasonal change, we designed a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) course to compare, by means of concept maps, the learning outcome of students in two groups: a teacher-guided (TG) class (with whole-class presentations) and a student-centered (SC) class (with individual online learning). The participants were two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this technologically enhanced environment, the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F = 28.05, p < 0.001). The conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change. The student-centered approach allows students to more freely test their own hypotheses in the processes of exploration and modeling, and thus move from assimilatory to properly scientific explanations. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Abstract: Concept maps have been widely put to educational uses. They possess a number of appealing features which make them a promising tool for teaching, learning, evaluation, and curriculum planning. This paper presents self-associated concept mapping (SACM) which extends the use of concept mapping by proposing the idea of self-construction and automatic problem solving to traditional concept maps. The SACM can be automatically constructed and dynamic updated. A Constrained Fuzzy Spreading Activation (CFSA) model is proposed to SACM for supporting rapid and automatic decisions. With the successful development of the SACM, the capability of Knowledge-based systems (KBS) can be enhanced. The concept and operational feasibility of the SACM is realized through a case study in a consultancy business. The theoretical results are found to agree well with the experimental results.

AB  - Abstract: This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the ‘paper & pencil’ concept mapping technique and the computer-supported educational environment ‘ModelsCreator’. Students’ shared activity in both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and also identify the activity’s similar and different aspects in each one. Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of which concerns the process of collaboratively creating a plant growth model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the students’ conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process has been derived within the theoretical framework of ‘activity theory’ on the basis of the OCAF scheme for basic modeling operations and the scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (1998). Secondary students’ dynamic modeling processes: analyzing, reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 7(3), 215–234.] for higher-order modeling actions. According to our results, four major modeling actions (analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of modeling operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students’ conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed.

AB  - Bioinfomiatics research requires input from several different domains, but the majority of bioinformatics learners are unfamiliar with specific biological issues. We propose an approach that combines problem-based learning and concept map methodology to realize and construct the biological problems. As part of the problem-solving process, learners must gather materials and identify essential knowledge-thus creating a scenario conducive to learner training. We believe this approach will be of great use to non-biologist learners in the bioinformatics field. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The author presents his thoughts on his development of concept maps for the teaching of general chemistry. He said that he has taught this course many times. Relative to this, the belief that students often see this course as a collection of isolated topics prompted him to develop these concept maps to ensure efficient teaching. These were developed in Powerpoint as organization charts and were converted to pdf files which were made available to students as material on the course.

AB  - Curriculum design is a concern in European Universities as they face the forthcoming European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This process can be eased by the use of scientific tools such as Concept-Mapping Techniques (CMT) that extract and organize the most relevant information from experts’ experience using statistics techniques, and helps a working group to achieve conclusions. This paper presents an empirical exploratory research study related to the application of the CMT to the design of the Electronic Engineering (EE) Degree at the University of Seville, Spain. Considering the Career-space conclusions as the initial point, the main relevant competences were identified in a brainstorming technique. These competences are organized according to their affinity using CMT, establishing and interpreting the main clusters and their relative importance. Finally, a reliability analysis of the concept maps was carried out verifying the correctness of the procedure and validating the results for the curricula adaptation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who independently used their study time. The findings revealed that individually generating concept maps on computers during study time positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept maps on computers for learning.

AB  - Pupils with autism often present significant challenges to teachers. They seem to have real strengths in visual processing but a cognitive style that encourages them to focus on detail rather than the overarching connections between concepts. Veronica Roberts, currently undertaking doctoral training at the Institute of Education, University of London, in order to become an educational psychologist, and Richard Joiner, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, set out to explore these issues. In this article, they report the outcomes of a naturalistic experiment in which they investigated the utility of concept mapping as an educational strategy with pupils diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Theoretical arguments supporting the use of concept mapping with an autistic population are outlined in the paper. A tutor group of ten pupils with ASD, aged between 11 and 14 years, took part in the study. Concept mapping tasks were integrated within National Curriculum science lessons in collaboration with the school's science teacher. The study found that the increase in pupil performance in subject-specific questionnaires was nearly four times greater in the concept mapping condition than after a more conventional teaching intervention. Veronica Roberts and Richard Joiner tentatively draw out the implications of their work for staff who work with pupils with ASD and make recommendations for further research into the use of these learning strategies.

AB  - In spite of the common belief that Chinese natural philosophy and medicine have a unique frame of reference completely foreign to the West, this article argues that they in fact have significant cognitive and epistemic similarities with certain esoteric health beliefs of pre-Christian Europe. From the standpoint of Cognitive Science, Chinese Medicine appears as a proto-scientific system of health observances and practices based on a symptomological classification of disease using two elementary dynamical-processes pattern categorization schemas: a hierarchical and combinatorial inhibiting-activating model (Yin-Yang), and a non-hierarchical and associative five-parameter semantic network (5-Elements/Agents). The concept-map of the five-parameter model amounts to a pentagram, a commonly found geomantic and spell casting sigil in a number of pre-Christian health and safety beliefs in Europe, to include the Pythagorean cult of Hygieia, and the Old Religion of Northern Europe. This non-hierarchical pattern-recognition archetype/ prototype was hypothetically added to the pre-existing hierarchical one to form a hybrid nosology that can accommodate for a change in disease perceptions. The selection of five parameters rather than another number might be due to a numerological association between the integer five, the golden ratio, the geometry of the pentagram and the belief in health and wholeness arising from cosmic or divine harmony. In any case, this body of purely empirical knowledge is nowadays widely flourishing in the US and in Europe as an alternative to Western Medicine and with the claim of being a unique, independent and comprehensive medical system, when in reality it is structurally--and perhaps historically--related to the health and safety beliefs of pre-Christian Europe; and without the prospect for an epistemological rupture, it will remain built upon rudimentary cognitive modalities, ancient metaphysics, and a symptomological view of disease.

AB  - The article discusses the concept-mapping approach of William Trochim that stresses the significance of educational program and curriculum management toward faculty consensus. This structured group approach is used in arriving at a consensus on learning goals and objectives. It is a mixed-method technique that changes qualitative perceptions of similarity and value into statistical and optical representations of the conceptual domain and is used in public policy research. The authors note that concept-mapping approach assists academic administrators in handling the restructuring of curriculum and the improvement of faculty consensus.

AB  - Abstract: In information systems that support knowledge-discovery applications such as scientific exploration, reliance on highly structured ontologies as data-organization aids can be limiting. With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication—or worse, left unrecorded altogether—for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, allowing end users to evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use concept maps as an ‘expressed model’ to investigate students' mental models regarding the homeostasis of blood sugar. The difficulties in learning the concept of homeostasis and in probing mental models have been revealed in many studies. Homeostasis of blood sugar is one of the themes in junior high school biology in Taiwan. However, few studies have investigated it. Here, semi-structured interviews were conducted together with concept mapping to explore students' mental models. There were 14 students, 7th- and 9th-graders, in this study. From the results, both groups were shown to lack a concept of the nervous system. However, 7th-graders did have more developed concepts of the endocrine and digestive systems. The data also indicated that students used external behaviours or life experiences to explain the mechanism responsible for the homeostasis of blood sugar, but did not possess a detailed view of the components of the mechanism. The implications, and recommendations for pedagogy, are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This research examines the dimensions underlying reality-based TV programs as a first step towards uncovering the reality programming subgroups that might exist in viewers' minds and the themes that might distinguish them. Two samples—one of students and one of city residents—engaged in a sorting task of 33 reality-based programs. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) indicated two underlying dimensions along which audiences think about reality TV (romance and competitiveness), which were supported by subsequent analyses. These findings both help frame future theoretically driven research on reality-based programming and offer insight into how research interested in the effects of programming themes might proceed.

AB  - Change and complexity are creating a need for increasing levels of literacy in science and technology. Presently, we are beginning to provide students with clear contexts in which to learn, including clearly written text, visual displays and maps, and more effective instruction. We are also beginning to give students tools that promote their own literacy by helping them to interact with the learning context. These tools include peer-group skills as well as strategies to analyze text and to indicate comprehension by way of text summaries and concept maps. Even with these tools, more appears to be needed. Disparate backgrounds and languages interfere with the comprehension and the sharing of knowledge. To meet this need, two new tools are proposed. The first tool fractures language ontologically, giving all learners who use it a language to talk about what has, and what has not, been uttered in text or talk about the world. The second fractures language epistemologically, giving those involved in working with text or on the world around them a way to talk about what they have done and what remains to be done. Together, these tools operate as a two- tiered knowledge representation of knowledge. This representation promotes both an individual meta-cognitive and a social meta-cognitive approach to what is known and to what is not known, both ontologically and epistemologically. Two hypotheses guide the presentation: If the tools are taught during early childhood, children will be prepared to master science and technology content. If the tools are used by both students and those who design and deliver instruction, the learning of such content will be accelerated. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this 4-year research study was to develop paper-and-pencil tests that could be administered to a wide range of students in order to establish a database about students' physics conceptions from elementary school to high school levels in Taiwan. The students' misconceptions of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, heat, sound and wave, and optics were diagnosed. In the beginning of this study, we extensively reviewed the research literature on related conceptions. With the use of concept maps and related propositional statements, we also interviewed some students to find out their conceptual understanding of the selected key concepts. These data provided sufficient information about students' thoughts of several concepts. Through a process of developing two-tier test items, nine versions of physics questionnaires were obtained. More than 13,000 students were randomly sampled in a national survey. After data analysis, the results indicated that students' misconceptions in physics such as the image formed by lenses and mirrors and the torque and rotational motion were consistent with their ages. However, in some cases, such as the current in an electric circuit, students' understandings of concepts did not improve with age. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Literature on science conceptions research and field investigations was used to probe alternative conceptions of primary school pupils. Theoretical studies from the literature have shown that there are many emphases on the physical meaning and the effects drawn by philosophers of science leading to the formation of new paradigms concerning science conceptions research. Our focus on primary school pupils' alternative conceptions pertaining to batteries (ACCB), in six phases, was to (1) analyse the context regarding batteries present in primary school; (2) summarize propositional statements and develop a target concept map on batteries; (3) edit protocols for interviews; (4) collect and analyse pupils' ACCB; (5) use the results from phases (1)-(4) to construct a two-tier diagnostic instrument; and (6) submit our instrument with others to carry out tests in a National Science Concept Learning Study (NSCLS). Interview results from 21 primary school pupils show that the characteristics of their ACCB can be categorized into several conceptual models related to language, learning processes, and public media. From the NSCLS, two-tier test data depict the ACCB of the primary school pupils in Taiwan. Many alternative conceptions are significantly related to language and daily life in Taiwan. ACCB in this research can be categorized as either content free or content specific. Conception models based on content free and content specific are presented according to the properties of the ACCB. Our joint venture on concept formation research has been affected by the four temporal paradigms formed at certain prominent historical landmarks in science conceptions research. Our data also show a degree of general similarity with existing literature on science conceptions research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper reports on a study of ecology teaching and learning in a Swedish primary school class (age 10-11yrs). A teaching sequence was designed to help students read nature in a river ecosystem. The teaching sequence had a 'bottom up' approach, taking as its starting point a common key organism - the freshwater shrimp. From this species and its ecology, the perspective was broadened to involve studies of the interrelations between organisms and finally to the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors. A large part of the instruction took place outdoors. Students were interviewed three times during the course when they were presented with a tray full of objects (both biotic and abiotic) from the ecosystem. The students' task was to name and describe the objects and then to link them up in as many relevant ways as possible, explaining the reasons for the links. The interviews have been transcribed onto concept maps and SOLO-taxonomy was used to illustrate their developing ecological understanding. Results indicate how students related several abstract processes and correlations back to the key organism studied early in the teaching sequence. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The derivative is not only an important subject for mathematics but also is an important subject for engineering, physics, economy, chemistry, and statistics. Especially, mathematics depends on strongly preceding learning and the subject of derivative will be used in university education by all students. Therefore, it is one of the most important subjects. This study's purpose is to explore student mistakes and errors in derivative and determine the areas in which students have probable misconceptions. For this purpose, 7 questions were chosen from "the Student Placement Test" (OSS). These questions were transferred into open-ended questions. The results of the study took place at sixth form college are described and discussed. The test administered to 53 students from Balikesir Fatma Emin Kutvar Anatolian High School in the fall-term of 2005-2006. Determining the possible misconceptions should help teachers when they teach this subject. The study findings showed that students could not understand derivative definition that depends on limit, make mistakes in composite functions and trigonometric functions, and establish wrong relations between tangent's slope, and normal's slope. Teachers need to be able to find errors and misconceptions in students' solutions. Teachers also need to be applying meaningful learning strategies such as concept maps, worksheets about derivative (e.g. Appendix B, Appendix C). [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20 multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test. The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Students bring prior knowledge to their learning experiences. This prior knowledge is known to affect how students encode and later retrieve new information learned. Teachers and content developers can use information about students' prior knowledge to create more effective lessons and materials. In many content areas, particularly the sciences, there is extensive research about the conceptions and misconceptions students bring to the learning environment. This research has used tools ranging from instructor and student interviews to written assessments to identify these ideas. In addition, concept maps have been explored as a way to understand how students relate different concepts to each other. A difficulty with concept maps is that there are not good solutions for studying larger groups of students, but also maintaining the detail to see how specific concepts are related. One way to address this is with similarity ratings and the use of the Pathfinder network program. Although there are some areas in which a large amount is known about students' knowledge, there is little understanding of either student or instructor knowledge in the field of computer networking. This paper is a preliminary attempt to explore the knowledge structures of students entering a computer networking class and their instructors using the Pathfinder network methodology. The study participants consisted of 156 students and 12 teachers in 12 different classes, each at a different institution. All of the students were enrolled in the first course (Cisco Certified Networking Associate 1) in the Cisco Networking Academy Program. Students and instructors rated the similarity between pairs of words that represented concepts covered in the course prior to beginning instruction in the course. There were two different groups of words, one representing the course as a whole and one representing a specific chapter. The similarity ratings for these terms were submitted to Pathfinder network analysis, creating both average concept maps for students and instructors as well as measures of the similarity between the maps. Analysis of the maps revealed an instructor map that corresponded to the OSI model, a model of networking. The corresponding student map indicated students did not have this conceptualization of how the theoretical layers of the model work. Instead, students tended to link things that might generalize as equipment, and words that sounded similar. This linking of equipment was further demonstrated in the analysis of concepts from the chapter that introduces basic networking concepts. Whereas instructors exhibited an organization by network type (local or wide-area), the students displayed an equipment-centric organization. The instructor networks provide initial information about how experts organize knowledge in this relatively young field. By understanding some of the ways that students understand concepts prior to instruction, teachers should be better able to focus and tailor instruction. [ABSTRACT FROM PUBLISHER]

AB  - Problem-based learning (PBL) is now an established method in undergraduate medical education that aims to develop reasoning skills based on clinical problems. More recently, the use of concept mapping in medical education aims to improve meaningful learning. At the New University of Lisbon, we have been using PBL as a major educational method in a pathophysiology course. In 2003–2004, we started to use Inspiration, a computer-based concept mapping tool, with a single tutorial PBL group. A total of 36 maps were constructed related to short cases, already used in the PBL course, in which a certain number of key nodes were hidden to allow the students to fill in the gaps. The results obtained appear to indicate that the use of concept maps stimulated meaningful learning within a PBL course. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Nowadays the European Universities are worried about how to adapt higher education to the new European Higher Education Area, as proposed in the Bologna Magna Charta Universitatum of 1998, and signed by 32 European Education Ministers. One of the key points in this higher education reform was the introduction of new Master’s level curricula. These Masters will look for the professional specialization and they will have to be adapted to the specific skills demanded by the society. This paper presents the results from a cooperation project – funded by the AECI (International Cooperation Spanish Agency) and developed between the University of Seville (Spain) and the Catholic University of Asuncion (Paraguay) – by about the planning of a new master’s level curriculum in digital signal processing (DSP) area, taking into account the Bologna principles and the conclusions obtained by the Career Space Consortium. A scientific method from social science, known as concept mapping techniques, was used to perform this planning. Basically, the idea of concept mapping consists of compiling the opinion from actors belonging to different environments (lecturers, researchers, workers, businessmen, etc.) related to DSP applications. The compiled data were statistically computed to cluster the opinions of the different agents. The result will be a master’s level curricula adapted to the environment requirements and the social settings. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This investigation seeks to confirm a computer-based approach that can be used to score concept maps (Poindexter & Clariana, 2004) and then describes the concurrent criterion-related validity of these scores. Participants enrolled in two graduate courses (n=24) were asked to read about and research online the structure and function of the heart and circulatory system, to construct a concept map, and then to write a 250-word essay on this topic. Pathfinder and Latent Semantic Analysis approaches were used to analyze the data. Term agreement with an expert was significantly related to human-rater concept map scores (r 0.75). All of the computer-derived scores were significantly correlated to human-rater essay scores (maximum r = 0.83). These results indicate that automatically derived concept map scores can provide a relatively low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' science content knowledge.

AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which students learned by constructing, modifying, or viewing node-link diagrams. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.

AB  - Contemporary assessment practices in science education have undergone significant changes in recent decades. The basis for these changes and the resulting new assessment practices are the subject of this two-part paper. Part 1 considers the basis of assessment that, more than 25 years ago, was driven by the assumptions of decomposability and decontextualization of knowledge, resulting in a low-inference testing system, often described as “traditional.” This assessment model was replaced not on account of direct criticism, but rather on account of a larger revolution—the change from behavioral to cognitive psychology, developments in the philosophy of science, and the rise of constructivism. Most notably, the study of the active cognitive processes of the individual resulted in a major emphasis on context in learning and assessment. These changes gave rise to the development of various contextual assessment methodologies in science education, for example, concept mapping assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment. In Part 2, the literature relating to the assessment methods identified in Part 1 is reviewed, revealing that there is not much research that supports their validity and reliability. However, encouraging new work on selected-response tests is forming the basis for reconsideration of past criticisms of this technique. Despite the major developments in contextual assessment methodologies in science education, two important questions remain unanswered, namely, whether grades can be considered as genuine numeric quantities and whether the individual student is the appropriate unit of assessment in public accountability. Given these issues and the requirement for science assessment to satisfy the goals of the individual, the classroom, and the society, tentative recommendations are put forward addressing these parallel needs in the assessment of science learning. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The article describes the various computer technologies introduced into an undergraduate physics course at Acadia University in Nova Scotia. The research focus is whether better teaching and learning models can be accessed by critically analyzing the impact of technology tools both quantitatively and qualitatively. Concept maps are hierarchical maps that place the most inclusive or general topic at the top and the most specific concepts at the bottom. They are useful in tracking students' developmental understanding in science. Students were unanimous in suggesting that the supplemental Internet resources were worthwhile because the resources presented audio and visual accounts of sophisticated vibration and sounds.

AB  - Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student-generated visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle school science concept learning. In a post-test-only-control-group design, scores were compared among a control-group (n=28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper (n=30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers (n=34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post-test than the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group's scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups indicating that visualization might interact with learner characteristics. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Pre-prepared concept maps that organise knowledge in a non-linear fashion appeal to a variety of cognitive learning styles and may thus represent an educational tool that supports ‘teaching to all types’. However, another central cognitive factor, learning approach, may have a bearing on student take-up of this learning resource. Student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were therefore examined in relation to the principal learning orientations according to Duff's 30-item revised approaches to study inventory (RASI). Approximately one half of students (49.6&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.5%) reported pre-prepared concept maps to be useful to their learning ( n &ThickSpace;=&ThickSpace;121). When preferred learning approach was examined, derived from the highest RASI score per individual and excluding ties, 31.9&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.3%, 29.3&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.2% and 38.8&ThickSpace;±&ThickSpace;4.5% of students demonstrated a preference for the deep approach (DA), strategic approach (STA) and surface approach (SUA), respectively ( P &ThickSpace;>&ThickSpace;0.05, χ 2 goodness-of-fit test, n &ThickSpace;=&ThickSpace;116). There was a weak but statistically significant association between preferred learning approach identified by Duff's 30-item RASI and the self-reported usefulness of concept maps ( P &ThickSpace; [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Faculty efforts to measure outcomes in study abroad programs typically fall short of current expectations for measurable results and increased competencies. Part of the problem stems from the dual challenge of conducting rigorous, objective assessment of these programs without losing the rich, subjective meaning of the cultural experience for student growth and development. The concept mapping method developed by Trochim is a potentially powerful tool for overcoming this challenge, allowing evaluators to utilize qualitative and quantitative research designs simultaneously. This paper illustrates the use of the method in an American social work study abroad program based in Mexico. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Constructing quality assessment rubrics can be challenging, especially when they are used for integrated, group-centered, applied learning. We describe a collaborative assessment task in which groups of second-year dentistry students developed a complex concept map. In groups of four, the students were given a written, simulated, medical history of a patient and required to construct a concept map illustrating relevant pathophysiological concepts and pharmacological interventions. This report describes a research project aimed at making educational goals of the task more explicit through investigating student and faculty member understandings of the criteria that might be used to assess the concept map. Information was gathered about the perceptions of students in relation to the learning goals associated with the task. These were compared with faculty member perceptions. The findings were used to develop an assessment rubric intended to be more accessible to learners. The new rubric used the language of both faculty members and students to more clearly represent expectations of each criterion and standard. This assessment rubric will be used in 2005 for the next phase of the project. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The article discusses the importance of publishing a scientific paper. According to the author the purpose of a scientific paper is to convey ideas to the readers who may be differentiated into experts and novices. Concept mapping is a graphical tool that can be used to summarize complex ideas. Its value lies in the way in which the links between ideas are depicted explicitly to show the writer's beliefs and assumptions about the nature of knowledge integration in a particular context. For the text of a scientific paper to encourage meaningful learning by the student/reader, it must enable the student/reader to link the ideas presented with existing knowledge frameworks and support the construction of understanding. Increasing accessibility to published work is not about compromising quality or dumbing down, it is about increasing clarity and respecting the needs of the readership. Consideration of the readers when writing a paper may increase its readability and increase the likelihood of the paper being used at university as a tool to help students to engage in the discourse of the discipline.

AB  - The main goal of this study is to develop a scientific method for designing a teaching methodology used in a basic digital signal processing (DSP) course. The proposed method is based on concept-mapping techniques, which applies multivariate statistic analysis to summarize the experience and knowledge of teachers involved in basic DSP teaching. As a result, a set of teaching methodologies is obtained. This result, as well as other information obtained related to the relative importance of the concepts to be covered, has been used to program the course. Moreover, different teaching tools have been developed to implement the proposed teaching methodology. Finally, the reliability of the method has been compared with similar studies to validate the proposed methodology. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Aim. The aim of this paper is to stimulate interest in the practical classroom application of concept mapping strategies as an approach that teachers can easily use to enhance collaborative learning. Background. Concept mapping has been developed as a tool to support meaningful learning. However, much of the research literature fails to explain how concept maps might be most gainfully employed within the classroom. As a result, concept mapping is a tool that is under-used. Methods. Students on a postgraduate teacher preparation programme for nurses were arranged in triads on the basis of the morphology of individually-produced concept maps for the topics of 'genetics' and 'pathogenic microbes'. They were arranged in heterogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'pathogenic microbes', and then in homogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'genetics'. The number of acceptable propositions found in their individual maps was compared with the number found in the consensus group maps, and gain scores were calculated for each participant. Findings. Participants arranged in triads of individuals having very different knowledge structures were found to make a greater improvement than those arranged in triads composed of individuals with qualitatively similar knowledge structures. Conclusions. The study was undertaken with a very small sample and only looked at two topic areas. However, the findings support the idea that collaborative groups work most effectively when individuals within the group bring different perspectives to a problem, and that this perspective can be usefully identified within the classroom environment as variations in concept map morphology.

After learning how lake water levels will likely decline, they listen to a story about a grandparent revisiting the lakeshore with a grandchild. In the role of the grandparent and then of the child, they visualize the changed shore and write their impressions of the science and the impact on society. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - In a classroom, a teacher attempts to convey his or her knowledge to the students, and thus it is important for the teacher to obtain formative feedback about how well students are understanding the new material. By gaining insight into the students'' understanding and possible misconceptions, the teacher will be able to adjust the teaching and to supply more useful learning materials as necessary. Therefore, the diagnosis of formative student evaluations is critical for teachers and learners, as is the diagnosis of patterns in the overall learning by a class in order to inform a teacher about the efficacy of his or her teaching. This paper investigates what might be called the “class learning diagnosis problem” by embedding important concepts in a test and analyzing the results with a hierarchical coding scheme. Based on previous research, the part-of and type-of relationships among concepts are used to construct a concept hierarchy that may then be coded hierarchically. All concepts embedded in the test items then can be formulated into concept matrices, and the answer sheets of the learners in a class are then analyzed to indicate particular types of concept errors. The trajectories of concept errors are studied to identify both individual misconceptions students might have as well as patterns of misunderstanding in the overall class. In particular, a clustering algorithm is employed to distinguish student groups who might share similar misconceptions. These approaches are implemented as an integrated module in a previously developed system and applied to two real classroom data sets, the results of which show the practicability of this proposed method.

AB  - Concept browsing interfaces can help educators and learners to locate and use learning resources that are aligned with recognized learning goals. The Strand Map Service enables users to navigate interactive visualizations of related learning goals and to request digital library resources aligned with learning goals. These interfaces are created using a programmatic Web service interface that dynamically generates interactive visual components. Preliminary findings suggest that these library interfaces appear to help users stay focused on the scientific content of their information discovery task, as opposed to focusing on the mechanics of searching.

AB  - The ability to use the research literature within a given field is a basic skill that students should acquire as part of their higher education studies. However, undergraduates need support in developing this skill. The use of concept maps as an aid to interrogating the literature is described here. This may help students to highlight key issues raised within a research paper, and may be used to demonstrate understanding to their tutors. An example is given by reference to the paper in which James Watson and Francis Crick suggest a structure for DNA. In this, annotated concept maps are used to highlight key issues from the paper from two perspectives: the race to describe the structure of DNA, and the biochemistry of the molecule.

AB  - Abstract: The solution of complex, unstructured problems is faced with policy controversy and dispute, unused and misused knowledge, project delay and failure, and decline of public trust in governmental decisions. Mental model mapping (also called concept mapping) is a technique to analyse these difficulties on a fundamental cognitive level, which can reveal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, knowledge and subjective beliefs of stakeholders, experts and other actors, and can stimulate communication and learning. This article presents the theoretical framework from which the use of mental model mapping techniques to analyse this type of problems emerges as a promising technique. The framework consists of the problem solving or policy design cycle, the knowledge production or modelling cycle, and the (computer) model as interface between the cycles. Literature attributes difficulties in the decision-making process to communication gaps between decision makers, stakeholders and scientists, and to the construction of knowledge within different paradigm groups that leads to different interpretation of the problem situation. Analysis of the decision-making process literature indicates that choices, which are made in all steps of the problem solving cycle, are based on an individual decision maker’s frame of perception. This frame, in turn, depends on the mental model residing in the mind of the individual. Thus we identify three levels of awareness on which the decision process can be analysed. This research focuses on the third level. Mental models can be elicited using mapping techniques. In this way, analysing an individual’s mental model can shed light on decision-making problems. The steps of the knowledge production cycle are, in the same manner, ultimately driven by the mental models of the scientist in a specific discipline. Remnants of this mental model can be found in the resulting computer model. The characteristics of unstructured problems (complexity, uncertainty and disagreement) can be positioned in the framework, as can the communities of knowledge construction and valuation involved in the solution of these problems (core science, applied science, and professional consultancy, and “post-normal” science). Mental model maps, this research hypothesises, are suitable to analyse the above aspects of the problem. This hypothesis is tested for the case of the Zwolle storm surch barrier. Analysis can aid integration between disciplines, participation of public stakeholders, and can stimulate learning processes. Mental model mapping is recommended to visualise the use of knowledge, to analyse difficulties in problem solving process, and to aid information transfer and communication. Mental model mapping help scientists to shape their new, post-normal responsibilities in a manner that complies with integrity when dealing with unstructured problems in complex, multifunctional systems.

AB  - Concept mapping activities were trialed over a 2 year period as part of an undergraduate microbiology course. This paper describes this developmental process and offers insight into the most beneficial ways of employing this tool in a higher education setting. The aim was to investigate the use of mapping activities to improve students' integration of the material presented and as a method of course evaluation. It was found that the emphasis placed on concepts at the beginning of the course had a profound influence on the trajectory of conceptual development exhibited by students. Once established, initial conceptual structures seemed resistant to change and restricted the subsequent choice of superordinate concepts. The approach was modified in the second year. Students were encouraged to restructure their understanding by producing a concept map as part of a collaborative group. The concept labels were prescribed and excluded the terminology that had appeared to constrain conceptual development in the previous year. Findings suggest that in order to optimize concept mapping activities they should: (1) reflect a student-centred teaching philosophy; (2) be collaborative; (3) be given sufficient time for reflection and development; (4) avoid using specific terms that restrict conceptual development by hindering appropriate switching between opposing conceptual frameworks. Linking the mapping activity to course grades provided an extrinsic motivation for active engagement in the task. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This experimental study explores how 60 primary-age children's (9-11 years old) understanding of rocks was effected by instruction that used the conceptual structure of the rock cycle together with the analogy of aluminium can recycling. Using a combination of probes into children's understanding, including concept maps and semi-structured interviews, changes to the content of their knowledge (description and classification of rocks) as categorized by membership of particular hierarchical explanatory frameworks (constructed from children's pre-intervention responses), and how such knowledge appears be organized into possible networks of information, are described. Results are then discussed in terms of the impact of the rock cycle, with or without the use of the analogy, on children's existing conceptions, followed by observations on the positive role of the analogy in supporting understanding. In conclusion, the implications for the nature of cognitive change in this domain as revealed by children's explanatory frameworks and the potential value of the aluminium can analogy in supporting children's understanding are addressed.

AB  - Art and design creative techniques are increasingly used in educational and social sciences research as means to complement narrative qualitative research methodologies. Less known is the means by which art and design students may use collage, concept mapping or other artful visual tools to understand narrative in qualitative research. This article aims to demonstrate how artful methods can be combined with more traditional qualitative methodologies to uncover meaning in research texts during data analysis. The authors aim to show how both the phenomenon used and the method applied to data analysis offers a creative way to allow for meaning to emerge, while situating the research firmly in a phenomenological perspective of lived experience of the researcher through a collaborative conversation.

AB  - This study examined the effects of three concept mapping strategies in facilitating achievement of different types of educational objectives. The three concept mapping strategies were concept identifying, proposition identifying and student generated concept mapping. The instructional material was a 2000-word expository text related to the physiology and functioning of the human heart. Instruction was presented in a web based environment. Achievement was measured by three individual and a total criterion test. 105 college levels students were randomly assigned to one of four instructional treatments. Criterion tests were administered immediately after students interacted with their respective treatments. One-way analysis of variance indicated that (a.) specific concept mapping strategies can significantly improve student achievement of specific types of educational objectives and (b) all types of concept mapping strategies are not equally effective in facilitating student achievement.

AB  - Aims. This paper reports a study examining the effects of adopting concept mapping in problem-based learning scenario discussions on the improvement of students' learning outcomes in a nursing course.Background. Students in Taiwan usually have a high degree of anxiety about whether or not they have learned enough. Problem-based learning is a method of teaching that uses a patient situation or scenario to stimulate students to acquire and apply information to solve problems. Concept mapping can promote problem-solving and critical thinking to help students organize complex patient data, process complex relationships and offer holistic care to patients.Methods. An experimental design was used, with participants randomly assigned either to a control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in six problem-based learning scenario discussions during the 16-week semester, while the control group attended a traditional course.Results. The experimental group had significantly higher proposition and hierarchy scores for their concept maps compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in the cross-link and example scores between the two groups. In general, the total score difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance levels. Only one student in the experimental group obtained a high score; most participants in both groups (over 50%) obtained low scores.Conclusions. Concept mapping strategies may be useful for analysis of individual student's thinking processes for (1) emphasizing key concepts or main ideas, (2) understanding relationships between different concepts, including cause-effect and part-whole relationships, (3) reviewing propositions, hierarchies and cross-links in a logically scientific way, and (4) revising concept structures to agree with theory and experience.

AB  - Abstract: A computational framework has been developed for the construction and evaluation of metabolic pathways given input substrates and knowledge of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Application of the framework creates new and existing routes to both chemicals known to exist in biological systems and chemicals novel to biological systems. In the present application, we focus on biosynthetic routes to 7-carboxyindole, a specialty chemical currently produced by organic synthesis, using chorismate as a starting compound and the enzyme actions native to the biosynthetic route from chorismate to tryptophyan. Graph theory and its associated algorithms are exploited to represent molecules and perform enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Through repetitive application of the set of operators representing the enzymatic reactions of interest to the reactants and their progeny, reaction pathways are generated automatically. The concept of generalized enzyme function is introduced and defined as the third-level enzyme function (EC i.j.k) according to the four-digit transformations of the enzyme classification system (EC i.j.k.l). This concept maps enzyme-catalyzed reactions to transformations of functional groups and enables the generation of novel species and pathways. Thermodynamic properties are calculated using a group contribution method “on-the-fly” in order to provide one assessment of the relative feasibility of the novel pathways. [Copyright &y& Elsevier]

AB  - This article presents an interview with the teacher Joseph D. Novak. Novak's career in teaching has spanned over four decades, he is now professor emeritus of Education and Biology at Cornell University, visiting senior scientist at the University of West Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, and president of Joseph D. Novak Knowledge Consultants Inc. Answering a question, he said that, as a young child, he somehow developed the belief that the world could be a better place, and wanted to find a way to help achieve this. He thought he might become an inventor, since he was always tinkering with things. He enjoyed his university teaching in the sciences, and although frustrated with much of the coursework in education, he persisted in his goals of trying to find better ways to educate people.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to describe the challenges of parents of children with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD). Nineteen birth, foster or adoptive parents were asked to answer the following question: "What are the challenges you face parenting a child with a fetal alcohol spectrum disorder?" The data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. Eight clusters resulted. Parents reported the challenges of preventing setbacks in their children's behavior, making time for themselves, making and keeping immediate and longer-term plans with their child, collaborating with the school, keeping the child involved in social activities, keeping their family involved in social activities, being heard by professionals, and managing their child's behavior problems. The themes were consistent with the literature on parenting children with a FASD, with the exception that participants in the study indicated that they found a lack of respect from professionals with whom they came into contact, challenging.

AB  - The search for authentic science research tools to evaluate student understanding in a hybrid learning environment with a large multimedia component has resulted in the use of concept maps as a representation of student's knowledge organization. One hundred and seventy third-semester introductory university-level engineering students represented their understanding related to the atom in a concept map. A qualitative analysis of the data presented a more informative and complete picture of students' understanding as compared with most prominent scoring techniques in the literature. The detailed analysis method is illustrated by means of some students' concept maps and the overall results of the entire student population are discussed. The most striking difference between common and more insightful maps is the inclusion of additional clusters describing models of the atom, beyond the clusters that just describe the elements of atoms (e.g. protons, electrons, etc.) and their characteristics.

AB  - Concept maps that integrate and relate concepts in a nonlinear fashion are widely accepted as an educational tool that can underpin meaningful learning in medical education. However, student take-up may be affected by a number of cognitive and non-cognitive influences. In the present study, student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 conjoint MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were examined in relation to preferred learning styles according to the Felder-Silverman model. There was no statistically significant influence of dichotomous learning style dimension (sensing/intuitive; visual/verbal; active/reflector; sequential/global) on the self-reported utility of such concept maps to learning. However, when strength of preference was analysed within each dimension, moderate/strong verbal learners were found to be significantly less likely to self-report concept maps as useful relative to mild verbal learners. With this important exception, these data now suggest that student attitudes to concept maps are broadly not influenced by preferred learning styles and furthermore highlight the potential of concept maps to address a variety of different learning styles and thereby facilitate 'teaching to all types'. Concept maps could therefore potentially assist motivation, engagement and deep learning in medical and biomedical science education when used as a supplement to more traditional teaching/learning activities.

AB  - This study evaluated the comprehensiveness of current coping assessment and theory by examining people's perceptions of coping. Specifically, this study explored what people report using as coping strategies and attempted to reveal the underlying structure of people's perceptions of coping by using concept mapping methodology. Undergraduate students completed a two-phase study involving thought-listing, sorting, and labeling tasks. A two-dimensional map with nine clusters embedded in these dimensions was found to adequately conceptualize the results with participant-generated items. The two dimensions conveyed were approach-avoidance and emotional equilibrium-disequilibrium. The implications for these results are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Science content area texts are difficult for most middle school students, particularly whose reading skills are below grade level. This article describes an innovative approach to integrating the teaching of middle school science content and reading skills to increase levels of student success with content area textbooks. For reading instruction, this approach features carefully selected vocabulary, word reading instruction, oral (including partner reading) and silent reading with reading fluency practice as needed, and explicit instruction on comprehension strategies, such as retelling, concept mapping, and summarization. The teaching of the science content incorporates instructional design principles that have been documented to improve comprehension of science content, process skills, and higher order thinking. Six aspects of instructional design that are discussed are the identification and teaching of big ideas, the systematic instruction of vocabulary (including science affixes), a review and integration of core concepts, visual displays of how core concepts are integrated, mnemonics for core concepts, and structured hands-on activities.

AB  - This paper argues for the integration of metacognitive thinking into the content of school science. It describes the ' metacognitive instances ' approach of implanting metacognitive activities, such as classroom discussions, annotated drawing, keeping diary-like notes and concept-mapping, at selected points of the teaching procedure, in an attempt to extend the durability of children's science understanding, which is often short-lived. The approach was tested with 60 Year 5 pupils in Cyprus studying 'Current Electricity', following a quasiexperimental design with one experimental and one comparative group. Following the teaching of the unit, participants were tested on their understanding of electricity three times in one school year. The research showed that the practice of metacognition is feasible with primary school pupils and that children who experienced situated metacognition retained taught concepts for a longer period of time. Although no significant difference was recorded initially in the amount of subject matter learned by the two groups, children who engaged in metacognitive activities appeared to have achieved more permanent re-structuring of their understandings.

AB  - In the past three decades, there have been enormous advances in our understanding of the nature of knowledge and the processes by which humans construct new knowledge. There is now general agreement that knowledge is a human creation, where new ideas are constructed by creative people on the basis of their existing concepts and theories and of a search for new patterns or regularities in events or objects they observe. The constructed nature of knowledge means also that knowledge in every domain continues to evolve over time. We see concepts as the fundamental building blocks of knowledge, and we define concepts as perceived regularities or patterns in events or objects, or records of events or object, designated by a label, usually a word. There have been even greater advances in our understanding of human leaning in the past three decades. These advances have focused on the importance of learners' prior knowledge for the acquisition of new knowledge and on the need to sequence instruction to build upon the learners' existing concepts and proposition and that this process can be most productive when the learner consciously seeks to integrate new concepts and propositions into her/his congnitive structure, a process that requires meaningful learning, in contrast to the role learning or memorization so common in school learning. Since 1963, our work has been based on the congnitive psychology of David Ausubel, including the design of the audio-tutorial lessons used in a 12-year longitudinal study of children's science concept learning and the development of a tool we call a concept map to represent knowledge organized into cognitive structures. It has been possible to show explicitly the progressive growth in children's understanding of science concepts and propositions over time, and in some cases, the lack of such growth. Concept maps have subsequently been used to help students learn how to learn, to capture and archive expert knowledge, and to facilitate creative production. We have also shown that the learning capabilities of young children have been grossly underestimated, especially for "abstract" concepts about the nature of matter and energy (see, e.g., the recommendations for national science standards; National Research Council, 1996). In the past decade, there has been the incredible development of the Internet to share information on virtually any topic. Moreover, enormously increased computer power, transmission band width, and other technological advances now make it possible to provide to any learner almost anywhere in the world all of the information needed to gain mastery of any subject. We are currently seeking ways to exploit these potentials, especially with the use of new concept-mapping software, to help teachers and students 'scaffold' their learning, using expert concept maps and the collaborative possibilities of the new technologies.

AB  - Enumerates various paths that may lead to knowledge discovery (KD). Most of these paths begin from knowing what exists. To know what exists about an entity requires comprehensively assembling relevant data and information, in-depth analysis of the information, and identifying relations among the concepts in the related and even apparently unrelated subjects. Provision has to be made to reorganize and synthesize the information retrieved and/or that obtained through observation, experiment, survey, etc. Information and communication technologies (ICT) have considerably augmented the capabilities of information systems. Such ICT applications may range from the simple to sophisticated computerized systems, with data gathered using aerial photography, remote sensing, satellite imagery, large radar and planetary telescopes and many other instrument records of phenomena, as well as downloading via the Internet. While classification helps in data prospecting and data mining, for it to assist the KD process effectively it has to be supplemented with good indexes, hypertext links, access to statistical and modeling techniques, etc. Computer software assists text analysis, complex data manipulation, computation, statistical analysis, concept mapping, etc. But manual information systems can also assist KD. Enumerates several prerequisites to KD and relevant tools and techniques to be incorporated into information support systems. Presents case studies of information systems and services that assisted KD. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The research focus on children's science has recently shifted from separate concepts to more comprehensive and complex topics. This study addressed pupils' understanding of the complex topic of energy flow and matter cycling. A scoring system with three categories and six concepts was developed and used by four biology teachers to analyze 106 pupils' concept maps. The results indicate that most of the pupils failed to recognize the interrelationships among the various concepts concerned with units of energy flow and matter cycling. It was the relationship between the living world and the non-living world that presented the greatest difficult to understanding. This paper concludes with suggestions for curriculum development and biology teaching. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps are being used by an increasing number of educators in Europe and the US. This paper has four goals. First, it discusses problems in developing Novak's style concept maps in Turkish caused by linguistic differences between Turkish and English. Second, it reports the findings of a research study conducted to adapt concept maps to Turkish. Third, it recommends three methods for the adaptation resulting from research findings. Finally, it discusses the implications of the adaptation for educators worldwide and for future research. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Research has established that students enter their science classes with ideas about the natural world that do not align with accepted scientific beliefs. The diagnosis of these student preconceptions may be seen as an initial, crucial step in the process of teacher-facilitated conceptual change. So as to capture what science teachers do in their everyday classroom routines to diagnose these student preconceptions, in-depth observations and interviews were conducted with four exemplary secondary science teachers. The teachers' strategies for diagnosing students' preconceptions, their use of information found through diagnosis, and the teachers' understanding of students' preinstructional ideas were all analyzed. The four teachers in this study did not use any formal assessment tools such as pretests, concept maps, interviews, or journal writing to diagnose students' ideas, although they all stated that finding out what students know prior to instruction is important. The teachers all declared that they used questioning to gather information on student ideas but were seen in their classes to rely heavily on low-level, recall questions. One of the teachers, the most experienced, did conduct class discussions where the students were encouraged to express their ideas and preconceptions. The four teachers' understanding of what student preconceptions consist of and the justification for attempting to diagnose these ideas was seen to be weak. The implications of these findings and recommendations for teacher training are made in the article. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article considers effective dialogue between teacher and student essential for promoting meaningful learning in the classroom. Effective dialogue enables teachers and students to be active in the construction of shared understanding by making explicit the overlap between the perspective held by novice (student) and expert (teacher). Concept maps provide a visual tool to illustrate such overlap in understanding and create something tangible to promote meaningful discussion. A description of a model of practice to help uncover and explore this overlap is given. Key words: Concept mapping, Conceptual change, Constructivist teaching, Visual learning tools.

AB  - This article reports on the results of a nine-week investigation that examined the effectiveness of concept mapping on science achievement of 182 African American middle grade science students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes (by ability levels). Ability level was examined as a covariate on student achievement. For this sample of students, analyses of covariance indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that concept mapping has a positive effect on average (lower) ability level African American science students. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of combining conceptual change text and concept mapping strategy on students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis. Students' conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis was measured using the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test developed by Odom and Barrow (1995). The test was administered as pretest and post-test to a total of 44 ninth-grade students in two intact classes of the same high school located in an urban area. The experimental group was a class of 24 students who received concept mapping and conceptual change text instruction. A class of 20 students comprised the control group who received a traditional instruction. Group Assessment of Logical Thinking Test (GALT) and pretest scores were used as covariates in this study. A pretest-post-test control group design utilising the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the favour of the experimental group after treatment. The results indicated that while the average percentage of students in the experimental group holding a scientifically correct view had risen from 22.5% to 54.1%, a gain of 31.6%, the percentage of correct responses of the students in the control group had increased from 19.1% to 38.7%, a gain of 19.6% after treatment.

AB  - The AstraZeneca-Exeter Science through Telematics (AZEST) project provided evidence that the Internet has much potential as a communication channel for the provision and discussion of INSET materials for primary science in the UK. Participating teachers were able to access and use the project website effectively, were more likely to provide feedback when they had personal access to the Internet either at home or at school, and provided valuable feedback concerning the AZEST tasks, but they tended not to respond directly to messages from other participants. Discussion, via e-mail or a web-based discussion forum, was enhanced if participants knew each other personally. There was evidence that the AZEST science INSET materials enhanced teachers' understanding of science concepts and raised their confidence, increased teachers' effectiveness in the role of Science Subject Leader, and improved teachers' pedagogic practice through encouraging innovative investigative approaches to the teaching and learning of science. Participating teachers indicated that a website dedicated to primary science at the local level was valued. Concept mapping was found to be a valuable tool for stimulating discussion and for assessing pupils' and teachers' understanding and was mostly enjoyed by pupils and staff. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Understanding how people think and how people organise knowledge are always major concerns for educational researchers. Hence, educators have developed various ways of representing learners' 'cognitive structures'. This article provides a review of the use of five methods of representing cognitive structures -- free word association, controlled word association, tree construction, concept map and flow map. Through comparing the types of analyses that are generated from these cognitive structure representation methods, this paper discusses the applications, as well as the limitations, among these methods.

AB  - This cross-age study explored the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge about and attitudes toward sharks, and the relationships among knowledge and attitudes. Responses were elicited from a convenience sample of students (5th, 8th and 11th grade, and college level) and senior citizens (n = 238). All subjects constructed a concept map on sharks and responded to a Likert-type attitude inventory. Based on the work of Novak and Gowin (Leaning How to Learn, Cambridge University Press, 1984), concept maps were scored for frequencies of non-redundant concepts and scientifically valid relationships, levels of hierarchy, incidence of branching and number of crosslinks. The attitude inventory, emerging from Kellert's (The Value of Life: Biological Diversity and Human Society, Island Press, 1996) work, generated subscale scores on four affective dimensions: scientific, naturalistic, moralistic and utilitarian/negative. Significant differences were found among subject groups on all knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. Gender differences were documented on three of four attitude subscales. A series of simple, mulitiple and canonical correlations revealed moderately strong relationships between knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. The pattern of these relationships supports conservation education efforts and instructional practices that encourage meaningful learning, knowledge restructuring and conceptual change (Mintzes et al., Assessing Science Understanding: A Human Constructivist View, Academic Press, 2000).

AB  - The use of student-constructed concept maps in assessment is congruent with the changing emphases set forth by the National Science Education Standards. Authorities have expressed concern about concept map scoring systems and their associated validity and reliability. They favor methods that employ expert/criterion maps as referents and emphasize the use of accurate concept relationships in deriving scores, which have been found to correlate with performance on standardized tests. In this study, student constructed concept maps (n = 17) that emerged from postinstructional interviews about chlorofluorocarbons were scored against a teacher-expert map using a scheme weighted for relationships. Interrater reliability for the scoring scheme was high (r = .959). Students' map scores correlated highly with their scores on the California Achievement Test component total (r = .729) and moderately with their Pathfinder index (r = .474), the latter believed to be an excellent measure of structural knowledge. A revised map score, derived only from relationships containing one or more of the concepts employed in Pathfinder analysis, was a statistically significant (p = .031) predictor of the Pathfinder index. The findings of this study support the recommendations of others to use expert referents and emphasize concept relationships in assessing concept maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept mapping is described repeatedly in the literature as a tool that can support and enhance students' learning in science classrooms. Despite such endorsements, the use of concept mapping as a basis for classroom activities in UK secondary schools does not seem to be widespread. Some of the flaws in the supporting literature are highlighted. The two main barriers to the extensive adoption of concept mapping as an integral component of typical classroom strategies are seen as the epistemological beliefs of classroom teachers and the underlying philosophy of the curriculum that they are asked to deliver. In conclusion, concept mapping is seen as a tool that may support learning within an appropriate teaching ecology. Such an ecological perspective may require, for some, a re-conceptualization of the teacher's role in which teaching, learning and change are seen as integrated components of effective teaching.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether the construction of integrated knowledge structures by students can be stimulated by concept mapping and by better visualization of concepts and their interrelationships. The investigation was carried out in regular teaching settings: chemistry courses in secondary schools in Flanders, in the domain of electrochemistry. A significant positive effect of extra attention to visualization on the learning achievement of students was found. However, significant effects of concept mapping as an instruction method could not be detected under the given research conditions. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Conducted in Israel, this research probes students' understanding of the relationships between genetic concepts. Four populations were examined: 9th graders (14 - 15 year olds), who were exposed to genetics for the first time (n = 184); 12th graders (17 - 18 year olds), who were studying biology as their main subject (n = 121); college pre-service teachers, who had not yet earned a degree (n = 29); and university pre-service teachers, who had earned biology degrees and were seeking teacher certification (n = 22). Three research instruments were used: a written questionnaire, interviews, and concept maps. The questions were open-ended to enable the identification of students' patterns of comprehensive thinking and understanding, not identifiable in multiple choice testing. Alternative conceptions and compartmentalisation between related concepts were identified. Based on these findings, genetic instruction in 9th and 12th grade and in college needs improvement.

AB  - A novel method is described for analysing concept maps for research and analysis purposes. The coding system rates the use, the stability, and the complexity of each link, which is a unique way of representing students' knowledge. The analysis scheme affords a look at how students may integrate new knowledge into their existing structures and may be used for assessment purposes or research on how students learn. This coding system was successfully applied to a sample of 56 complex concept maps that had been generated from student interviews on the topic of chemical bonding. The coding system is of particular use when analysing complex concept maps with a large number of concept nodes and links. The system described here was also particularly useful for assessing complex, non-hierarchical concept maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper discusses several new assessment strategies that encourage meaningful learning and conceptual understanding in the biological sciences. Our purpose is to introduce a handful of evaluation and measurement techniques that help students assimilate well-integrated, strongly cohesive frameworks of interrelated concepts as a way of facilitating 'real understanding' of natural phenomena. Among these methods are concept maps, V diagrams, SemNet software, image-based test items, clinical interviews, portfolios, written products, performance measures, and conceptual diagnostic tests. Evidence suggests that these methods are most useful at highlighting 'alternative conceptions' and assisting students who wish to 'learn how to learn'. Key words: Assessment, Evaluation, Learning, Understanding. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Summarized are research findings and policy implications obtained over a 5 year period (51 teachers, 1200 students) from the implementation of an in-depth expanded applications of science (IDEAS) model with average, above average, and at-risk students in grades 2-5. The IDEAS model replaced the time allocated for traditional reading/language arts instruction with a daily 2 hour time-block dedicated solely to in-depth science concept instruction which encompassed reading comprehension and language arts skills (e.g. concept-focused teaching, hands-on activities, utilization of science process skills, reading of science print materials, concept map construction, journal writing). The multi-year results revealed a consistent pattern of the model's effectiveness in improving both the science understanding (effects on the Metropolitan Achievement Test-Science ranged from 0.93 to 1.6 grade equivalents) and reading achievement (effects on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills-Reading and the Stanford Achievement Tests-Reading ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 grade equivalents). Participating students also consistently displayed significantly more positive attitudes and self-confidence toward both science and reading. Interpreting the findings, the IDEAS model was considered to provide clear evidence for the importance of focusing the teaching-learning process on the conceptual structure of the curricular knowledge to be learned in a fashion consistent with research and policy issues raised by the recent TIMSS study. Also discussed was the role of the IDEAS model as a means for linking theoretical perspectives from instructional design and cognitive science to science educational reform. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract Concept mapping has been applied in a variety of fields, including instruction, learning, curriculum development, and assessment. Because many empirical studies have proven the validity of concept mapping, a computer-based concept mapping system has been developed. The system provides two learning environments. In the ‘construct-by-self’ environment, the system provides students with the evaluation results and corresponding hints for feedback. The students construct concept maps by themselves with only the assistance of the feedback. In the ‘construct-on-scaffold’ environment, in addition to the feedback, the students receive an incomplete concept map, within which some nodes and links were set as blanks for the scaffold. A study comparing the effectiveness of the ‘construct-by-self’, ‘construct-on-scaffold’, and ‘construct by paper-and-pencil’ concept mapping showed that the ‘construct-on-scaffold’ had better effect for learning on biology. Both of the two computer-based procedures are helpful for students in completing their concept maps. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Abstract The study reported in this paper developed and evaluated a web-based concept map testing system for science students. Thirty-eight Taiwanese high school students were involved and it was found that their performance on the system was not significantly related to their achievement as measured by traditional standard tests. Their views about the use of the system, in general, were positive. An analysis of students' future use of the system and their motivation and learning strategies revealed that those with more critical thinking metacognitive activities and an effort regulation management strategy showed more willingness to use the online testing system. Moreover, students with high test anxiety showed a preference to be tested through the system. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This article describes two related studies that began to explore the validity of scores from select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map assessments as measures of students' connected understanding of science. Scores from SAFI maps created for this purpose and used with middle school students and undergraduate astronomy students possessed high internal consistency and exhibited large mean increases with increased domain exposure. SAFI scores were strongly related to scores from a standardized multiple-choice (MC) achievement measure for middle school students; work with individual students suggested that they used strategies requiring connected understanding to successfully complete the maps. SAFI scores from undergraduate students exhibited large relationships with scores from direct-instruction MC exams and scores from a relatedness ratings measure, taken together and separately. Results provide initial evidence of the validity of scores from SAFI maps as measures of connected understanding of science in middle school and undergraduate introductory science students.

AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction to 10[supth]- grade students' understanding of the human circulatory system. To determine misconceptions concerning the human circulatory system, 10 eleventh-grade students were interviewed. In the light of the findings obtained from student interviews and related literature, the Human Circulatory System Concepts Test was developed The data were obtained from 26 students in the experimental group taught with the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping, and 23 students in the control group taught with the traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous learning in biology and science process skills were other independent variables involved in this study. Multiple Regression Correlation analysis revealed that science process skill, the treatment, and previous learning in biology each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students' understanding of the human circulatory system. It was found that the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction produced a positive effect on students' understanding of concepts. The mean scores of experimental and control groups showed that students in the experimental group performed better with respect to the human circulatory system. Item analysis was carried out to determine and compare the proportion of correct responses and misconceptions of students in both groups. The average percent of correct responses of the experimental group was 59.8%, and that of the control group was 51.6% after treatment. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Task-related variance causes scores from performance assessments not to be generalizable and thus inappropriate for high stakes use. It is possible that task-related variance is due, in part, to students' inability to transfer their knowledge consistently from one assessment task to another. Therefore, concept-mapping, a cognitive tool, might be useful to aid this transfer. This study examines the effects of concept maps on the task-related variance components of Political Science performance assessments. On three quizzes, some students used concept maps while writing two essays, while other students did not. The task variance components remained unchanged across groups, but the person main effect components increased and the task-by-person interaction components decreased for those using concept maps. Also, the scores from the concept mapping groups had higher generalizability coefficients than for those who did not use a concept map. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - This paper described an attempt of using a www-based concept map testing system, which was developed to assess high school students' concepts in physics. A total of ninety Taiwanese eleventh graders were tested through the on-line system and they, then, completed a questionnaire. The responses of the questionnaire revealed that the speed of information transferring, supported by the system was not quick enough. However, students did not think on-line test would cause some problems of cheating. More than a half of the subjects showed willingness of using the system in the future. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Increasing availability of technologies, such as CD ROMs and the World Wide Web, in schools means that more teachers will have the potential to implement student-centred, inquiry-based approaches to learning. Assessing what each student knows in a broad subject area, such as science, is difficult. Assessing students' understanding in circumstances where each student may pursue different topics of study, where there is no way to predict in advance what those topics of study will be and where the possible topics of study include natural phenomena which are only beginning to be studied by professional scientists, is even more difficult. The authors recently faced such a challenge. To meet the challenge, the authors chose to assess student learning using an open-ended concept map activity combined with a rubric which extracts quantitative information about the quality of understanding from each map. This article describes the method the authors developed, including tests of reliability and validity. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - ABSTRACT Low-achieving seventh-grade students from an urban parochial school were randomly assigned to two equally sized groups (n = 62, each group). One group was taught by a read-and-discuss, teacher-directed method, and the second group, given the same type of introductory lesson as the first, followed a model of concept mapping that connected major and minor concept ideas. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a science chapter served as the dependent variable, Prior to any teaching, a pretest was administered, An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate showed a statistically significant difference in comprehension between the pretest and posttest for the experimental group. Effect size estimates revealed that concept mapping can be expected to improve comprehension scores of low-achieving seventh graders by approximately six standard deviations over a traditional instructional technique. When students lack background information on a topic to aid comprehension, the active participation in constructing semantic or concept maps may help students form a cognitive schema to assimilate and relate the new topic information.

AB  - This paper advocates the application of established teaching models to the professional development of biology teachers. This is achieved by using the analogy of conceptual ecologies, made explicit through concept mapping. The approach is designed to support teachers' developing understanding of pupils' conceptual change by using familiar terminology and biological analogies. Monitoring of students' understanding at an ecosystemic level may also help distinguish between instances of conceptual change and contextual switching (described here with reference to photosynthesis).

AB  - ABSTRACT. The study examined how features of student interaction, and the way an individual student contributes to that interaction (his or her participation), relates to the improvement of conceptual understanding within the domain of physics. The study also investigated how textbooks are used during collaborative work and how that use affects the quality of student interaction and outcomes. The participants were 56 students aged 15 or 16. The students worked in dyads on a concept-mapping task that functioned as an introduction for a new course about electricity. A condition in which the students were provided with 2 textbooks was compared with a condition without the availability of textbooks. The use of textbooks had a negative influence on the amount of elaboration and coconstruction in the student interaction. Individual learning outcomes were positively related to the amount of collaborative elaboration in the student interaction. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Economic constraints, profound changes in the healthcare system and insufficient educational expertise have gripped medical education. The objective of this study was to review professionalization of medical education and to contribute to an elaboration of a conceptual framework for understanding reforms. We developed a concept map based on information retrieved by searching the Medline/Knowledge Finder and the Cochrane Library databases. The descriptors used for the searches were 'certification, credentialing, education, faculty medical, quality assurance health care, research, staff development, teaching'. The endpoints for the study were: frequency, quality of studies and propositional content with regard to professionalization for developing a concept map. Thirty-one relevant studies were found in Medline.The Cochrane Library search returned no relevant studies. The evidence of the few studies was weak. The literature-derived concept map shows that faculty development is a prerequisite for certification leading to professionalization. Other related variables were resource allocation, intrinsic motivation to learn, educational research, study time, financial policy, organizational and staff development, and new specialized roles such as clinician-educator. It is concluded that professionalization of medical education is needed. This deficit underscores the need for conceptually sound research approaches. The concept of intrinsic motivation explains how to comply with scientifically based standards, thus fostering professionality. Approaches facilitating compliance, such as evidence-based learning, potentially professionalize the practice of medical education. Novel approaches such as quality management and best evidence medical education could professionalize medical education. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - An increasing number of collaborative learning environments is based on shared workspace systems using two-dimensional graph-structured visual representations such as argumentation networks and concept maps. We propose an integrated framework that allows for flexibly specifying a wide range of visual languages and plugging in components for operational semantics, adequate feedback and intelligent support. The generic application CardBoard provides card-based user interaction and collaboration by means of different languages in shared workspaces. To enhance modifiability, the interfaces between the distributed heterogeneous system components, particularly between intelligent components and user interfaces, have been standardised.

AB  - This follow-up study explored successive and progressive changes in the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge held by students enrolled in an advanced, undergraduate, university-level biology course. To examine the way learners restructure their knowledge during the semester, subjects constructed concept maps at intervals of four-six weeks. The concept maps were scored for structural complexity and propositional validity based on a modified version of Novak and Gowin's methods, and for structural change based on the work of Rumelhart and Norman. Results support previous findings that a significant amount of 'weak' knowledge restructuring occurs, resulting in an incremental, cumulative and limited form of conceptual change. However, the most 'radical' type of 'strong' restructuring (involving wholesale, abrupt and extensive change) is concentrated during the first six weeks of the course. The findings also suggest that gender plays a significant mediating effect in knowledge restructuring. Significant differences favouring females were found in the number of crosslinks depicted and a significant interaction, also favouring females, was found in the amount of branching. Finally, clinical interviews with rote and meaningful learners suggest that the latter group displays an enhanced level of awareness, and a stronger ability to monitor, regulate and control their own learning. The significance of these findings for research and practice are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of two generative learning strategies, concept mapping and laboratory experiments involving object manipulation, to determine if either one is more effective with individual learners or learning groups in a science classroom. Eighty sixth-grade science students were randomly assigned to group or individual conditions and to one of two experimental treatments. Experimental treatments were changed between a first and second posttest. Long-term retention was evaluated with a third, delayed posttest. Students starting with concept maps showed higher achievement on the delayed posttest than students beginning with the laboratory experiment. No difference was found between students working as individuals or in groups, but a significant interaction between generative learning strategy and grouping condition was revealed. Implications for sequencing generative learning strategies are discussed. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - Concept maps have been used extensively in science education both to promote and to measure meaningful learning. This study examines the use of concept maps to measure tertiary science students' understanding of fundamental concepts in statistical inference. Different methods of scoring maps are examined, and a revised scheme developed. Student scores on concept maps of two aspects of statistics, namely problem definition and statistical inference, are compared before and after a practical statistical investigation conducted by the students. The concept map scores are also compared with marks awarded for the practical assignment. While there was no significant improvement in concept map scores over time, some significant correlations were found between aspects of the concept map scores and scores on the practical assignment. Valuable qualitative information can be gained from an investigation of student concept maps, which enables clarification of student misconceptions, and which cannot be obtained from traditional assessment methods.

AB  - This study evaluated concept maps spontaneously constructed by applicants (N = 502) in a medical school entrance examination. In all, 36 maps were produced. Concept maps were evaluated for content of relevant terms and for the number of interrelationships indicated. The aim was to determine whether including relevant ideas on a concept map is related to the learning of those ideas. Because concept maps are effective tools for making the structure of knowledge explicit, it was hypothesized that the quality and content of spontaneously made maps would be related to improvement in the comprehension of text material. Understanding was assessed in terms of success in essay-type tasks designed to measure the ability to define, explain, and apply statistical knowledge. The results indicated that merely including the relevant concepts in a map has little effect on the comprehension of those concepts, whereas the extent and complexity of concept maps plays a powerful role in the understanding of scientific texts.

AB  - A naturalistic study, with two cycles of intervention, was carried out to investigate the effects of two methods of introducing concept mapping to students taking introductory subjects in genetics in an Australian university. Some of these students‘ views relating to concept mapping were also investigated in the years following its introduction. The results of this study suggest that the method of introduction can influence students‘ perception of concept mapping, and its potential benefit. Although most students taking introductory subjects had taken part in the project, and many had realised the benefits of concept mapping, retrospective views of students indicated that almost none had adopted it as a regular part of study strategies. This outcome raises several questions in regard to introducing learning tools to students and, in particular, the reasons for doing so. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

AB  - n this study, concept mapping was assessed as an instructional strategy for use by high school students in learning biology concepts. Concept mapping, which requires learners to plot concepts and their interrelations in a meaningful organizational network, was compared with an established curriculum approach and tested in an interaction with learners of varying verbal ability. The design emphasized external validity. As hypothesized, concept mapping facilitated low-ability learners’ performance, but only on higher level, relational knowledge. The usefulness of the technique was discussed in terms of its ability to individualize and raise the quality of learning with little extra effort or resource costs to the instructional system.
