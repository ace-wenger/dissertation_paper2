T1  - A multi-modal multiple descriptive case study of graduate students’ statistical thinking in statistical tests seven months after completing a simulation-based introductory level course
AN  - 2876086647; 2024-00965-166
AB  - Though statistical testing is commonly practiced, the logic of statistical tests is confusing, thinking about distributions is difficult, and the way statisticians formulate expectations as probability distributions is poorly understood. To support instruction, the statistics education community has increasingly utilized simulation-based pedagogies that place the logic of statistical inference at the core of instruction. Might this approach support and sustain the development of graduate students' statistical thinking, especially during statistical testing? How do graduate students, who have completed a simulation-based course, think while conducting statistical tests, months after completing the course? To answer these questions, a multi-modal multiple descriptive case study of six graduate students in the educational sciences was conducted. Data sources included audio, video, and gaze recordings, analytic memos generated by the researcher, as well as written artifacts generated by the participants. Participants generated concept maps for the logic of statistical tests, conducted statistical tests using statistical software, interpreted results from statistical tests, and participated in a retrospective video-cued interview. Data were analyzed through an interpretivist epistemological stance and employed the constant comparative method to identify relevant moments across all data artifacts to credibly describe participants' thinking. Results suggest that students' planning (i.e., deciding what to do and when to do it) was generally quite good. However, students generally struggled in monitoring and evaluating their plan (i.e., ensuring that the plan was being executed correctly, and that no changes to the plan were needed). Furthermore, they generally did not seem to think about null models, core to the logic of statistical testing. Instead, they focused on point and interval estimates for statistics of interest, and primarily thought about sampling variability in terms of a bootstrap dot plot, if at all. This study is one of the first to examine graduate students' statistical thinking several months after the completion of a simulation-based introductory course. How students were thinking – generally able to reproduce a plan for analyzing the data consistent with what they were taught, and with a focus on variability through the examination of a bootstrap dot plot – suggests that statistics instructors might anchor instruction about statistical tests to descriptive statistics and their interpretation and contextualization. Furthermore, it suggests that the likelihood approach to statistical inference, evaluating hypotheses against given data, may be conceptually easier for students to think about.

T1  - To ask better questions, teach: Learning-by-teaching enhances research question generation more than retrieval practice and concept-mapping
AN  - 2818895504; 2023-75198-001
AB  - Asking good questions is vital for scientific learning and discovery, but improving this complex skill is a formidable challenge. Here, we show in two experiments (N = 152) that teaching others—
learning-by-teaching—enhances one’s ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge, relative to two other well-established generative learning techniques: retrieval practice and concept-mapping. Learners who taught scientific expository texts across natural and social sciences topics by delivering video-recorded lectures outperformed their peers who practiced retrieval or constructed concept maps when tested on their ability to generate create-level research questions based on the texts (Experiment 1). This advantage held reliably even on a delayed test 48 hr later, and when all learners similarly received and responded to poststudy questions on the material (Experiment 2). Moreover, across both immediate and delayed tests, learning-by-teaching produced a recall benefit that rivaled that of the potent technique of retrieval practice. In contrast, despite recalling more than twice the study content that the concept-mapping group did, learners who practiced retrieval were unable to generate more 
create-level research questions based on that content. Three supplemental experiments (
N = 168) further showed that retrieval practice consistently did not improve higher-order question generation over restudying, despite yielding superior long-term retention. Altogether, these findings reveal that simply possessing a wealth of factual knowledge is insufficient for generating higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Rather, teaching others is a powerful strategy for producing deep and durable learning that enables research question generation. To ask better questions, teach.

Across immediate and delayed tests, students who taught scientific material by delivering a video-recorded lecture successfully generated more create-level research questions based on the material, as compared to their peers who used well-established learning methods such as retrieval practice and concept-mapping. While we teach, we learn to ask better research questions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Enhancing memory recall during video lectures: Does the visual display format matter?
AN  - 2845195273; 2023-95583-001
AB  - Lectures containing information presented in verbal and visual form are widely used in educational settings. To date, little is known about how the visual display in a video lecture influences immediate and delayed recall. In two experiments, participants listened to a pre-recorded lecture while viewing an animated concept map, sequential listing of bulleted text, or there was no visual display. Results indicated that the concept map lecture enhanced immediate recall accuracy; however, the type of ideas recalled is also important to consider. Compared to the listen-only lecture, the concept map and bulleted text lectures promoted more recall of main ideas rather than details. Finally, the concept map lecture mainly benefitted those with high prior science achievement. These findings suggest that the visual display in a video lecture may affect the type of ideas remembered, and prior knowledge should be considered when choosing how to present information in a video lecture.

T1  - Practical way to apply fourth-generation assessment tools integrated into creating meaningful learning experiences in biology at high school
AN  - 2784892859; 2023-27066-001
AB  - The learning process for a Biology topic regarding organisms and animal kingdom diversity was investigated through an innovative Interactive Didactic Sequence (IDS) which integrated the idea of “concept maps” with the Hermeneutic-Dialectic Circle (HDC). HDC is a tool for data collection and a reference for pluralist-constructivist thinking, considered a form of fourth-generation evaluation. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were also integrated into the investigation in order to facilitate mediation in an evaluative context. Students' performances (N = 25) from a São Paulo-Brazil public school were statistically evaluated. Their cultural profile was determined via the Hofstede Value Survey Model 1994 questionnaire. The elaborative process of arranging concept maps was individual (CM-individual) and integrated with HDC in groups (CM-HDC). Concept map assessment methods were based off existing literature. An improvement in students' performances (p < 0.05) that presented concept maps integrated to HDC in a more complex structure when compared to individually-built maps was observed. Employment of HDC helped form motivational/interactive dialogues between students and teachers, which, in turn, assisted in achieving greater learning through the use of concept maps. The application of the fourth-generation evaluation was improved via knowledge regarding students' cultural profiles. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Culturally sensitive delivery of school-based services to Salvadorian immigrant students: A comprehensive review and analysis of the literature
AN  - 2803509657; 2023-46640-247
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use a comprehensive review and analysis of the literature to help fill the research gap regarding school-based services for Salvadorian immigrant youth in the United States. Using Bronfenbrenner's ecological systems theory, journal articles were critically analyzed for the five elements of the ecological subsystems. The study reviewed thirty documents, including research studies, articles, and book chapters under three topics; Salvadorian immigrant youth and families, trauma intervention literature, and cultural competence literature. Content relational concept mapping analysis was used to determine what themes from trauma intervention literature address the unique cultural and historical experiences of Salvadorian immigrant youth. Twenty-one themes were derived from coding Salvadorian specific literature. Most emergent themes were family, Religion, respect for teachers, immigration journey/status/policy, violence, psychoeducation for caregivers, and mental health impacts. All twenty-one themes were found in trauma intervention literature and cultural competence literature with higher instances of coded themes under teachers, psychoeducation for caregivers, mental health impacts, and family themes. Results indicate there are several ways in which trauma intervention literature and cultural competence literature showcases the potential abilities of schools to provide culturally sensitive interventions to Salvadorian immigrant youth and take into consideration the ecological environment in which a Salvadorian immigrant student resides. From the findings, a checklist was created for professionals to inform themselves on Salvadorian history and culture in order to help cultivate meaningful mesosystemic relationships with children and families and tailor interventions to be culturally sensitive.

T1  - Making sense of and navigating the stem vapor: A qualitative study of a single school community’s attempts to understand the STEM institution
AN  - 2762072576; 2023-10932-164
AB  - Despite its significant role in every level of education, the definition of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics movement, or STEM, has remained elusive, becoming so vaporous as to provide little meaning. As education organizations navigate the STEM institution, they must collectively make sense of its norms, goals, and practices. Yet little is known about this process, including what sense is made, contributing factors, and implications. This paper describes a study guided by relational ethnography conducted in one K-8 school community that investigates how its members make sense of the STEM institution through cycles of interpretation and action. Sensemaking is investigated through interviews, concept maps, and surveys conducted with nine teachers, administrators, and external partners in the community along with analysis of school and external organization documents. Results are organized around three themes: the external nature of STEM, the process of sensemaking, and collective sensemaking in partnerships. First, the tension between the messy, amorphous institution of STEM and the organizational and personal context of teachers, disciplines, school, and community is described. It is proposed that the interpretation of STEM as external to the local context may contribute to a problem of curriculum narrowing, whereby aspects of disciplinary instruction, namely higher-order thinking skills, are also omitted. Second, four key factors influencing sensemaking of STEM are demonstrated: individual frames, disparate messaging from the environment, collaboration, or the lack thereof, and external partnerships. The factors are shown to provide dual obstacles to implementation of STEM as well as to contextual, collective sensemaking about STEM. Third, an investigation of external partnerships provide evidence for the institutions' messy and inequitable qualities. The paper concludes with a theory that resistance to STEM implementation demonstrated by study participants suggests problems lie not with a lack of clear institutional messages, but with an understanding by teachers that STEM, as presented, has little to do with their practice. Therefore, efforts to use STEM as a vehicle for implementing standards-based practices like higher-order thinking skills may be problematic. The paper concludes with proposals for research understanding the conflict between STEM and contextual, disciplinary practice, including epistemological and structural tensions.

T1  - Enacting occupation and identity: Perspectives of children and their parents
AN  - 2735908252; 2023-01884-059
AB  - Children with disabilities are at risk for limited opportunities to engage in childhood occupations. Occupation is defined broadly as everything people need, want, or are obliged to do, and as understanding how social dimensions shape occupations and opportunities for participation. Emergent literature suggests that identities are shaped by what we do. This research examines how occupation is implicated in the shaping of identities for school-aged children with physical disabilities in light of the socio-cultural dimensions that shape opportunities for children to participate in childhood occupations. This work is comprised of five integrated manuscripts, in addition to introduction, methodology, and discussion chapters. The first manuscript contributes to disciplinary discussions about occupational identity as an emerging construct and calls for a socio-cultural theoretical perspective to considerations of occupational identity. The second manuscript examines a disability studies perspective, and introduces the concept of reflexivity as important for professional practice in occupational therapy. The third manuscript discusses photoelicitation as a promising method for eliciting children's perspectives in research. In addition philosophical underpinnings, practical considerations, ethical considerations, and examples from this research are discussed. The fourth manuscript reports on the empirical work, examining how occupation is implicated in the shaping of identity for children with physical disabilities. In depth case studies were used to investigate participation in occupations and perceptions of identity with six children and their parents. Each case was analyzed using concept maps and coded for conceptual categories. Six categories are presented: Perceptions of Self and Other: Living with Disability; Family Identity, Tradition and Culture; Relational Identity: A Sense of Belonging; Pride, Success, and Seeing things through…; Growing up and Keeping Up; and Identity as Dynamic. Finally, the fifth manuscript revisits the topic of reflexivity, and discusses its merit in ethical research with children. This thesis contributes to knowledge pertaining to socio-cultural factors that shape opportunities for children to participate in occupations, and the relationship between occupation and identity for children with physical disabilities. In addition this work contributes to methodological and ethical discussions about conducting research with children. This work has implications for occupational science, health care professionals, policy, children and parents. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Holistic nursing process maps: A tool for student nurses to operationalize the nursing process to increase clinical reasoning
AN  - 2730343795; 2022-90097-136
AB  - Clinical reasoning (CR) has been identified as a required skill for nursing graduates as a part of the broader term of clinical judgment (Benner et al., 2010). The nursing process is a critical thinking framework unique to nursing and designed to support CR. The ability to use CR in nursing is tested in the United States through high-stakes licensure examination. As a response to the high-stakes testing required to enter the profession of nursing, nursing education has sought to identify ways to improve students' development of CR. The concept map (CM) has been introduced into nursing education as a tool to increase the development of CR. There is abundant research on the efficacy of the CM as a learning tool in many professional fields. Existing literature does not define the key components of the CM or the relationship to the nursing process. There is very little evidence of nursing students' experiences in using the CM during nursing school. Novice nursing students lack the understanding or expertise to identify the key components of the CM that are essential to their learning. Overlaying the nursing process with a concept map that guides the novice student through the key components of the nursing process will allow the student to operationalize the nursing process and develop essential clinical reasoning skills. Incorporating and developing a student-friendly nursing-specific Holistic Nursing Process Map (HNPM) in nursing education will contribute to the overall improvement of nursing education. The purpose of this study is to introduce an author-developed concept map titled the HNPM to nursing students to identify a correlation between operationalizing the nursing process in the HNPM and the development of clinical reasoning skills in the pre-licensure nursing students' first semester in the program of medical surgical nursing. Results indicate an inability to conclusively correlate the use of the HNPM and the development of clinical reasoning in the first semester medical surgical nursing student. There was no significant effect for the intervention group in development of clinical reasoning. There were differences in the development of clinical reasoning as measured by the health sciences reasoning test between campuses and between ethnicities, as well as prior healthcare experience without relationship to the use of the HNPM. Future research is recommended with a larger number of participants, increased fidelity of the use of the HNPM, and completion of the health sciences reasoning post-test by addressing identified challenges to increase participation. Qualitative research may be valuable in identifying differences in the development of clinical reasoning among different demographic groups.

T1  - Concept mapping in technology-supported K-12 education: A systematic review of selected SSCI publications from 2001 to 2020
AN  - 2743501234; 2023-06006-002
AB  - Concept maps have been verified as an effective learning tool in technology-supported learning environments, in particular, in K-12 education. To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed.

T1  - Supporting reflection to improve learning from self-generated concept maps
AN  - 2661136382; 2022-60556-001
AB  - Creating concept maps is considered to be a powerful means for learning. It requires students to systematically organize and integrate their knowledge, which can foster meaningful learning. However, students scarcely spontaneously engage in the (meta)cognitive processes necessary for effective knowledge integration, such as reflection, which can hamper the effectiveness of concept mapping for learning. This study explores the effect of additional support that stimulates reflection by means of expert examples, reflection prompts, and classroom discussion. First-year technical vocational students (
N = 144, 
M 
age = 17.5 years) studied electricity-related topics in an online learning environment and created concept maps about their knowledge. Students’ concept maps were supplemented with either (1) no support (control condition), (2) an expert example (a combined concept map, containing their own and an expert example concept map, with differences highlighted), (3) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually, (4) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually after a teacher-guided classroom discussion. Students in the classroom discussion condition showed higher learning gains compared to all other conditions. This can be explained by the quality of their reflection, which proved to be a significant predictor of learning gain. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Differential analysis of the years of experience of higher education teachers, their digital competence and use of digital resources: Comparative research methods
AN  - 2547069879; 2021-61645-001
AB  - This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0–5 years, 6–14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Deliberate errors promote meaningful learning
AN  - 2615319103; 2022-17587-001
AB  - Our civilization recognizes that errors can be valuable learning opportunities, but for decades, they have widely been avoided or, at best, allowed to occur as serendipitous accidents. The present research tested whether greater learning success could paradoxically be achieved through making errors by intentional design, relative to traditional errorless learning methods. We show that deliberately committing and correcting errors even when one knows the correct answers enhances learning—a counterintuitive phenomenon that we termed the 
derring effect. Across two experiments (
N = 160), learners engaged in open-book study of scientific expository texts and were then tested on their retention and higher-order application of the material to analyze a novel news event. Deliberate error commission and correction during study produced not only better recall performance, but also superior knowledge application compared to two errorless study techniques that are popular among students and educational researchers: copying with underlining, and elaborative studying with concept mapping (Experiment 1). These learning benefits persisted even over generating alternative conceptually correct answers, revealing that the derring effect is not merely attributable to generation or elaboration alone, but is unique to producing incorrect responses (Experiment 2). Yet, learners were largely unaware of these advantages even after experiencing them. Our results suggest that avoiding errors in learning may not always be most optimal. Rather, deliberate erring is a powerful strategy to enhance meaningful learning. We discuss implications for educational practice in redesigning conventional approaches to errors: To err is human; to 
deliberately err is divine. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

derring effect—deliberately committing and correcting errors even when we know the correct answers enhances learning.

T1  - Vocational training with microlearning—How low-immersive 360-degree learning environments support work-process-integrated learning
AN  - 2889365215; 2024-14854-002
AB  - In-company training is facing new challenges in preparing employees for the demands of digitalized and automated manufacturing. New training concepts like microlearning are necessary to support work-process-related learning. To handle the limitations of microlearning, we develop a 360-degree learning system to demonstrate a realistic work environment and overcome the lack of design knowledge supporting the motivation and performance of employees using such systems. Based on a systematic literature review and semistructured interviews, we have developed design requirements for interactive 360-degree learning environments. We used a workshop-based mixed-method approach with interviews, concept maps, and video analysis to evaluate the motivation and performance of precision mechanics within a prototypical work-process-oriented learning environment in an intercompany vocational training center. The results show a positive effect on learning outcomes and motivation. In addition, the ease of use and sense of presence while using the learning environment are rated as high. We contribute to theory by shedding new light on learners’ motivation and performance within work-process-oriented interactive 360-degree learning environments. Furthermore, we offer guidelines for developing interactive 360-degree learning environments against the background of the current metaverse discussion.

T1  - Understanding complex ecosystems through an agent-based participatory watershed simulation
AN  - 2872956827; 2022-98601-011
AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students—even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Shame and pride among social workers in Israel: A concept map
AN  - 2869682644; 2023-13953-023
AB  - The research on shame and pride among social workers is in its infancy. Given the potential consequences of these emotions on social workers and social work practice, this study had two main aims: (i) to identify practice situations in which social workers in Israel felt shame and pride and (ii) to classify and map these situations into conceptual domains. A concept mapping approach was used to achieve these aims. Eighty social workers recruited via social networks and snowballing participated in the statement generation of experiences of shame and pride in their daily practice. The sample was diverse in terms of seniority, role (managerial/frontline), populations served and agencies. The process yielded ten clusters, six of them representing sources of shame and four sources of pride. Based on the statements comprising the clusters, it can be argued that the ability of social workers to advance change can serve as an organising concept for comparing shame and pride. Not being able to promote desired change induces shame, while promoting such change fosters pride. These outcomes can be explained by self-discrepancy theory. The article discusses the implications of the study's results for theory, practice and research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)
 (Source: journal abstract) Impact statementMany of the situations yielded by the concept mapping procedure are consistent with those reported by previous researchers. This consistency suggests that the conditions reported are part and parcel of social work practice. The relative positions of the sources of shame in the map may stem from the workers’ internalisation of the abusive situations to which they are exposed: their poor work conditions, their inability to provide adequate services and the devaluation of them and their work. Separately and together, each of these situations may impact how social workers perceive themselves and their work. As for the pride clusters, the social workers depicted situations of success in achieving service users’ desired outcomes, their own ability to mobilise external resources to promote positive change and their being part of a force for change. Findings also show that the participants identified more with the statements representing pride than with those representing shame. The reasons may be that they experience more pride-inducing situations in their work, are less aware of shame-inducing situations, or are less prone to acknowledge such situations.

T1  - Building a self-evolving imonsters board game for cyber-security education
AN  - 2719024245; 2023-06012-001
AB  - ABSTRACT In this paper, to handle the problem of the quick evolution of cyber-security attacks, we developed the iMonsters board game and proposed the attack and defense knowledge self-evolving algorithm. Three versions of the iMonsters were launched in 2013, 2017, and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, the cyber-security ontology can be refined by the ontology fusion-or-splitting procedure for the newly collected cyber-security incidents, as well as the roles and rules of the iMonsters can be refined by the gaming portfolio mining procedure for the collected portfolio. Furthermore, we conducted game-based learning (GBL), a quasi-experiment of pre/post-testing, and concept map testing using the iMonsters board game in a children’s summer camp. The experimental results indicate that the students can acquire up-to-date cyber-security knowledge with the iMonsters better than students who learn in a traditional classroom setting, and the students’ satisfaction with acquiring cyber-security knowledge with the instructional design of the iMonsters is better compared with learning in a traditional classroom setting. Satisfaction with the new version has continuously increased. Besides, the results of the in-depth interviews show that the new version was easier to learn. Thus, we may conclude that using the self-evolving iMonsters can improve learning effectiveness and participation in GBL. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A concept mapping-based prediction-observation-explanation approach to promoting students’ flipped learning achievements and perceptions
AN  - 2857910680; 2023-03066-015
AB  - Previous research has illustrated the potential of flipped learning for assisting teachers in designing meaningful activities to promote students’ higher order thinking skills; however, several previous studies have challenged the effects of flipped learning on students’ learning. One of the key problems is the lack of an effective learning approach or tools to engage students in the flipped learning activity. In this study, a concept mapping-based Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE) approach was incorporated into flipped learning (called CPOE-FL) to enhance students’ scientific learning. Furthermore, a three-group experiment was conducted to assess the effects of the three flipped learning models, comprising the CPOE-FL approach, the POE-FL (incorporating POE into flipped learning) approach, and the C-FL (conventional flipped learning) approach. The experimental results displayed that the CPOE-FL approach can benefit the learning achievements and self-efficacy of the students with respectively lower prior knowledge and lower initial self-efficacy, in comparison with the POE-FL and C-FL approaches. Both the CPOE-FL and POE-FL approaches promoted the students’ inner learning motivation, while the CPOE-FL approach enhanced the students’ critical thinking. This proposed approach could provide a good reference for researchers or school teachers intending to implement POE-based flipped learning in the future.

T1  - CLIL: Graphic organisers and concept maps for noun identification within bilingual primary education natural science subject textbooks
AN  - 2753359663; 2022-67920-004
AB  - Though concept maps and graphic organisers are useful tools for bilinguals to organise the information being managed and learned, its systematic use is not widened and decisive in CLIL domains. Apart from helping students to acquire meaningful learning, concept mapping might promote in them word-recognition skills for the identification and management of relevant information within foreign language (L2) texts. Hence, this article inquires into the influence of concept maps and graphic organisers as tools for noun category identification from L2 texts. Research sample comprises sixty Spanish primary education students from a bilingual school. Design is 
quasi-experimental, and the training programme lasted three weeks. Materials used during the training period are not exceptional, but the ordinarily found in regular classrooms. Data gathering procedure consists of the identification and circling of nouns by sample participants. As a starting point, secondary data as the intelligent quotient, learning style, and English level is collected via standardised tests. The analysis of the variance showed a highly significant interaction between the groups and the implemented texts both for noun identification (F
3.171 = 12.124, p < 0.000, η² = 0.175), and the grammatical categories mistakenly identified as nouns (F
3.171 = 3.840, p < 0.016, η² = 0.063). (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Do curious students learn more science in an immersive virtual reality environment? Exploring the impact of advance organizers and epistemic curiosity
AN  - 2699732306; 2022-48297-001
AB  - Past studies have found mixed results of the impact of immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments on students' learning. In this study, we examined the effect of using concept maps, a kind of advance organizer, on students' learning of science via IVR. In this exploratory and immersive learning environment, we also explored the roles played by learners' epistemic curiosity and other affective factors. Seventy-four sixth-grade students participated in this research and were randomly assigned to the advance organizer group (AO; experimental group) and the non-advance organizer group (NAO; control group). Data collection included survey questionnaires and a science test for assessing students' understanding of plants. We examined the structural relationships among students’ curiosity and affective factors (including presence, control and active learning, positive emotional engagement, and negative emotional engagement), and compared the learning outcomes of the experimental and control groups. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for the data analysis. The results showed that students in the AO group had significantly higher scores for science concepts than those in the NAO group. In both groups, the interest-type curiosity and control and active learning positively predicted emotional engagement. Moreover, in the AO group, positive emotional engagement positively predicted the scientific knowledge of plant concepts. Implications for future research and instructional design are suggested in the study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - An integrated concept mapping and image recognition approach to improving students' scientific inquiry course performance
AN  - 2823671052; 2022-53143-014
AB  - Scholars and researchers generally believe that scientific inquiry is an important activity for cultivating students' applied knowledge and high‐level thinking ability. The process of scientific inquiry can promote students' learning motivation and trigger their higher‐order thinking ability. However, students may not have enough prior knowledge or they may lack inquiry experience, which may influence the effectiveness of their inquiry learning. Besides, in a scientific inquiry environment assisted by technology, students must face abundant and diverse learning resources, and may not effectively organize and carry out advanced cogitation to solve problems. Therefore, this research proposed an integrated concept mapping and image recognition (IR) approach to help students effectively acquire and organize knowledge in the process of scientific inquiry. This study applied a quasi‐experimental design to verify the effect of this proposed approach. The experimental group conducted the concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach, whilst the control group conducted the conventional IR‐based learning approach to evaluate the students' performance in terms of their learning motivation and learning achievements. The participants were two classes of 10th‐grade students in northern Taiwan. One was the experimental group with 22 students, whilst the other was the control group with 22 students. The experimental results show that the students learning with the CM‐IR learning approach had better learning achievement, attitudes and intrinsic motivation, as well as higher mental load than those learning with the conventional IR‐based learning approach. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided for future research in this field. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)
 (Source: journal abstract) Impact statementPractitioner notes: What is already known about this topic With the development of information technology, AI has attracted the attention of researchers. Image recognition (IR) is one of the AI applications, and has been used to support learning in various educational fields. Researchers have indicated that concept mapping is an effective instructional strategy and promotes students' knowledge construction. What this paper adds A concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach is proposed to improve students' scientific inquiry performance. A quasi‐experimental design was conducted with 10th‐grade students on the ‘Plant identification’ unit of the scientific inquiry course. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve students' learning achievement, learning motivation and learning attitude. Implications for practice and/or policy The CM‐IR learning approach could be an effective method to facilitate students' learning performances and motivation in scientific inquiry. It is worth promoting the CM‐IR learning approach in school settings since it is low‐cost and enables learning anywhere using mobile devices. Scholars and educators are encouraged to work on how AI technologies applications can be applied to support learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A concept mapping-based self-regulated learning approach to promoting students’ learning achievement and self-regulation in stem activities
AN  - 2651809227; 2022-54807-001
AB  - ABSTRACT STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is attracting increasing attention, but how to improve students’ STEM learning achievement is still a big challenge. In the process of learning, students actively set learning goals, organize learning content, set learning standards, and independently adapt learning strategies and monitoring measures in order to achieve their own learning goals and to help them learn STEM knowledge and skills. Concept mapping is considered to be an effective visualized knowledge organizing tool that helps students to manage and organize their knowledge systematically and visually. This study proposes a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning approach. A quasi-experiment was conducted using a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning system in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improved students’ STEM skills, but not their STEM knowledge compared to the conventional self-regulated learning approach. The proposed learning approach helped to improve students’ self-regulation compared to the conventional self-regulation learning approach. In short, the concept mapping-based self-regulation learning approach enhances students’ self-efficacy and self-regulation, which in turn helps students to learn STEM skills effectively.

T1  - Does learning from giving feedback depend on the product being reviewed: Concept maps or answers to test questions?
AN  - 2814960176; 2022-46664-002
AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a valuable learning experience for a feedback provider. However, different types of products require different types of feedback, which, in turn, may lead to different learning outcomes. The current study investigates the effect on the learning of feedback providers of reviewing different types of products. Secondary school students (n = 127) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: giving peer feedback on either concept maps or answers to open-ended test questions. Both types of product, created by the researchers, were comparable with regard to content: they included the same misconceptions and were both of average quality. Giving peer feedback was part of a chemistry lesson delivered in an online inquiry learning environment. Students’ post-test scores, their own learning products, and the quality of the provided feedback were analysed to check for an effect on learning. There was no difference in post-test scores between the conditions, but the quality of the provided feedback predicted post-test scores. This indicates that it is not the type of product reviewed that matters, but the effort that students put into giving feedback. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept mapping in computer-supported learning environments: A bibliometric analysis
AN  - 2634062596; 2022-39946-001
AB  - ABSTRACT Concept mapping (CM) is widely used in educational settings as a teaching/learning or assessment tool. We conducted a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to provide an updated review on CM research in computer-supported learning environments. A total of 356 selected studies published from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed from the Web of Science database. The findings revealed an increasing and continuous focus on CM research. The leading journal for publishing CM research was Computers & Education, and the United States was the country with the most published studies. The most frequently used keywords were categorized into four clusters to represent the four main themes of CM research. Subsequent analysis showed that the most applied learning subject was environmental science or natural science; traditional computers/devices were the most used devices/hardware; higher education students were the most used samples; quantitative methods were the most used research methods; computers as mindtools were the most adopted learning strategy; and concept mapping assessment was the most used measurement tool in the CM research. These findings reveal the trends of CM research and provide future research directions and applications of practical education for researchers and educators.

T1  - Belonging in science: Democratic pedagogies for cross-cultural PhD supervision
AN  - 2893931702; 2023-56146-044
AB  - This research used Novakian concept mapping and interview techniques to track changes in knowledge and understanding amongst students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards a laboratory science-based PhD. This detailed longitudinal case study analysis measures both cognitive change in the specific subjects that are the topic for research, and the understanding of the process of PhD level research and supervision. The data show the challenges for students and supervisors from different national, ethnic, cultural, and academic backgrounds and traditions with a focus on how this impacts the PhD research process and development. Working cross-culturally, and often in a setting different from either the student or the supervisor’s background and training, can lead to a lack of common language and understanding for the development of a pedagogically oriented supervisory relationship. Documenting change in knowledge and understanding among PhD students and their supervisors is key to surfacing what the joint processes of mutual democratic research and of supervision may entail. This study explores how one of these key processes is a student’s developing sense of belonging (or non-belonging). Specifically, this paper engages the concepts of belonging, and democratic education through mutual learning, to explore the practices of working across national, cultural, ethnic, and diverse academic backgrounds, for both supervisors and students. Doctoral study is understood as a situated context in which belonging also acts as a gateway for who can join the global scientific community.

T1  - Roles, applications, and trends of concept map-supported learning: A systematic review and bibliometric analysis of publications from 1992 to 2020 in selected educational technology journals
AN  - 2621323983; 2022-25288-001
AB  - ABSTRACT This study investigates the roles, applications, and trends of concept map-supported education (CMSE) by reviewing the studies published from 1992 to 2020. Several dimensions, such as the media of concept maps, roles of concepts, sample groups, research methods, application domains, learning contexts, research foci, as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account based on the technology-based learning model. From the review results, two thematic clusters were found, namely concept map-facilitated knowledge construction in collaborative learning, and concept map-based learning design to improve learning achievement and motivation. The research focused more on the applications in engineering courses, followed by science and language courses, and potential was also found in arts, business or management, and mathematics. Learning contexts for CMSE are mainly in-class activities, followed by online discussion activities; moreover, it was found that the number of applications in digital game-based learning contexts is increasing. In terms of research foci, more studies investigated learners’ performance, attitude/motivation, and perceptions, while less emphasis was put on developing learners’ skills, higher order thinking, as well as collaboration and communication competences. Accordingly, several suggestions for future research of CMSE are provided as a reference for researchers and policy makers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Facilitating concept map analysis: Generating and evaluating representative general chemistry concept maps with a novel use of Image J, Gephi, JPathfinder, and R
AN  - 2868254547; 2023-92077-004
AB  - Concept maps are powerful tools used to reveal challenges in students’ learning. However, their use introduces complexities when a large group of students’ conceptualizations need to be examined. In this study, concept maps of 344 general chemistry students were analyzed after grouping them based on achievement in chemistry, math proficiency, and gender. The analysis was also expanded with the consideration of eccentricity values and the extended chemistry triplet. Although some similarities exist between the map of high-achieving students in chemistry and that of high-performing students in the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT), the calculated eccentricity values show interesting variations. On the other hand, the analysis of the map of the low-performing students in MPT and that of low-achieving students in chemistry revealed no clear patterns of symbolic, macroscopic, and submicroscopic terms. Practical suggestions were included to increase the use of representative maps in different assessment and teaching scenarios. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of enriching two main instructional strategies with concept mapping and problem-solving on senior secondary school students' cognition in chemistry
AN  - 2721718040; 2022-81474-072
AB  - This study investigated the effect of enriching two main instructional methods, guided-discovery and lecture methods with concept mapping and problem-solving on students' cognition in chemistry. A sample of 218 randomly selected secondary school chemistry students were pre-tested to assess their prior knowledge, grouped into four instructional groups (concept mapping and problem-solving in guided, discovery mode (CPG); concept mapping and problem-solving in lecture mode (CPL); guided-discovery, (GD); and lecture (LM) groups taught for eight weeks and post-tested on the topics electrolysis, acid-base reactions and energetics.Five research instruments were used pre-and post instructions to test six hypotheses: Group Embedded Figure Test, (GEFT), the Pre-Achievement Test (PAT); the Students' Attitudinal Test (SAT); the Piagetian Chemical Combination Task (PCCT); a Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT) and a retention test, 2 weeks after treatment to gather data. The pre-test consisted of items on prerequisites to the topics taught in this study. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Comparison of middle school student performance on photograph-based multiple-choice items and text-based multiple-choice items on a State Science Achievement Test
AN  - 2720464367; 2022-81473-234
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how photograph-based life science multiple-choice items influenced Louisiana science students' performance on statewide standardized tests, in comparison with text-based items about the same content. This mixed methodology research study focused primarily on types of multiple-choice items, specifically five matched pairs of multiple-choice items, text-only and same-text with a photograph. For the 2007 LEAP field test, statistics from 11 multiple-choice items were utilized to characterize student performance on photograph-based multiple-choice items. Data from all Louisiana 8th grade students taking Form 3 (n=1130) and Form 4 (n=1182) were analyzed to compare student performance on each item type.Additional case study research was conducted in two schools. Within each school, one 8th grade class was exposed to the 20-Question Model (Wandersee, 2000) (treatment group); the remaining 8th grade classes were not (control group). Questionnaires were given to all 8th grade students at each school which focused on the student's experience when answering the field test questions with a photograph. In addition four eighth-grade students, who were contrasted on gender and on high or low academic performance, were interviewed and asked to co-construct six concept maps related to six different test items used in the study (four with photographs, two without photographs).The analysis of the quantitative data showed a significant difference on the heron item. There was a moderate positive correlation between achievement level and mean number correct on the photograph-based items (rs=.1536). The data show that students performing at low achievement levels benefited from the photograph-based item. The qualitative data analysis revealed positive student perception when working with photographs during classroom instruction and taking assessments. The student interviews and concept maps with the four students revealed students' conceptions and misconceptions about life science concepts.

T1  - The impact of whole-plant instruction preservice elementary teachers' understanding of plant science principles
AN  - 2719023643; 2022-81471-299
AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine how an inquiry-based, whole-plant instructional strategy would affect preservice elementary teachers' understanding of plant science principles. This study probed: what preservice teachers know about plant biology concepts before and after instruction, their views of the interrelatedness of plant parts and the environment, how growing a plant affects preservice teachers' understanding, and which types of activity-rich plant themes studies, if any, affect preservice elementary teachers' understandings. The participants in the study were enrolled in two elementary science methods class sections at a state university. Each group was administered a preinstructional test at the beginning of the study. The treatment group participated in inquiry-based activities related to the Principles of Plant Biology (American Society of Plant Biologists, 2001), while the comparison group studied those same concepts through traditional instructional methods. A focus group was formed from the treatment group to participate in co-concept mapping sessions. The participants' understandings were assessed through artifacts from activities, a comparison of pre- and postinstructional tests, and the concept maps generated by the focus group. Results of the research indicated that the whole-plant, inquiry-based instructional strategy can be applied to teach preservice elementary teachers plant biology while modeling the human constructivist approach. The results further indicated that this approach enhanced their understanding of plant science content knowledge, as well as pedagogical knowledge. The results also showed that a whole-plant approach to teaching plant science concepts is an instructional strategy that is feasible for the elementary school. The theoretical framework for this study was Human Constructivist learning theory (Mintzes&Wandersee, 1998). The content knowledge and instructional strategy was informed by the Principles of Plant Biology (American Society of Plant Biologists, 2001) and Botany for the Next Millennium (Botanical Society of America, 1995).

T1  - Comparative investigation of full and focused network feedback on students’ knowledge structure and learning
AN  - 2669604452; 2022-34090-050
AB  - STEM education has an important role in students' learning, and one of the challenges in learning STEM is students' conceptual understanding during the learning process. For example, in many engineering courses, the instructors often employ methods which are predominantly limited to "chalk and talk". This type of hands-off teaching method discourages students' engagement with the topic; therefore, many students' understandings of it are at the surface level. Summary writing is an effective approach for helping learners to integrate and understand the STEM content. In this investigation, the tool Graphical Interface of Knowledge Structure (GIKS) asked students to write a summary essay of lesson content. Next/ Following this, GIKS generated a network map as feedback of the term-term association, which allowed students to reflect on their essay content and structure. This also allowed the instructor to review the essay results simultaneously.In this investigation, knowledge structure referred to an individual's cognitive structure. In the prior pertinent literature, it was also referred to as individual's structural knowledge, conceptual network, conceptual representation, conceptual structure, knowledge organization, and semantic structure. Network maps provided a way to understand knowledge structure and could show the transition of knowledge from novice to expert.Network feedback could serve as a form of structural feedback, a form of feedback that directly intended to alter the structure of term-term associations. This research focused on two types of network feedback: Full network feedback and Focused network feedback. Full network feedback referred to the ordinary view of domain content, while in contrast the Focused network feedback allowed a closer look at a few key sub-branches or specific areas of this content. Ultimately, the Full network map provided the broader understanding of the content knowledge, whereas the Focused network map emphasized the most central and important information. Thus, the difference between Full network map and Focused network map depended on whether the Focus located on the overall domain or a key sub-branch of the content.The research questions in this dissertation included:• Which network feedback leads to a better novice/student's learning performance?• Will students use and value this approach?• What is the influence of students' achievement goal orientation in this structural feedback approach?In order to investigate and respond to the research questions, the learning performance of students in an engineering course using GIKS, who were randomly assigned to receive either Full network feedback or Focused network feedback, were compared. The control group was Full network feedback and the experimental group was the Focused network feedback. Participants' knowledge structure was measured at three times. Findings indicated that Focused network feedback relative to Full network feedback had a significant impact on individual's knowledge structure (KS) improvement in 45 days after the treatment.

T1  - Improving elementary grade students’ science and social studies vocabulary knowledge depth, reading comprehension, and argumentative writing: A conceptual replication
AN  - 2509685694; 2021-34904-001
AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students’ vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students’ vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes.

T1  - Self-descriptions of high-performing and regular-performing primary school students: An open, exploratory study
AN  - 2734693506; 2022-00981-005
AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question “Who am I?,” was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom.

T1  - Giving feedback on peers’ concept maps as a learning experience: Does quality of reviewed concept maps matter?
AN  - 2577759591; 2021-90139-001
AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a powerful learning tool because of the feedback provider’s active cognitive involvement with the products to be reviewed. The quality of peers’ products is naturally an important factor that might influence not only the quality of the feedback that is given, but also the learning arising from this process. This experimental study investigated the effect of the level of quality of the reviewed product on the knowledge acquisition of feedback providers, as well as the role of prior knowledge in this. Dutch secondary-school students (n = 77) were assigned to one of three conditions, which varied in the quality of the learning products (concept maps) on which students had to give feedback while working in an online physics inquiry learning environment. Post-test knowledge scores, the quality of students’ own concept maps and the quality of the feedback given were analyzed to determine any effect of condition on the learning of feedback providers. Students providing feedback on the lower-quality concept maps gave better feedback and had higher post-test scores. There was no interaction with level of prior knowledge. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Effects of strategy training and elaboration vs. retrieval settings on learning of cell biology using concept mapping
AN  - 2800229509; 2023-25435-023
AB  - Concept mapping (CM) can be an effective strategy to facilitate understanding-based learning of complex and abstract scientific content. In our study, we tried to answer two questions that have not yet been clarified: (1) How effective is CM if the learners do not have the textual learning material available when constructing their concept maps (retrieval setting) in contrast to when the material is available (elaboration setting)? (2) Do potential effects of the two settings depend on the intensity of a previous CM strategy training? To this end, we established a quasi-experimental four-group plan and collected data of 
N = 93 undergraduate students. The participants received either a detailed CM strategy training or just a short introduction and were then asked to apply CM in a retrieval or elaboration setting. The quality of constructed concept maps and content-related learning success were assessed to determine potential group differences. Overall, our results show a significantly positive but setting-independent effect of the CM strategy training on methodical CM skills. However, the different setting conditions differed neither regarding concept map quality nor content-related learning success, implying that CM in retrieval settings could be as effective as in elaboration settings.

T1  - Promoting children's inquiry performances in alternate reality games: A mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach
AN  - 2726481125; 2021-76842-012
AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry‐based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game‐based inquiry‐based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem‐solving performances.

T1  - How is clinical credibility defined in nursing? A concept mapping study
AN  - 2477700757; 2021-07096-001
AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of ‘clinical credibility’ in nursing science. Methods: This is stage 2 of a registered report. Concept mapping methodology, 1. Preparation, 2. Generation of statements (brainstorming), 3. Structuring of statements (prioritising/clustering), 4. Representation of statements, 5. Interpretation of maps and 6. Utilisation of maps were used. Part 1 of our registered report followed the required items on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. Part 2 was reporting the results of our study adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines. Results: Participants (
n = 67) from three stakeholder groups participated in this study. Nursing students (
n = 23), nurses and other healthcare professionals (
n = 23), and patients (within the last 12 months) (
n = 21). Participants (
n = 62) generated statements (
n = 429) in response to the question: ‘What does clinical credibility mean to you?’. Following statement reduction, participants (
n = 61) prioritised and clustered (
n = 80) statements. The data were analysed using the concept mapping software, Ariadne. A visual ‘concept map’ was produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by all participants. The final concept map had nine clusters. In order of importance these are as follows: 1. Safe practice, 2. Communication, 3. Patient‐centred care, 4. Accountable, 5. Professional practice, 6. Clinical competence, 7. Teaching attributes, 8. Contemporary expert and 9. Leadership. This study was undertaken over an eight‐month period. Conclusion: Clinical credibility is not necessarily about contemporary clinical practice. It is a multidimensional construct of which current clinical practice is one element. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - How is clinical credibility defined in nursing? Protocol for a concept mapping study
AN  - 2385381896; 2020-23170-001
AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science. Background: In both academic and clinical settings, the phrase “clinical credibility” is used when discussing the education of health professionals. No clear definition for the concept is evident in the academic literature. To date, there has not been a study undertaken to develop a working definition of clinical credibility in nursing science. Methods: This protocol is stage 1 of a registered report. We will use concept mapping to compare and organise views of three stakeholder groups: nursing students (
n = 20) from years 2 or 3 of a three‐year Bachelor of Nursing Programme, nurses and other health professionals (
n = 20) still practising within a clinical setting, and people who have recently been inpatients in hospital (
n = 20). First, participants will take part in separate stakeholder focus groups to generate statements about “What is clinical credibility?”. Second, the same participants will complete two tasks: (1) rank the importance of each statement (prioritising) and (2) put the statements that appear to go together into groups (clustering). The data will then be analysed using a specialised software program called Ariadne. A visual “concept map” will be produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by the participants. The projected timeline for the study is one year. The paper complies with the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines for study protocols adapted for mixed methods research. Conclusion: The findings of this study will provide a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings can be used to develop a measure of clinical credibility to predict student satisfaction and patient safety outcomes.

T1  - Comprehension-oriented learning of cell biology: Do different training conditions affect students’ learning success differentially?
AN  - 2830924419; 2023-20207-006
AB  - Concept Mapping (CM) is a learning strategy to organize and understand complex relationships, which are particularly characteristic of the natural science subjects. Previous research has already shown that constructing concept maps can promote students’ meaningful learning in terms of deeper knowledge and its more flexible use. While researchers generally agree that students need to practice using CM successfully for learning, key parameters of effective CM training (e.g., content, structure, and duration) remain controversial. This desideratum is taken up by our study, in which three different training approaches were evaluated: a CM training with scaffolding and feedback vs. a CM training without additional elements vs. a non-CM control training. In a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learning outcome of 
N = 73 university students who each had participated in one of the trainings before. Our results suggest that an extensive CM training with scaffolding and feedback is most appropriate to promote both CM competence and acquisition of knowledge. From an educational perspective, it would therefore be advisable to accept the time-consuming process of intensive practice of CM in order to enable students to adequately use of the strategy and thus facilitate meaningful learning in terms of achieving sustained learning success.

T1  - Muslims and mental health services: A concept map and a theoretical framework
AN  - 2551710042; 2021-64256-001
AB  - Muslim populations in Western countries are growing, and they face biopsychosocial, spiritual, and economic challenges. Although Islam gives utmost attention to mental health stability, Muslims tend to underutilize mental health services. Mental health professionals, whether they be researchers, practitioners, or trainers working in schools, colleges/universities, mental health agencies, and research institutions, are well positioned to serve Muslims. Mental health professionals can address Muslims’ biopsychosocial and spiritual issues and enhance their quality of life. In the current study, as the authors, we (a) reviewed 300 peer-reviewed manuscripts on Muslim mental health to understand how researchers have used concept maps or theoretical frameworks to design their empirical research, (b) prepared a comprehensive concept map based on the literature review to determine the central concepts affecting Muslims’ approach to the use of mental health services, and (c) proposed a contextual theoretical (conceptual) framework. We titled the framework as Muslims’ approach to use of mental health services based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TPB/TRA) in the context of a Social Ecological Model (SEM). We drew the framework based on TPB/TRA, SEM, and the review of Muslim mental health literature (the concept map). The concept map and the framework provide the most important constructs about challenges Muslim’s face when attempting to utilize mental health services. Future researchers can use the concept map and the framework to conduct theoretically and evidence-based grounded empirical research. We provided implications for researchers, practitioners, educators, and social advocates wishing to contribute to service provision to this population.

T1  - Systems Object Framework: A framework for describing students’ depiction of object organisation within systems
AN  - 2689192868; 2021-80411-005
AB  - Developing students’ ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students’ recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students’ thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students’ representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies.

T1  - Comparing and combining retrieval practice and concept mapping
AN  - 2414442852; 2020-43443-001
AB  - Retrieval practice enhances the learning of educational materials, and prior work has shown that practicing retrieval can enhance learning as much as or more than creating concept maps. Few studies have combined retrieval practice with other learning activities, and no prior work has explored whether concept mapping and retrieval practice might produce especially robust effects when the two activities are combined. In two experiments, students studied educational texts and practiced retrieval (by freely recalling the texts), created concept maps, or completed both activities. In the combined-activity condition, students studied and created concept maps prior to practicing retrieval. On a 1-week delayed assessment, practicing retrieval enhanced learning relative to creating concept maps. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping and retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit over retrieval practice without concept mapping, even though students in the combined condition spent substantially more time engaged with the materials than did students in single-activity conditions.

 (Source: journal abstract) Impact statementEducational Impact and Implications Statement—Can students benefit even more from retrieval-based learning if they first learn the material by using an elaborative study activity? To investigate this question, students read educationally relevant biology texts and then practiced retrieval by writing down everything they could remember from the text, constructed concept maps, or constructed a concept map before practicing retrieval. Surprisingly, combining concept mapping with retrieval practice failed to produce any benefit beyond retrieval practice alone, calling the alleged learning benefits of concept mapping into question.

T1  - Giving feedback on peers’ concept maps in an inquiry learning context: The effect of providing assessment criteria
AN  - 2692201231; 2021-48528-008
AB  - Giving and receiving peer feedback is seen as an important vehicle for deep learning. Defining assessment criteria is a first step in giving feedback to peers and can play an important role in feedback providers’ learning. However, there is no consensus about whether it is better to ask students to think about assessment criteria themselves or to provide them with ready-made assessment criteria. The current experimental study aims at answering this question in a secondary school STEM educational context, during a physics lesson in an online inquiry learning environment. As a part of their lesson, participants (
n = 93) had to give feedback on two concept maps, and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions—being provided or not being provided with assessment criteria. Students’ post-test scores, the quality of feedback given, and the quality of students’ own concept maps were analyzed to determine if there was an effect of condition on feedback providers’ learning. Results did not reveal an advantage of one condition over the other in terms of learning gains. Possible implications for practice and directions for further research are discussed.

T1  - School-STEM professionals’ collaboration: A case study on teachers’ conceptions
AN  - 2689192358; 2021-58612-005
AB  - The motivation for the design of this study was to understand the possibility and impact of the involvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals on school STEM education. This involved two stages, with the design of a set of authentic STEM inquiry activities firstly and implementation in primary classrooms secondly. Five teachers from a local primary school, who were making their first attempt in implementing STEM learning with students at senior primary levels, participated in this study. The teachers worked collaboratively with an Environmental Scientist with support from the research team to design authentic STEM activities to solve a problem which is currently affecting the school environment. The study used a qualitative approach with teachers’ pre- and post- concept maps, self-reflections and interviews to capture changes in teachers’ STEM conceptions. The findings showed that “School-STEM Professionals’ Collaboration” had a positive impact on teachers’ conceptions of STEM education and STEM professionals.

T1  - Analyzing student thinking reflected in self-constructed cognitive maps and its influence on inquiry task performance
AN  - 2536556599; 2021-51817-001
AB  - Higher-order thinking is crucial to inquiry learning. It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students’ inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students’ written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Powering up flipped learning: An online learning environment with a concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy
AN  - 2451161131; 2020-77670-001
AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step‐by‐step hints when conducting problem‐posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy‐five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP‐FL), students in Group B used the problem‐posing strategy‐based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP‐FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency.

T1  - The DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) in online learning environments
AN  - 2479749466; 2020-95144-001
AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study with the intention of answering the question: can an intentionally structured online environment stimulate and enhance the processes of mutual interaction and hybridization between digital artefacts and analogic artefacts (books) so as to encourage the development of significant learning in students? This research, carried out in the academic year 2018/2019, involved 183 Italian students enrolled on the bachelor's degree in Primary Education Sciences at the University of Salerno attending the course “School experimentation and educational planning”. The data were collected by working out and using an information retrieval questionnaire and four different tests. The virtual interaction space was e-LENA, the Learning Management System of the RIMEDI@ research lab. The experimental results highlight how this methodology, called DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) by the authors, has had effects in terms of reducing study time and improving learning outcomes. The online learning environment stimulated to study in greater detail with a book, with the learner being able to restructure and systematize his own knowledge. The DMRA valorises the active role of the learner during his process of knowledge construction and may have significant implications for educators who would like to use innovative and effective online learning environments to enhance student learning.

T1  - Real-world ethics in palliative care: A systematic review of the ethical challenges reported by specialist palliative care practitioners in their clinical practice
AN  - 2641034381; 2021-20783-005
AB  - Background: Ethical issues arise daily in the delivery of palliative care. Despite much (largely theoretical) literature, evidence from specialist palliative care practitioners about day-to-day ethical challenges has not previously been synthesised. This evidence is crucial to inform education and adequately support staff. Aim: To synthesise the evidence regarding the ethical challenges which specialist palliative care practitioners encounter during clinical practice. Design: Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO registration CRD42018105365). Quality was dual-assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Tabulation, textural description, concept mapping and thematic synthesis were used to develop and present the narrative. Data sources: Seven databases (MEDLINE, Philosopher’s Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched from inception to December 2019 without language limits. Eligible papers reported original research using inductive methods to describe practitioner-reported ethical challenges. Results: A total of 8074 records were screened. Thirteen studies from nine countries were included. Challenges were organised into six themes: application of ethical principles; delivering clinical care; working with families; engaging with institutional structures and values; navigating societal values and expectations; philosophy of palliative care. Challenges related to specific scenarios/contexts rather than the application of general ethical principles, and occurred at all levels (bedside, institution, society, policy). Conclusion: Palliative care practitioners encounter a broad range of contextual ethical challenges, many of which are not represented in palliative care ethics training resources, for example, navigating institutional policies, resource allocation and inter-professional conflict. Findings have implications for supporting ethical practice and training practitioners. The lack of low- and middle- income country data needs addressing.

T1  - Static and interactive concept maps for chemistry learning
AN  - 2405339714; 2020-35611-001
AB  - Over 40 years of research, concept maps have shown that they are beneficial for learning. However, much of this research has been conducted in laboratory settings. Although there are a few studies conducted in the classroom, there is little understanding of the instructional efficacy of using different types of concept maps. In a between-subjects design, the present study investigates the effects of learning chemistry in a large undergraduate classroom with three concept mapping activities: static, fill-in-concepts, and fill-in-labels. Students reviewed a static map or completed a fill-in-the-blank concept map. Results show that students studying static concept maps outperformed those who engaged with the fill-in-the-blank concept maps. Further, prior knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of learning performance. Additional findings show that the accuracy of completing partial concept maps mediates the influence of concept map format on learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Effects of different concept map activities on chemistry learning
AN  - 2393668240; 2020-27862-001
AB  - There is widespread evidence showing that concept maps are effective for learning. However, little is known about the effects of various concept map activities. We conducted an experiment to examine the comparative effectiveness of three concept map activities: (i) translating a complete map to a paragraph format, (ii) filling in concepts in a partial map, and (iii) filling in labels in a partial map. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general chemistry course were randomly assigned to the three groups. Each concept map depicted the relationships between concepts on the topic of reaction enthalpy. Results showed that the map-translation group significantly outperformed the fill-in-concepts and fill-in-labels groups in conceptual understanding indicated by open-ended questions while there were no significant differences among the three groups in conceptual understanding indicated by multiple-choice questions.

T1  - Facilitating knowledge construction in mobile learning contexts: A bi‐directional peer‐assessment approach
AN  - 2627187874; 2021-14386-021
AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real‐world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers’ concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers’ ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi‐directional peer‐assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system can not only increase students’ learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment.

T1  - An examination of preschool teachers' beliefs about early literacy within the context of a transdisciplinary neuroeducation learning framework: An exploratory qualitative case study
AN  - 2571957335; 2021-65615-007
AB  - Teacher beliefs have been shown to be an influential factor in student outcomes in all areas of learning. In light of the persistent achievement gap between White students and students of color, it seems important to study and understand the role of teacher beliefs in public education. This exploratory case study contributes to a deeper understanding of how preschool teachers' beliefs about early literacy are expressed or may evolve within a context of implementing the Neuro-semantic Language Learning Theory, a learning framework integrating neuroscience, Western cognitive psychology, and language acquisition into educational applications. The study design included a sample of three preschool educators and multiple data collection events using a robust variety of elicitation methods, including concept map construction, video-stimulated recall, and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed following Saldaña's first, second, and third cycle coding methods and employed both deductive and inductive approaches. Findings included broader definitions of early literacy by study participants than are noted in the literature and the belief that meaningful learning requires context within social interactions as opposed to skill-based interventions. The most significant finding highlighted the complex and contextualized nature of teacher beliefs, which may be changed through the insertion of cognitive disequilibrium supported by a complex and contextualized system of theoretical translation, professional learning opportunities, ongoing coaching, and believable vicarious experiences. Specific recommendations for professional learning experiences and future research are offered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Dynamic feedback as automated scaffolding to support learners and teachers in guided authentic scientific inquiry settings
AN  - 2544508713; 2021-50282-276
AB  - Guided authentic scientific inquiry activities can give students a clear picture of the nature of science and how its fields operate in practice, but such activities are difficult to do well. Too much structure negates the benefit of open-ended activities and student-led investigation, while too little can result in frustration or unproductive floundering. The inclusion of scaffolds for students as well as teachers in such activities is necessary for their successful implementation. Virtual environments can facilitate open-ended inquiry activities by having built-in scaffolds, such as feedback that reacts dynamically to the actions of learners in real time. However, sparse experimental research exists on how formative feedback can best be deployed to students in open-ended immersive environments compared to more constrained tutoring systems or games. Additionally, these tools and curricula must include support for teachers in the design and implementation process if they are to be used in complex classroom settings. Cutting-edge techniques at the forefront of the educational data mining field are being developed for analyzing student actions in such settings, and interest in these techniques is steadily growing. This dissertation documents a pilot implementation of formative feedback tools embedded in the open-ended virtual world of EcoXPT, an experiential curriculum for learning ecosystems science and scientific inquiry. The efficacy of various types of feedback and methods of deployment to both students and teachers are explored, and student outcomes are compared with data from prior baseline EcoXPT implementations. Compared to students in baseline versions of EcoXPT, groups with access to these feedback tools had larger scientific epistemology gains, when controlling for other factors, and made more complete concept maps. Meaningful sequences of logged actions were identified that correlate positively with outcome measures, and overall trends in feature usage between teachers in the sample were described. Student feedback on the utility of the new feedback features is analyzed, and themes from teacher interviews are described to explore how they used the teacher-facing tools as well as how they saw students reacting to the additional tools.

T1  - Getting to know QM(s): Exploring the actor-networks of quantitative methods across higher education social science subjects
AN  - 2521056776; 2021-27912-091
AB  - In the UK, the need for more quantitatively-skilled citizens and employees has been widely publicised. This skills deficit has prompted a wide range of policy initiatives and academic research into quantitative methods (QM(s)) learning-teaching across all levels of education. Although the academic literature has provided useful insights into the learning-teaching of QM(s), it has overlooked key questions concerning the character of QM(s) across Social Science disciplines and the role of non-human actors. This thesis begins to fill this gap in the literature by adopting Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore the learning-teaching of QM(s) within four Higher Education Social Science subjects. To investigate the actor-networks that QM(s) is comprised of, and located within, an assemblage of methods was used, including: semi-structured interviews, concept mapping, participant observation and document analysis. Together, these methods capture QM(s) across Harvey's (2004) three spaces (abstract, relative, and relational), supplementing ANT's own relational understanding of space(-time). Challenging the passive and singular framings of QM(s), presented within policy initiatives and the literature, here, QM(s) was found to be a character occupying multiple positions of agency, taught content, and locations on participants' concept maps. Within the teaching-learning environments, the construction of QM(s) as linear, fixed and learnt through doing was translated by worksheets and correct answers, producing a characterisation of QM(s) as a passive, linear activity of completing tests. When placed within disciplinary actor-networks, QM(s) was identified as performing a variety of roles: providing patterns/trends; offering reliable answers and predictions; aiding theory testing; and assisting decision-making. However, these positionings were being challenged by new techniques, software, and learning-teaching environments. These findings imply that instead of a focus on differentiating QM(s) knowledge, to successfully integrate QM(s) with disciplinary knowledges attention should be given to QM(s') link to data and theoretical positionings. Overall, this thesis provides an original contribution to knowledge through its adoption of ANT, a theory not before applied to QM(s) learning-teaching research. In doing this, it challenges common assumptions made within the literature to provide new insights into the character of QM(s) and the role of previously overshadowed non-human actors.

T1  - Concept maps as sites of rhetorical invention: Teaching the creative act of synthesis as a cognitive process
AN  - 2512801521; 2021-27919-142
AB  - Synthesis is one of the most cognitively demanding practices novice writers must undertake, and research demonstrates that first-year students' synthesis writing practices result in more knowledge telling rather than knowledge creation and transforming. Pedagogies used to teach synthesis often focus on developing text-building strategies but lack explicit instruction on the more cognitively demanding conceptualizing behavior. To explore alternative pedagogies and heuristics, this study looks beyond composition scholarship to incorporate studies in neuroeducation and rhetoric to define synthesis as an ongoing, generative act of cognitive invention, effectively shifting pedagogical focus from text-centered product to student-centered cognitive processes that inform development of synthesized texts (a product). The methods were designed to explore any effects a visual intervention might have on developing student conceptual awareness and reflective practice over time, and whether that transferred into a final researched essay as knowledge transforming.This small-scale exploratory study applies a mixed-methods, design-based methodology to a semester-long intervention in first-year writing classrooms using digital concept maps (DCMAPs) as an ongoing, student-designed space of visualized concept construction. A Control group applied traditional reading-to-write text-based synthesis instruction and practice, while the Intervention group used DCMAPs to enact a prolonged, visualized and reflective practice of active construction of associations, relationships, and structural knowledge building. The DCMAP platform affordances positioned students as knowledge designers enacting creative/constructive processes, an approach based on neuroscience research on patterning and visualization. Intervention data includes reflective journals, narrated mapping process reflections, digital concept map images and construction processes, and a final researched essay that required synthesis of source ideas. Because of the exploratory nature of the study, results are not framed as cause-effect but as correlational possibilities that suggest inventional acts of visually creating connections and labeling them using rhetorically-based associational concepts lead to generative learning behaviors. Results suggest a number of possibilities for future iterations and research, as well as implications for our field's approach to the teaching of synthesis.

T1  - Continuities and discontinuities in factors contributing to science achievement
AN  - 2486190149; 2020-97490-200
AB  - The discipline of chemistry remains a challenge for many college students interested in pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) disciplines and related professions, particularly underrepresented minority (URM) students. Higher numbers of URM students are entering college with aspirations of pursuing science disciplines now than any time in the past decade. However, the disparity between URM students interested in pursuing science and URM students' matriculation rates is considerable. This is especially important in high-stakes "gatekeeper" courses such as introductory organic chemistry because this course is a requirement for a majority of science degrees and has led students, especially minority students, to question their ability to succeed in science.This dissertation examines two competing perspectives – continuities and discontinuities in learning – that have been used to explain students' differential academic achievement. More specifically, these perspectives are examined with respect to important factors like problem solving, conceptual understanding, and study activity behaviors that are related with students' course performance. To date, no study has examined both perspectives simultaneously with respect to important cognitive and behavioral factors.A total of 90 first-semester organic chemistry students attending Golden Gate State University (pseudonym) were recruited for this study. Students were required to attend a total of 4 semi-structured interviews that covered key units throughout the semester. Each interview consisted of completing a concept mapping exercise, a problem set while thinking out loud, and a week-long daily study diary.Concept map proposition scores and problem set scores revealed a main effect of ethnicity that was associated with prior science GPA. In contrast, neither concept map structure nor study strategy was related to a student's ethnic group affiliation. In solving problems, students predominately used 4 common strategies (Forward-working, Means-end, Trial-and-error, and Guessing) to solve problems. Differences were associated with students' prior achievement level (High or Low). Finally, investigation of study strategies showed that all students, regardless of ethnicity, predominantly engage in 4 commonly used study strategies.Results overwhelmingly support the continuity perspective indicating that students' performance on key outcomes are attributable to prior learning, not ethnic group affiliation. These findings underscore the importance of providing access to quality science learning opportunities and resources that aid in developing students understanding. In addition, the finding that students' predominately use reviewing strategies in isolation when studying for organic chemistry highlight the importance of developing workshops and tutorials that encourage students to engage in active peer-learning strategies such as seeking help from peers or goal setting activities.Findings from this study are expected to lead to the design of randomized trial studies involving individualized versus group study strategies and performance on conceptual understanding and problem solving measures. Ultimately, the goal of this line of research is to inform the restructuring of organic chemistry teaching and learning methods in order to close potential gaps in student knowledge. Furthermore, the information obtained from these analyses is expected to be of importance to the prevention of student attrition in STEM courses and the encouragement of enrollment of underrepresented groups.

T1  - Counselor education doctoral students’ research self-efficacy: A concept mapping approach
AN  - 2479750210; 2020-86254-151
AB  - Research self-efficacy (RSE) is a key concept not only for counselor educators as successful researchers but also for the advancement of counselor education field. In the literature, researchers have studied multiple factors (e.g., research interest, productivity) to understand the complex nature of RSE phenomenon. Despite being informative, these studies only focused on partial aspects of the multilayered RSE, showing methodological and conceptual limitations. Particularly, we do not have a holistic understanding of RSE and the interrelated relationship among the factors informing RSE. In the current study, the researcher used a mixed-methods design, Concept Mapping (Kane & Trochim, 2007) to explore the factors influencing counselor education doctoral students' RSE in CACREP-accredited doctoral programs. Current study findings yielded 17 clusters represented in six regions describing the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and systemic levels of Ecological Model (McLeroy et al., 1988). The researcher discussed the findings in the view of the current literature along with implications for researcher training and future research practices as well as with the limitations of current study.

T1  - A qualitative study of visualization skills used to understand chemical bonding theories
AN  - 2435562154; 2020-58776-276
AB  - Visualization skills and spatial ability are necessary for understanding the 3-dimensional shapes of molecules using Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, hybrid orbital theory and understanding of sigma and pi bonding. Much research has been completed on visualization skills and alternative conceptions in chemistry education but there has been little focus on studying these skills for understanding of bonding theory in college chemistry. The aim of this study is to acquire an understanding of how community college chemistry students visualize in 3D and to collect feedback on their experiences of learning in order to provide information for better assessment tools and teaching strategies.The method in this study involved interviewing 15 community college students who were either in the second semester of General Chemistry or taking Organic Chemistry. Data were transcribed and analyzed in conjunction with drawings and molecular models that were constructed and coded for recurring themes and concept understanding. It was found that most participants had a good understanding of molecular polarity and could use VSEPR theory to get the correct shape. Some found that using the Cartesian coordinate axis as a guide helped them to translate between the 2D Lewis structure and the 3D shape. Many had difficulty understanding symmetry, expressing 3-dimensionality in their drawings, determining expanded octet shapes, understanding hybrid orbital theory and understanding how the sigma and pi bonds form. Some of the recurring themes that emerged were the 'value of using models', a 'disconnect' between concepts, a lack of adequate 'time' spent on certain topics and the need to teach the requisite 'terminology'. Some novel alternative conceptions were identified. These include associating the unhybridized p-orbital with a lone electron pair, associating the pi bond with the p-orbital and the sigma bond with the s-orbital, associating the bond type with the hybridization, considering molecules with partial symmetry as symmetrical and the identification of a sigma bond as a single bond and a pi bond as a double or triple bond. Other alternative conceptions identified were consistent with what was found in the literature. Novel recommendations were made on how to address these alternative conceptions and the student concerns that were expressed. Additionally, several concept maps were generated to outline how bonding theories could be learned in a series of steps to solve problems involving 3D structures in chemistry in order to minimize the development of alternative conceptions.

T1  - Uncovering and comparing academics’ views of teaching using the pedagogic frailty model as a tool: A case study in science education
AN  - 2621323894; 2020-86914-004
AB  - Background: One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. Purpose: This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics’ teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Method: Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Findings and Discussion: Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics’ conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

AN  - 2574434829; 2020-52751-007
AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: 
unknown, maybe, probably, definitely, and 
wow. The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t(41), 
p > .38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept maps as assessments of expertise: Understanding of the complexity and interrelationships of concepts in science
AN  - 2574433652; 2020-52751-005
AB  - Concept maps were created as one of six measures to identify exceptionally talented students during the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM (CDTIS) project, with the goal of identifying and nurturing talents in students from groups traditionally underrepresented in special programs. New methods were compared with conventional methods to select students for an internship in the laboratories of scientists. In this article, we describe development, field testing, and implementation of the concept map assessments in life and physical science. Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts.

T1  - Identifying exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics: Increasing diversity and assessing creative problem-solving
AN  - 2574430749; 2020-52751-002
AB  - In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving. Studies of the usefulness and psychometric properties of the new assessments are needed with different groups and in different contexts. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using group concept mapping to develop a conceptual model of housing and community-based residential settings for adults with severe mental illness
AN  - 2756717140; 2020-49833-001
AB  - Background: Most existing conceptual models of residential environments and housing programs were developed over a decade ago or lack comprehensiveness. The attributes to be used to describe housing programs with adequate specification remain unclear including the attributes that mediate service user outcomes. In this study, group concept mapping was used to develop a conceptual model of housing and community-based residential settings for adults with severe mental illness based on stakeholder perceptions and values. Methods: Participants were selected through purposive sampling and included service users, family members, staff working in residential facilities, mental health workers and managers. Participants (
n = 221) generated 1,382 statements describing attributes of housing and community-based residential settings for adults with severe mental illness (99% saturation). Thematic content analysis was conducted to analyze the statements and create a list of 140 selected statements. Participants then rated (
n = 416) and sorted into categories (
n = 73) the selected statements. Descriptive statistics were computed for each statement relative importance. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to produce the conceptual model (maps). Stakeholders (
n = 12) were also involved in the interpretation of the maps. Results: The findings show overall concordance between stakeholders in relation to statements perceived importance (rating) and the statements inter-relationships (sorting). The stress value of 0.23 indicates that the two-dimensional solution of the multidimensional scaling analysis fits the data set (goodness of fit). The final conceptualization includes 12 clusters: (1) A balanced and healthy housing system; (2) Quality and management practices (facility/local level); (3) Physical external environment; (4) Services tailored to needs and preferences; (5) Services and interventions provided (linkage); (6) Equality, policies and availability of activities; (7) Organizational structure and staff qualities; (8) Services and interventions (learning skills); (9) Services and interventions (daily living support); (10) Personal space and right to privacy; (11) Physical interior environment; (12) Respect, functioning and atmosphere. Conclusion: The results illustrate the multifaceted and multilevel nature of community-based residential settings through a visual representation. They articulate a number of attributes, clusters and dimensions that could be included in a common conceptual model of community-based residential settings and housing for adults with severe mental illness.

T1  - Using a concept map with RECALL to increase the comprehension of science texts for children with autism
AN  - 2568287180; 2020-33208-003
AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today’s schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants’ correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Effects of a multi-level concept mapping-based question-posing approach on students’ ubiquitous learning performance and perceptions
AN  - 2400598348; 2020-12774-001
AB  - The literature indicates that the use of mobile devices, wireless communication and sensing techniques can enhance students' learning in authentic environments and improve their learning effectiveness. Good learning strategy guides are essential for successful inquiry learning, and the question-posing strategy has been acknowledged as a type of high-level cognitive strategy that plays an important role in facilitating students' knowledge integration in the inquiry learning process. However, question posing seems challenging for many students and may lead to heavy cognitive load when appropriate scaffolding is not available. To solve this problem, the present research imported a concept mapping knowledge representation model as an auxiliary strategy for question-posing activities based on the research finding that visual knowledge representations are conducive to high-order thinking. It also developed a ubiquitous learning system which integrated multilevel concept mapping and question-posing strategy guidance to investigate the application effects of this learning model. A quasi-experimental design was applied, and an experiment was conducted to measure 5th graders’ learning of a plant unit of the natural science curriculum. Students in the experimental group learned with the proposed ubiquitous learning system based on the multilevel concept mapping and question-posing approach, while those in the control group learned with the ubiquitous learning system based on the question-posing approach. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group from the perspectives of learning achievement and question-posing performance, but no significance was found in their cognitive load, meta-cognitive awareness, and science learning strategies.

T1  - Investigating grade-12 students’ cognitive structures about the atomic structure: A content analysis of student concept maps
AN  - 2528221277; 2020-46952-006
AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal-by using the concept mapping tool-the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students’ concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept mapping in the age of Deleuze: Fresh perspectives and new challenges
AN  - 2519387916; 2020-59639-003
AB  - This conceptual paper offers a reconsideration of the application of Novakian concept mapping to higher education research by putting to work the Deleuzian concept of the rhizome. We ask: what does thinking with Deleuze’s concepts offer researchers interested in concept mapping, and what conceptual, and terminological, obstacles might be created through such a reconceptualization? We have focused on the rhizomatic principles of mapping and tracing in the context of concept mapping. We contend that Deleuze offers a fresh line of flight with the potential to deterritorialise the discourse surrounding concept mapping, thus widening its applicability and increasing its accessibility to researchers who do not necessarily share the same arborescent concept mapping heritage: with its roots in science education. Exploring the overlap between rhizomatics and concept mapping also allows for the reappraisal and blurring of the boundary between structural and post-structural discourses—breaking down an unproductive binary in the literature.

T1  - Exploring student information problem solving behaviour using fine-grained concept map and search tool data
AN  - 2399399962; 2019-78735-001
AB  - For learners to be successful in an information problem solving task, they should be able to effectively regulate their own behaviour. Despite views that such behaviour may come naturally to an individual, research generally shows that some learners do experience problems with information problem solving that may stem from such things as limited prior knowledge. As a means of addressing this challenge, the authors explored how the provision of both a concept map and search tool could overcome barriers to effective information problem solving. This was explored in the current study using data collected from 111 undergraduate students who completed an information problem solving activity, wherein a concept map and search tool were provided to help them write two short essays. Through the use of event-sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, two information problem solving strategy groups were identified (High Engagement and Low Engagement), which differed across time-on-task and essay grades. Additional analyses were undertaken to explore self-reported prior knowledge or motivation as predictors of group assignment. The findings show that even when presented with opportunities (i.e., concept map) to support effective information problem solving, not all learners will take advantage or glean the benefits of such tools. Trace data methodology is shown to be a promising approach to explore information problem solving behaviour that can overcome the limitations of solely relying upon self-report measures.

T1  - Lifelong learning and the structure of professionals' thinking, on the example of case conceptualisation
AN  - 2541907395; 2020-33081-005
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the elements of psychotherapists’ informal education and features of concept maps reflecting the properties of thinking structure. Design/methodology/approach: To study the structure of professional thinking, a complex diagnostic task (computer-aided conceptual mapping task) was used. The diagnostic task consisted of categorising the client’s statements, presenting relations between the categories and concept maps accounting for problems reported by the client and contributing factors and links between them. Findings: The obtained results showed that self-education, through participation in scientific conferences and attending training courses, was significantly associated with the number of perceived causal relationships between categories and the number of perceived reciprocal links between conceptual categories. Originality/value: This research show factors which may contribute to more reliable case conceptualisation in psychotherapy. The method used to measure integrative complexity was original.

T1  - The role of social media applications and hook-up culture among black college-aged men who have sex with (MSM): Examining health outcomes
AN  - 2376304149; 2020-04047-212
AB  - BACKGROUND: The changing nature of sexual hookup encounters has marked an unprecedented shift in sexual norms. There have been a plethora of studies that examine the prevalence of hook- up encounters and the devastating physiological, emotional, and sexual health effects among college-aged gay black men.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine the role of hooking up using social media applications such as Jack'd, Grindr, and Tinder and the role they play in sexual health outcomes among college-aged black men who have sex with men (MSM). Special attention will focus on hook-up culture among black college-aged MSM. Barriers and areas of opportunity for health promotion activities and improved outcomes among this understudied population were examined and will be used to improve health outcomes among this priority population. METHODS: This study used qualitative research methods to collect information about hook-up culture among black college-aged men who have sex with men (MSM). Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with black gay and MSM participants in Florida. A grounded theory approach was used to theory-build, rather than theory-test. Data were transcribed and analyzed using QSR NVIVO™ 12 plus. The transcripts were reviewed by two individuals to ensure the maintenance of inter-rater reliability and validity during the coding process. Codes and themes were gathered from all interviews and concept mapped to formulate a model. RESULTS: Results of this study depict the intricate nature of using social media apps such as Jackd, Grindr, and Tinder among gay black men. Six themes emerged shedding light on the complexities of hook-up culture, and social media applications. A model was formulated specifying several aspects of the interwoven connection between overall hook-up experiences, which are determined by positive or negative experiences. These experiences affect the perception of hook-up experiences, psychological aspects of hooking up, and sexual risk-taking during hook-up encounters.CONCLUSION: Using a grounded theory approach allowed for an understanding of hook-up experiences among gay black men and factors that influence these experiences. Understanding hook-up culture among gay black men could aid in the development of interventions that take into account the myriad of issues black gay men faces while using these applications.

T1  - The impact of a science fair on high school students’ feelings of self-efficacy in STEM
AN  - 2348277095; 2019-68369-139
AB  - The purpose of this present action research study was to describe secondary students' feelings of self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Through a curriculum linked to a science fair project, the teacher-researcher focused on student-participants' perceptions of perseverance and task completion linked to STEM courses and postsecondary STEM careers. A Likert scale pretest (n=44) and posttest (n=33) based on Bandura's model of four categories of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experiences, verbal/social persuasion, and emotional/psychological states) was administered to middle to low income students at a high school in Pennsylvania in the fall of 2018.). Data was also collected data through semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, teacher journal entries, observational field notes, and concept maps. Findings revealed that there was a 3.19% decrease across the cumulative average of all participants in STEM self-efficacy, and a 0.25% increase in the cumulative average of the economically disadvantaged group. Three domains were measured in this action research: social, academic, and emotional. For the social domain, there was a 0.84% decrease in scores across the entire population, with scores of 33.75 on the pretest and 33.47 on the posttest. Within this domain, average scores for the economically disadvantaged population increased by 5.81% pretest to posttest from 33.83 to 35.8, respectively. Academic domain scores decreased by 3.27 %, from 33.18 pretest to 32.10 postest. In the same domain, economically disadvantaged students decreased from 3.61%, from 33.75 pretest to 33.54 posttest. Lastly, emotional scores dropped 5.99% among the entire population, from 31.09 pretest to 29.23 posttest and emotional scores in the economically disadvantaged decreased by 4.79%, from 30.25 pretest to 28.8 posttest. This data was polyangulated through semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, teacher journal entries, observational field notes, and concept maps. To improve participation of economically disadvantaged students in STEM science fairs, an action plan of researching, developing, and sharing strategies for self-efficacy in learners will be developed. This data is helpful as it provided a platform for an action plan to be facilitated to improve the Science Fair preparation process to promote STEM self-efficacy.

T1  - "Perceived importance of the fun integration theory’s factors and determinants: A comparison among players, parents, and coaches": Erratum
AN  - 2324970532; 2019-69103-010
AB  - Reports an error in "Perceived importance of the fun integration theory’s factors and determinants: A comparison among players, parents, and coaches" by Amanda J. Visek, Heather Mannix, Avinash Chandran, Sean D. Cleary, Karen McDonnell and Loretta DiPietro (
International Journal of Sports Science & Coaching, 2018[Dec], Vol 13[6], 849-862). In the original article, reference 72 has been cited on page 859 after the following sentence: "Fortunately, the maps generated from concept and mapping studies naturally lend to the development of a measurement tool(s)". Please note that there is no reference 72 and the citation is void. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2018-59466-004). Conceptualized by youth soccer players, parents, and coaches, the fun integration theory’s FUN MAPS identify 11 fun-factors and 81 fun-determinants. The purpose of this study was to conduct a secondary analysis of those data to explore the extent to which the parents (responsible for supporting) and the coaches (tasked with delivering soccer programs) perceived importance of the factors and determinants were congruent with the players’ self-reported importance. We produced pattern-match displays and go-zone displays, which are innovative, visual representations of group comparisons that are unique to concept-mapping methods, to determine the overall consensus between the groups, in addition to identifying exact points of agreement and disagreement. Results indicated congruence between parents and players was extraordinarily high (
r = 0.89–0.93) and significantly more congruent than coaches and players (
r = 0.75–0.84). Results also indicated consensus was significantly lower among adolescent players and coaches (
r = 0.66–0.71) compared to younger players and coaches (
r = 0.77–0.90). Disparities in the perceived importance of specific fun-factors and fun-determinants between groups are discussed. In addition, transformative learning theory is introduced as an immersive approach to developing fun schemas consistent with the youth athletes' fun ethos that will enable coaches to be athlete-centric when creating fun, positive sport experiences for youth.

T1  - Research trends and features of critical thinking studies in e-learning environments: A review
AN  - 2457719763; 2019-31024-009
AB  - This study investigates critical thinking (CT) studies in e-learning settings to provide a comprehensive analysis of CT studies. Research indexed in the Web of Science database which includes major peer-reviewed social sciences citation index journals in the e-learning field from January 2006 to November 2017 was searched for a systematic review and analysis. A total of 42 studies were selected and synthesized. The distribution of publishing years, geographical areas, education sectors, publications, disciplines, research methods, activities, CT measurement instruments, teaching instruction, the CT roles applied in the studies, and the experiment durations were reviewed. The results showed that most CT studies were conducted in nontraditional teaching environments using strategies such as online discussion or concept mapping; the most used quantitative method was the California critical thinking skills test (CCTST), whereas the most frequently adopted qualitative method was the practical inquiry model of cognitive presence (PIMCP). The common method to enhance students’ CT was online synchronous or asynchronous discussion, and the role that CT played in these studies was as a dependent variable for evaluating whether the designed e-learning instruction(s) can cultivate CT. This study concludes that with active learning instruction and experienced tutor facilitation, students’ CT could be enhanced in a variety of e-learning environments.

T1  - Using network science to analyze concept maps of psychology undergraduates
AN  - 2132312371; 2018-56890-001
AB  - Network science is an emerging area of complexity science that uses mathematical techniques to study complex systems and could represent a new way of quantifying and investigating the internal structure of domain‐specific knowledge as approximated by students' concept maps. Students enrolled in introductory psychology constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of a psychology chapter. Concept networks were constructed based on the concept maps generated by students. Network analysis revealed that the structure of concept networks differed across students (i.e., some networks were better connected than others), and network structure significantly predicted quiz scores, such that concept networks with larger average shortest path lengths (a network metric representing the average of the shortest paths between two nodes in a network) were associated with higher quiz scores, after controlling for network size. This paper illustrates how network science techniques can be used to quantify the conceptual structure of a learner's knowledge. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - An empirical study on evolutionary feature selection in intelligent tutors for learning concept detection
AN  - 2027384875; 2018-17124-001
AB  - Concept map mining (CMM) has emerged as a new research area with recent developments in computational intelligence in educational technology. CMM includes the following steps: extracting the learning concepts from educational content, specifying relations among them, and generating a concept map as a result. The purpose of this study was to develop a mechanism using data mining technique to determine the features that characterize a learning concept extracted automatically from a single educational text. The 3 major features that distinguish the real learning concepts from other sequences of strings are detected by using a hybrid system of a feed‐forward neural network and some evolutionary algorithms. Ant colony optimization and genetic algorithm and particle swarm optimization are used as a binary feature selection method. In addition, the aforementioned methods are hybridized to get better accuracy and precision. The performance comparisons with two different state‐of‐the‐art algorithms have been made from the viewpoint of a typical classification problem.

T1  - Finding the intersection of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning: Scope and contributions to stroke rehabilitation
AN  - 2263496186; 2019-36695-001
AB  - Aim: Neural plastic changes are experience and learning dependent, yet exploiting this knowledge to enhance clinical outcomes after stroke is in its infancy. Our aim was to search the available evidence for the core concepts of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning; identify links between these concepts; and identify and review the themes that best characterise the intersection of these three concepts. Methods: We developed a novel approach to identify the common research topics among the three areas: neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning. A concept map was created a 
priori, and separate searches were conducted for each concept. The methodology involved three main phases: data collection and filtering, development of a clinical vocabulary, and the development of an automatic clinical text processing engine to aid the process and identify the unique and common topics. The common themes from the intersection of the three concepts were identified. These were then reviewed, with particular reference to the top 30 articles identified as intersecting these concepts. Results: The search of the three concepts separately yielded 405,636 publications. Publications were filtered to include only human studies, generating 263,751 publications related to the concepts of neuroplasticity (
n = 6,498), stroke recovery (
n = 79,060), and learning (
n = 178,193). A cluster concept map (network graph) was generated from the results; indicating the concept nodes, strength of link between nodes, and the intersection between all three concepts. We identified 23 common themes (topics) and the top 30 articles that best represent the intersecting themes. A time-linked pattern emerged. Discussion and Conclusions: Our novel approach developed for this review allowed the identification of the common themes/topics that intersect the concepts of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning. These may be synthesised to advance a neuroscience-informed approach to stroke rehabilitation. We also identified gaps in available literature using this approach. These may help guide future targeted research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Applications of Pathfinder Network scaling for identifying an optimal use of first language for second language science reading comprehension
AN  - 2350114524; 2019-06575-005
AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n = 245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert’s referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners’ productions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A systematic review of concept mapping-based formative assessment processes in primary and secondary science education
AN  - 2218612314; 2018-64666-004
AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students’ understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Contemplative neuroscience as a gateway to mindfulness: Findings from an educationally framed teacher learning program
AN  - 2007158087; 2018-07571-001
AB  - A growing number of publications have been exploring the possible effects of mindfulness-based interventions on teachers’ well-being and their professional lives. Notwithstanding promising results in this domain, this paper identifies some difficulties involved in introducing teachers to mindfulness and proposes that there may be a need to develop alternative routes by which to expose more teachers to experiences of mindfulness. We report on a mixed method study of a 5-week teacher learning program implemented in an Israeli middle school with 30 teachers, 28 of which were females, with an age range of 29–55. The program was designed to invite teachers into initial experiences with mindfulness without formally engaging in mindfulness practice but rather based on studying education-relevant brain theory through a contemplative pedagogical approach. Outcomes were analyzed quantitatively by comparing collaborative concept maps created by the participants before and after undergoing the program, and qualitatively by analyzing themes extracted from the participants’ discourse. Findings show that the program (a) mobilized teachers from fixed to growth mindsets in regard to their role as educators as reflected in a significant increase in teachers’ beliefs that basic brain abilities are malleable (as extracted from the concept maps, 
p = 0.004), (b) offered them initial experiences of mindfulness, and (c) possibly opened them to consider more direct approaches to mindfulness practice that are offered in mindfulness-based interventions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Does motivation matter?—The relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and enthusiasm and students’ performance
AN  - 2328380212; 2018-60809-001
AB  - Knowledge and motivation of a teacher are two unchallenged, essential characteristics for successful education. Whilst the relevance of teachers’ professional knowledge for successful students’ learning has been studied in a sophisticated manner for years, the meaning of teachers’ motivational orientations for students’ performance still lacks a differentiated consideration. This construct is conceptualized by three domains: (1) self-efficacy, (2) subject-specific enthusiasm, and (3) enthusiasm for teaching the subject. Motivational orientations overall have shown to be relevant predictors of students’ learning. However, there are several dimensions of motivation and their relative importance remains unclear. Our study goes beyond the available findings by considering in detail each of the three domains’ relations to students’ performance. Thus, we aim to further contribute to the clarification of the predictors of students’ performance in school teaching. For this purpose, we conducted a study with 48 biology teachers and their 1036 students. To assess the three domains of teachers’ motivational orientations, we applied paper and pencil tests. Concept maps and paper and pencil tests were used to measure students’ performance. By specifying multilevel structural equation models, we examined the relationship between the domains of teachers’ motivational orientations and the performance of the students. Our results reveal no relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ performance, but a significant positive relationship between the latter and teachers’ subject-specific enthusiasm. Moreover, our results show a positive trend in the relationship between enthusiasm for teaching the subject and students’ performance. The results provide a differentiated picture about the importance of motivational orientations for the characterisation of an effective teacher. We discuss our findings in terms of possible effect mechanisms and their relevance for further research on teacher motivation and the improvement of teacher education programmes.

T1  - Using a three‐dimensional thinking graph to support inquiry learning
AN  - 2012931357; 2018-10263-001
AB  - The use of external representations has a potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially in hypothesis generation and scientific reasoning, which are typical difficulties encountered by students. This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three‐dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group‐based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open‐ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Facilitators and barriers to smoking cessation among minority men using the behavioral-ecological model and Behavior Change Wheel: A concept mapping study
AN  - 2331826197; 2018-54042-001
AB  - Background and aim: Universal smoking cessation strategies are not always successful for minorities, among whom smoking is highly prevalent despite high intention to quit. This study identifies facilitators for smoking cessation, as perceived by minority male smokers, that can inform a culturally appropriate national plan for smoking prevention and cessation. Methods: We conducted in 2013 a three-stage study among Arab minority male current and former smokers (ages 18−64) in Israel, among whom smoking is very high: first, a Concept Mapping (CM) study with 102 and 202 participants in the brainstorming, and sorting and rating phases respectively. Second, we assigned clusters identified in the CM study to contingency levels using the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM). Third, we classified clusters into intervention functions and policies using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW). Findings: The CM study revealed 58 barriers and facilitators for smoking prevention and cessation that were sorted into 11 clusters by the participants. These clusters were analogous to four BEM level contingency of smoking (social, institutional, community and individual). We classified it into two main policy categories, based on the BCW: 1-restructuring the socio-political environment of smoking through affirmative government's policies towards Arab minority in Israel, and 2-developing a culturally appropriate plan for smoking cessation in Arab local authorities including: raising awareness about tobacco hazards; enforcing anti-smoking laws; strengthening community institutional action; providing smoking cessation services; considering raising prices for tobacco products, addressing psychological sources of smoking in Arab men. Conclusions: Our study revealed barriers, facilitators and contingencies of smoking prevention and cessation with two main policy action items among the Arab minority in Israel: changing the sociopolitical environment of smoking, and developing a culturally appropriate smoking prevention and cessation national plan. Our study framework can inform policies and culturally appropriate interventions for smoking prevention and cessation in other minorities. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Supports for deeper learning of inquiry-based ecosystem science in virtual environments—Comparing virtual and physical concept mapping
AN  - 2023035070; 2018-14636-001
AB  - Concept mapping is an important tool used in science learning to help students construct understanding about fundamental concepts and how they are related. The EcoXPT research project has the goal of supporting authentic experiment-based inquiry within an immersive virtual world curriculum for middle school ecosystem science. It builds on prior research with the EcoMUVE curriculum, which includes, as a culminating activity, student teams creating hand-drawn concept maps to represent their hypotheses about the causal relationships in a virtual ecosystem. As part of the initial Design-Based Research phase of EcoXPT, researchers developed a new electronic concept mapping tool which was piloted with the EcoMUVE curriculum. This study looks at differences in concept maps drawn by student teams based on whether they were given access to the new concept-mapping tool. The findings provide insight into the impact of concept map scaffolding choices, and inform the design of future versions of the tool. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Recurring patterns in the development of high school biology students’ system thinking over time
AN  - 1992037072; 2018-03621-001
AB  - The goal of this study was to identify and understand the mental models developed by 67 high school biology students as they learn about the human body as a complex system. Using concept maps, it sought to find an external way of representing how students organize their ideas about the human body system in their minds. We conducted a qualitative analysis of four concept maps created by each student throughout the 3-year learning process, which allowed us to identify that student’s systems thinking skills and the development of those skills over time. The improvement trajectories of the students were defined according to three central characteristics of complex systems: (a) hierarchy, (b) homeostasis and (c) dynamism. A comparative analysis of all of our students’ individual trajectories together revealed four typical learning patterns, each of which reflects a different form of development for systems thinking: “from the structure to the process level”, “from macro to micro level”, “from the cellular level to the organism level,” and “development in complexity of homeostasis mechanisms”. Despite their differences, each of these models developed over time from simpler structures, which evolved as they connected with more complex system aspects, and each indicates advancement in the student’s systems thinking.

T1  - Priming students for whole-class interaction: Using interdependence to support behavioral engagement
AN  - 2031153765; 2018-18348-001
AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student–student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students’ interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (
R² = .05) and supportive interactions (
R² = .16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (
R² = .07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (
R² = .07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (
R² = .28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Examining science teachers’ argumentation in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering
AN  - 2300269002; 2018-29169-005
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills.

T1  - Knowledge organization through multiple representations in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment
AN  - 2066632431; 2018-29086-007
AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners’ knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners’ knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Teaching note—Mapping the science of social work debate: An exercise in doctoral student education
AN  - 2273351747; 2018-56522-020
AB  - A wide range of opinions exist regarding the science of social work, yielding a challenging discourse to navigate in its entirety. Yet understanding the diverse perspectives and contributions is critical for doctoral students of social work. This teaching note describes the use of concept mapping as a pedagogical method employed by a class of doctoral students and their instructor to articulate the various points of view expressed in the recent literature. We begin with a brief overview of concept mapping, followed by a description of our four-stage methodology. This teaching note offers a brief conclusion that remarks on the value of the exercise and its potential in social work education. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Mind maps and network analysis to evaluate conceptualization of complex issues: A case example evaluating systems science workshops for childhood obesity prevention
AN  - 2345613645; 2018-23753-017
AB  - Across disciplines, it is common practice to bring together groups to solve complex problems. Facilitators are often asked to help groups organize information about and better understand the problem in order to develop and prioritize solutions. However, despite existence of several methods to elicit and characterize how individuals and groups think about and conceptualize an issue, many are difficult to implement in practice-based settings where resources such as technology and participant time are limited and research questions shift over time. This paper describes an easy-to-implement diagramming technique for eliciting conceptualization and a flexible network analysis method for characterizing changes in both individual and group conceptualization. We use a case example to illustrate how we used the methods to evaluate African American adolescent’s conceptual understanding of obesity before and after participating in a series of four systems thinking workshops. The methods produced results that were sensitive to changes in conceptualization that were likely driven by the specific activities employed during the workshop sessions. The methods appear strong for capturing salient levels of conceptualization at both individual and collective levels. The paper concludes with a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of the methods and implications for future practice and research.

T1  - Recommendations for obesity prevention among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds: A concept mapping study among scientific and professional experts
AN  - 2271948283; 2018-26278-008
AB  - The present study aimed to enrich the scientific evidence on obesity prevention programmes for adolescents from socio‐economically disadvantaged backgrounds with practice‐based experiences from both scientific and professional experts in the field of youth obesity prevention. We used the participatory method of concept mapping. Two concept mapping sessions were conducted: one with programme coordinators of national/regional obesity prevention programmes across Europe (
n = 8) and one with scientists participating in European obesity prevention projects (
n = 5). Five recommendations were extracted from both concept maps: (1) involve adolescents in the design and delivery of the programme, (2) invest in family/parental capacity building, (3) provide and support a healthy school food and physical activity environment, (4) regulate exposure to unhealthy messages/advertising and (5) facilitate safe and active travel. These recommendations can be used as a conceptual framework for programme development for preventing obesity in adolescents. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Studying and constructing concept maps: A meta-analysis
AN  - 1881317761; 2017-13290-001
AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (
n = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (
g = 0.58, 
p < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (
g = 0.72, 
p < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (
g = 0.43, 
p < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Grim FATE: Learning about systems thinking in an in-depth climate change simulation
AN  - 2273358145; 2018-18052-006
AB  - Background: Simulations of complex systems have a long history of use for the study and promotion of systems thinking, yet more can be done in identifying games that promote development of systems thinking. Aim: This study is an exploration of the hypothesis that FATE OF THE WORLD, a challenging and complex climate change simulation, can promote systems thinking about climate change. Questions: This article analyzes players’ engagement with FATE OF THE WORLD using three key questions: 1. In what ways does the game support thinking about climate change as a complex system? 2. Does the game correspond to players’ a priori model of climate change? 3. How do players relate to FATE as an artifact they embrace, critique, and tinker with? Method: 33 participants were matched into control and test groups, and experimental participants were assigned to play a full game scenario of FATE OF THE WORLD. Experimental and control groups were compared using pre-and-post intervention concept maps. Post interviews were conducted with the test group. Results: Concept maps revealed statistically significant differences between the control and test groups. Interviews revealed diversity in learning outcomes and the ways in which acceptance of the game’s model of climate change influenced learning. Conclusions: FATE serves as proof-of-concept for the power of complex simulations to promote systems thinking as well as in-depth reflection on key social challenges. However, simulations like FATE are unlikely to serve well as stand-alone educational tools, which highlights the importance of effective teaching to accompany the game.

T1  - Conceptualizing trust in community-academic research partnerships using concept mapping approach: A multi-CTSA study
AN  - 1993192621; 2017-54239-010
AB  - Objectives: Collaborations between communities, healthcare practices and academic institutions are a strategy to address health disparities. Trust is critical in the development and maintaining of effective collaborations. The aim of this pilot study was to engage stakeholders in defining determinants of trust in community academic research partnerships and to develop a framework for measuring trust. Methods: The study was conducted by five collaborating National Institute of Health’ Clinical and Translational Sciences Awardees. We used concept mapping to engage three stakeholders: community members, healthcare providers and academicians. We conducted hierarchical cluster analysis to assess the determinants of trust in community-academic research partnerships. Results: A total of 186 participants provided input generating 2,172 items that were consolidated into 125 unique items. A five cluster solution was defined: authentic, effective and transparent communication; mutually respectful and reciprocal relationships; sustainability; committed partnerships; and, communication, credibility and methodology to anticipate and resolve problems. Conclusion: Results from this study contribute to an increasing empirical body of work to better understand and improve the underlying factors that contribute to building and sustaining trust in community academic research partnerships.

T1  - Preservice science teachers’ instructional design competence: Characteristics and correlations
AN  - 2243676348; 2019-00741-033
AB  - Underpinned by a holistic, dynamic, and process-oriented view of teacher competences, this study provides an analytic hierarchy system of instructional design competence (IDC) for evaluating teachers’ IDC based on the mental model of instructional design. Additionally, this study quantitatively explores the IDC characteristics and correlations of 118 preservice science teachers at Shanxi Normal University in China, who learned the ADTRE (analyzing, designing, teaching, revising, and evaluating/improving) instructional model, based on reflection and feedback. Using lesson planning (LP) scoring rubrics, we analyzed 113 lesson plans from 56 participants majoring in biological science and 57 in biological technology. We present the ADTRE model and discuss relationships between preservice science teachers’ academic achievement and IDC. Major findings include a positive correlation between preservice science teachers’ IDC scores and their course grades in Advanced Mathematics and Cell Biology and concept mapping skills. There was a negative correlation between preservice science teachers’ IDC and course grades in Principles of Genetic Engineering and Technology, and no significant correlations existed between IDC and course grades for teacher education courses. Our findings reveal the nature of preservice science teachers’ IDC, a potential for improvement in university teacher education curricula, and a need for further research.

T1  - Variation in the development of teachers’ understandings of assessment and their assessment practices in higher education
AN  - 2135208137; 2017-55564-010
AB  - This paper reports a study into the development of staff understanding of assessment and assessment practice. Eight teachers from two universities constructed an initial concept map about assessment that was discussed in a one-to-one semi-structured interview. A year later, a new map was created and the interview focused on change in thinking and practice. Multiple models of assessment were evident in the participants’ understandings at the same time and change was characterised by subtle evolution in thinking. Development in practice was more significant and often associated with the foregrounding of assessment for learning. Vignettes are used to illustrate the variation in nature and scale of development. Interplay between this development of practice and understanding was multidirectional and external context played an important role. The approach offers detailed insight into the relationship between assessment thinking and practice and demonstrates that both research and academic development need to go beyond conventional approaches to conceptualising the development of academics and take account of the finer grained complexities of assessment thinking and practices.

T1  - The effect of computer science on physics learning in a computational science environment
AN  - 2130901093; 2018-48574-043
AB  - College and high-school students face many difficulties when dealing with physics principles and concepts, such as a lack of understanding of the components of formulas or of the physical relationships between the two sides of the formulas. To overcome these difficulties some instructors suggest combining design of simulations while learning physics, claiming that the programming process forces the students to understand the physical mechanism activating the simulation. The current research investigated the physics learning taking place while programming physics simulations. In particular, it explored how programming and computer science (CS) affect physics learning taking place in a unique context, a computational-science course where the physics learning was not one of the goals of the course thus not extensively addressed. This study examined the physics learning of computational-science students. It reports on findings obtained from the analysis of the discourse of pairs of students while developing computational models of physics phenomena. The following three learning aspects were examined: (a) The physics conceptual understanding achieved by the students. The students' conceptual knowledge in physics was evaluated at the beginning and at the end of developing the models, and at different stages in between. Concept maps (Novak & Canas, 2008) were used to represent the students' knowledge. (b) The effect of CS on the evolution in students' conceptual knowledge in physics was evaluated using the Knowledge Integration (KI) framework (Linn & Eylon, 2006, 2011), which describes four thinking processes that students should undergo to experience meaningful learning. (c) The problem-solving (PS) behaviors employed by the students and the effect of CS on them were evaluated using the Epistemic Games framework (Tuminaro, 2004; Tuminaro & Redish, 2007) which describes coherent activities that are used for creating knowledge or solving a problem. (d) The effect of CS on students' ability to think at different levels of abstraction in physics. The framework of Epistemic Games (Tuminaro, 2004; Tuminaro & Redish, 2007) was used for this purpose as well. Findings revealed that the computational-science students gained physics knowledge that is reported to be difficult for high-school and even undergraduate students. Four different domains that exist in CS were found to trigger physics learning: structural knowledge, procedural knowledge and systemic knowledge that deal with knowledge representation, and the execution domain that enables reflection on the represented knowledge. The computational environment in general, and CS in particular, was most of the time the trigger of the students' application of high-level PS behaviors. In some cases, however, the difficulty of combining physics with CS led the students to apply low-level PS behaviors. Moving between levels of abstraction in CS was found to encourage the students to move between levels of abstraction in physics. The need to develop computational models encouraged the students to apply higher levels of abstraction in physics, mainly during the development and exploration of equations. At the same time, students moved between the higher level of abstraction in CS---developing the interface---and the lower level of activating it as code. In general, CS was found to affect physics learning in both positive and negative ways. It seems that combining CS and physics was difficult for the students, but it was also the catalyst to effective learning. Instructional implications and limitations of the research are discussed.

T1  - Soft matter: Curriculum design of a contemporary, interdisciplinary science course for high school students
AN  - 2130898971; 2018-48574-015
AB  - High school and first year college students usually encounter the concepts and approaches of physics in a traditional curriculum that focuses on simplified systems such as the mechanics of point particles or thermodynamics of ideal gases. Such students rarely have the opportunity to study contemporary, interdisciplinary topics in which physical models are used to analyze complex real-world, interacting multi particle systems. This dissertation describes a design-based research of a curriculum that introduced such an inter-disciplinary topic - the study of soft and biological matter to 11th and 12th grade students. The first part of the dissertation addresses how the topic of soft matter, typically taught in graduate courses, is adapted to the introductory student level. We begin by introducing the fundamental tenet of soft matter systems analysis: the use of microscopic models, such as the lattice-gas, to quantify macroscopic properties utilizing principles of statistical thermodynamics (e.g. free energy minimization). We then describe how we make the topic accessible to students: first, by presenting it in the curriculum as a generic modeling process analyzing diverse phenomena in a unified manner; and second, through instructional activities such as using concept maps for organizing knowledge and troubleshooting tasks to learn from common mistakes. The dissertation continues with two empirical studies that focus on two key aspects of student learning in the program: 1. The evolution in students' use of fundamental principles of statistical thermodynamics (such as the 2 nd law of thermodynamics) as the complexity of the systems that were studied and the level of quantitative analysis has increased. 2. The perceptions of scientific modeling that students acquired as they studied soft matter systems in the lessons and after they participated in independent, inquiry projects. Our analysis of learning in the program is based on authentic classroom data from diagnostic questions, videos of lessons and interviews. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of student learning, and the role of prior knowledge and epistemology in it, we focused on the statements of case study students, whose performances represent common learning pathways in the program. We found that several students believed that phenomena in which the entropy of system decreases, contradict the 2nd law of thermodynamics. We suggest that this deficiency is related to student difficulties in integrating energy related concepts, and to an epistemology that allows fundamental scientific laws to be overridden by others. In addition, we found that many students were inclined to interpret the process of modeling soft matter phenomena as a mathematical procedure and disregarded its simplification aspect which precedes the mathematical derivations. We suggest that the simplification aspect did not sufficiently capture the students attention and was therefore disregarded while the mathematical aspects were naturally difficult and provoked student interest. In addition, this deficiency can be related to student perceptions of modeling as a process of replicating real systems in a mathematical form, which might have rendered approximations and simplifications as undesirable. In the spirit of design-based research, the findings were interpreted in light of the instructional activities and were used to propose strategies to improve instruction in future developments of a similar, interdisciplinary program. In addition, the findings contribute to the understanding of themes such as modeling and statistical thermodynamics that extends beyond the context of this specific design.

T1  - Understanding information search processes in the context of academic literature searches
AN  - 2130898424; 2018-48574-230
AB  - Current search engines and information retrieval systems have made extraordinary progress towards interpreting and answering well-defined, direct questions. However, they are often unsatisfactory for assisting users with less well-defined information needs that often occur within an academic context. Examining students' search goals and search behaviors can provides insight into information search strategies and tactics. Understanding these behaviors can also help inform the design of search systems in order to better present information to users with these types of information needs. This research examines case studies of graduate students conducting academic literature searches. Screen recordings and individually coded interactions were qualitatively analyzed for emergent search behaviors and evolution of goal refinement while searching for information on a broad topic of interest. Student concept maps representing their visual organization of the documents they found were compared to topic maps algorithmically generated from the same documents. Findings from observations of participants' search sessions are distilled into a set of design recommendations for search systems that can be applied to better address the needs of those searching for academic publications and information.

T1  - Concept mapping as an assessment of cognitive load and mental effort in complex problem solving in chemistry
AN  - 2085976521; 2018-30617-038
AB  - This research is an exploratory, descriptive study of students' cognitive load and mental effort related to complex problem solving in high school chemistry. From a cognitive point of view, the complexity associated with problem solving in chemistry can be understood from the context of cognitive load theory (CLT). The objective of this descriptive research using five high school student case studies is to understand the cognitive load phenomena students encounter while learning subject matter that requires complex problem solving, specifically chemical equilibrium. This study employed a mixed methods multiple case study design, in which each participating student (n = 5) is conceptualized as a case. Each student case self-reported their mental effort on eight chemical equilibrium problems. The mean for each students' mental effort and problem solving was reported. Each student completed an equilibrium concept map which was scored. The concept map scores are reported. The analysis compared mental effort score, quiz score and concept map score. There was an inverse relationship between mental effort and concept map score. The more complex the concept map (higher score) the less mental effort students report using to solve the problems. There was a positive relationship between mental effort score and quiz score; and a negative relationship between concept map score and quiz score. We believe these correlations indicate that the variables are related to cognitive load. Methodologically, we found that concept mapping is a valid assessment of cognitive load and mental effort. We believe that further larger studies are needed to substantiate these findings and explain how concept mapping can be used as a representation of cognitive load and student learning.

T1  - In search of three-dimensional learning: Using self-study to change a secondary biology teacher's practice
AN  - 2084059827; 2018-30343-213
AB  - The purpose of this research project was to provide a model for traditional teachers who want to change their practice using self-study research when professional development is unavailable. Issues and tensions that arise when transitioning from a traditionally taught secondary biology unit to a unit that is more in alignment with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are explored. Data collection included using field notes, critical friend's conversations and feedback, video and audio recordings, Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products (EQuIP) rubric unit evaluations, self-study personal history and class portrait, concept maps, tag clouds, and student work. Data analysis compared the changes in practice that occurred between the enactment of a traditionally taught secondary biology unit, and an instructional unit developed by Project NEURON at the University of Illinois. Changes in teacher understanding of the NGSS, classroom dynamics, curricular alignment with the NGSS, and three-dimensional learning are discussed. The self-study concludes that teacher change can occur using in-depth, critical reflections on practice. Traditional teachers who want to transition to the NGSS and three-dimensional instruction can benefit from the findings of this study. Tensions and issues surrounding science education reforms can give valuable insights to science educators in anticipation of the transition to the NGSS.

T1  - Pura vida: Teacher experiences in a science education study abroad course in Costa Rica
AN  - 2042690379; 2018-13258-224
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of classroom teachers who participated in a science-focused study abroad during their time as a preservice teacher and to explore how they are using their study abroad experiences in science curriculum planning and in classroom instruction. This study is guided by two research questions: 1) what are the study abroad experiences that have influenced classroom teachers; and, 2) how do classroom teachers incorporate study abroad experiences into science curriculum planning and instruction in the classroom? Participants were two in-service science teachers from schools located in the Southwestern United States. The participants were enrolled in the course, Environmental Science and Multicultural Experience for K-8 Teachers offered through the Department of Educational Leadership, Curriculum and Instruction during their time as preservice teachers. The course included a two-week study abroad component in Costa Rica. Participants spent their mornings observing a monolingual, Spanish-speaking elementary classroom followed by a faculty-led multicultural seminar. Afternoons during the study abroad experience were dedicated to field science activities such as quantifying plant and animal biodiversity, constructing elevation profiles, determining nutrient storage in soil, and calculating river velocity. Throughout the course students participated in science-focused excursions. A cross case study design was used to answer the two research questions guiding this dissertation study. Data collection included participant-created concept maps of the science experiences during the study abroad experience, in-depth interviews detailing the study abroad experience and classroom instruction, and participant reflective journal entries. Cross-caseanalysis was employed to explore the uniqueness of each participant's experience and commonalities between the cases. Trustworthiness was established by utilizing multiple sources of data, member checking, documenting the process of identifying themes from findings, and peer de-briefing. Four themes emerged via data analysis, they include: (1) experiencing science in Costa Rica, comprised of the categories of facilitated science experiences, collaborative grouping, and science stressors; (2) studying abroad in Costa Rica, containing the categories Costa Rica is your oyster, background of Costa Rica, foreground of Costa Rica, atmosphere of Costa Rica, and Costa Rican culture; (3) transferability of science experiences including the categories disposition of teaching, pedagogical knowledge, what you teach, and for whom you teach; and (4) the multicultural classroom made up of the categories Costa Rican classroom struggles, positive Costa Rican classroom climate, transferability of instructional approaches, and developing cultural competency. Implications for study abroad decision-makers and stakeholders are included. Additionally, recommendations for future research are also described. Preservice science teachers develop their knowledge of science, confidence to teach science, and ability to instruct students in the field of science in a multicultural classroom, as a product of science-focused study abroad opportunities.

T1  - A comparative study of Hawaii middle school science student academic achievement
AN  - 2035593055; 2018-11220-283
AB  - The problem was middle-grade students with specific learning disabilities (SWDs) in reading comprehension perform less well than their peers on standardized assessments. The purpose of this quantitative comparative study was to examine the effect of electronic concept maps on reading comprehension of eighth grade students with SWD reading comprehension in a Hawaii middle school Grade 8 science class on the island of Oahu. The target population consisted of Grade 8 science students for school year 2015--2016. The sampling method was a purposeful sampling with a final sample size of 338 grade 8 science students. De-identified archival records of grade 8 Hawaii standardized science test scores were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS. The finding for hypothesis 1 indicated a significant difference in student achievement between SWDs and SWODs as measured by Hawaii State Assessment (HSA) in science scores (p < 0.05), and for hypothesis 2, a significant difference in instructional modality for SWDs who used concept maps and does who did not as measured by the Hawaii State Assessment in science (p < 0.05). The implications of the findings (a) SWDs performed less well in science achievement than their peers and consequently, and (b) SWODs appeared to remember greater degrees of science knowledge, and answered more questions correctly than SWDs as a result of reading comprehension. Recommendations for practice were for educational leadership and noted: (a) teachers should practice using concept maps with SWDs as a specific reading strategy to support reading comprehension in science classes, (b) involve a strong focus on vocabulary building and concept building during concept map construction because the construction of concept maps sometimes requires frontloading of vocabulary, and (c) model for teachers how concept maps are created and to explain their educational purpose as a tool for learning. Recommendations for future research were to conduct (a) a quantitative comparative study between groups for academic achievement of subtests mean scores of SWDs and SWODs in physical science, earth science, and space science, and (b) a quantitative correlation study to examine relationships and predictive values for academic achievement of SWDs and concept map integration on standardized science assessments.

T1  - Factors that influence parent recruitment into prevention programs in early childhood: A concept map of parents', practitioners', and administrators' points of view
AN  - 2011632564; 2018-05069-016
AB  - Given that parents are the main carriers of change in their child, their participation in programs for preventing behavior problems in early childhood represents a key element in ensuring the success of the intervention. That said, although at-risk families benefit the most from this type of program, they are identified as being hard to reach. This study aims at identifying the factors that influence parent recruitment based on the points of view of the actors concerned. To this end, a concept mapping operation was performed, which involved parents (
n = 19), practitioners (n = 19), and administrators (
n = 13) from community and public organizations. The participants generated 131 statements to complete the following sentence: 
In your opinion, parents would enroll more in prevention activities for their child if…. These 131 statements were classified into 12 groups representing the factors that influence parent recruitment, all of which were considered relatively important (between 3.51 and 4.42 on 5). The participants also agree on an understanding of recruitment that tends toward an ecological model. This study shows that parent recruitment into prevention programs targeting behavior problems in early childhood is complex and multifactorial (including factors that concern parents, practitioners, services, organizations, and policies). Because the map shows that the influencing factors in recruitment appear to be interrelated, they should all be considered to increase the chances of reaching at-risk families.

T1  - Using concept maps to monitor knowledge structure changes in a science classroom
AN  - 2008438252; 2018-00724-164
AB  - The aim of this research is to determine what differences may exist in students' structural knowledge while using a variety of concept mapping assessments. A concept map can be used as an assessment which connects concepts in a knowledge domain. A single assessment may not be powerful enough to establish how students' new knowledge relates to prior knowledge. More research is needed to establish how various aspects of the concept mapping task influence the output of map creation by students. Using multiple concept maps and pre-instruction and post-instruction VNOS instruments during a 16-week semester, this study was designed to investigate the impact of concept map training and the impact of assessment design on the created maps. Also, this study was designed to determine what differences can be observed between expert and novice maps and if similarities and differences exist between concept maps and an open-ended assessment. Participants created individual maps and the maps were analyzed for structural complexity, overall structure, and content. The concept maps were then compared by their timing, design, and scores. The results indicate that concept mapping training does significantly impact the shape and structure complexity of the map created by students. Additionally, these data support that students should be frequently reminded of appropriate concept mapping skills and opportunities so that good mapping skills will be utilized. Changing the assessment design does appear to be able to impact the overall structure and complexity of created maps, while narrowing the content focus of the map does not necessarily restrict the overall structure or the complexity. Furthermore, significant differences in structural complexity were observed between novice and expert mappers. The fluctuations of NOS concepts identified in student created maps may suggest why some students were still confused or had incorrect conceptions of NOS, despite explicit and reflective instruction throughout the semester.

T1  - Using concept maps with simulation: Learning experiences of associate degree in nursing students
AN  - 1990872609; 2017-54454-246
AB  - Graduate nurses have experienced a difficult transition to clinical practice. With the continuing gap in educational preparation and clinical nursing practice leading to errors in health care delivery, the nurse faculty remains challenged in performing innovative changes to the curriculum to improve and maintain quality and safe patient care. The use of simulation and other simulation-based experiences have emerged in nursing education. Research using the simulation with concept mapping has shown promising results in the baccalaureate nursing programs. However, the combined use of concept mapping and simulation is limited in the associate level of nursing programs. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative single case study was to explore the learning experiences of seven nursing students enrolled in the first nursing course from a two-year nursing program at a private college in the New England state. In using the purposeful sampling method, data collection and content analysis originated from the study participants' responses to a field-tested interview protocol. Research questions focused on the learning perspectives of the value in using a concept map with simulation in developing the critical thinking and reasoning skills and the appropriateness as a teaching pedagogy to help translate the knowledge into the clinical practice. Study findings indicated the feeling of uncertainty, confusion, and an overwhelming experience. However, the students found both activities helpful in developing the essential competencies if utilized in the beginning of the first nursing course and consistently across the program. Study findings contribute to an increase awareness of the nurse faculty on the benefits of utilizing a concept map with simulation as teaching pedagogies to learn about the nursing practice. Recommendations for future studies include comparing the learning perspectives with male nursing students and extending the research by following the student progress in the nursing program.

T1  - The engineering design process: Conceptions along the learning-to-teach continuum
AN  - 1952973260; 2017-29360-052
AB  - In this study, I sought to identify differences in the views and understandings of engineering design among individuals along the learning-to-teach continuum. To do so, I conducted a comprehensive review of literature to determine the various aspects of engineering design described in the fields of professional engineering and engineering education. Additionally, I reviewed literature on the methods used in teaching engineering design at the secondary (grade 7-12) level -- to describe the various models used in classrooms, even before the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). Last, I defined four groups along the learning-to-teach continuum: prospective, preservice, and practicing teachers, as well as teacher educators. The context of this study centered around a California public university, including an internship program where undergraduates engaged with practicing mentor teachers in science and engineering teaching at local high schools, and a teacher education program where secondary science preservice teachers and the teacher educators who taught them participated. Interviews were conducted with all participants to gain insights into their views and understandings of engineering design. Prospective and preservice teachers were interviewed multiple times throughout the year and completed concept maps of the engineering design process multiple times as well; practicing teachers and teacher educators were interviewed once. Three levels of analyses were conducted. I identified 30 aspects of engineering discussed by participants. Through phenomenographic methods, I also constructed six conceptual categories for engineering design to organize those aspects most commonly discussed. These categories were combined to demonstrate a participant's view of engineering design (e.g., business focused, human centered, creative, etc.) as well as their complexity of understanding of engineering design overall (the more categories their ideas fit within, the more complex their understanding was thought to be). I found that the most commonly referenced aspects of engineering design were in line with the three main dimensions described in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). I also found that the practicing teacher participants overall conveyed the most complex and integrated understandings of engineering design, with the undergraduate, prospective teachers not far behind. One of the most important factors related to a more integrated understanding of engineering design was having formal engineering experience, especially in the form of conducting engineering research or having been a professional engineer. Further, I found that female participants were more likely than their male counterparts to view engineering as having a human element---recognizing the need to collaborate with others throughout the process and the need to think about the potential user of the product the engineer is solving the problem for. These findings suggest that prior experience with engineering, and not experience in the classroom or with engineering education, tends to lead to a deeper, more authentic view of engineering. Finally, I close with a discussion of the overall findings, limitations of the study, potential implications, and future work. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Becoming STEM teachers: Examining changes in science teachers' conceptual understanding about earthquake engineering
AN  - 1952961485; 2017-29360-005
AB  - This multi-paper dissertation reports results from three related research studies centered on the development and use of an authentic measure, concept mapping, to assess changes in workshop teachers' conceptual understanding of earthquake engineering. My review of the literature indicated few research studies examining how traditionally trained science teachers develop STEM-related understandings about the complex relationships between concepts associated with STEM-related contexts, such as those existing within the context of earthquake engineering. STEM researchers currently know little about how teachers develop deep conceptual understanding of complex and interdisciplinary content knowledge. To address the gap I found in the literature, I designed three studies to: (1) conduct a modified Delphi study to create a list of key concepts as a knowledge base in earthquake engineering, (2) examine changes in science teachers' conceptual understanding of earthquake engineering as a result of their participation to an engineering-oriented teacher professional development (EOTPD), and (3) investigate changes in the quality of science teachers' argumentation discourse after their participation in a week-long EOTPD. Researchers suggest identification of key concepts in critical engineering content areas for high school science teachers to increase their engineering content knowledge. In my first study, I identified and verified key concepts in earthquake engineering necessary for high school learners to acquire a basic understanding of earthquake engineering. Results included a key concepts list and an interdisciplinary strand map with 35 earthquake engineering key concepts in five domains. Furthermore, stakeholders suggest providing opportunities for STEM teachers to improve their conceptual understanding in critical engineering areas within EOTPDs. In my second study, I developed a conceptual framework, Meaningful Conceptual Learning, for successful conceptual understanding of complex and interdisciplinary content knowledge, implemented the framework into an EOTPD on earthquake engineering, used individual and group concept mapping as authentic assessment method. Results indicated science teachers enhanced their conceptual understanding of the earthquake engineering content knowledge after the EOTPD. Stakeholders in science education also emphasize the critical role of using argumentation discourse in teaching science and indicate most science teachers still lack the pedagogical skills to introduce and enhance students' argumentation discourse skills. In my third study, I implemented argumentation discourse with a procedural guideline involving EOTPD participants' reasons for the inclusion of various concepts in their concept maps. I used a modified method for collecting and analyzing discourse data and found significant enhancement in teachers' argumentation discourse levels after the implementation.

T1  - The role of team cognition in collaborative information seeking during team decision-making
AN  - 1946701088; 2017-19720-160
AB  - Team decision-making is a process composed of many activities. One important activity is collaborative information seeking (CIS). CIS takes place when "two or more individuals work together to seek needed information in order to satisfy a goal" (Karunakaran & Reddy, 2012). Consequently, CIS can play an important role in team decision-making. Current CIS research has focused on (1) examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational and other settings and (2) developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. However, most CIS research has overlooked the cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, there is little research examining CIS from a team cognitive perspective. Often, the development of team cognition positively improves the team decision-making process (Cooke et al., 2003). Specifically, the development of team mental models, a team cognitive construct, has often been identified as a way to help teams complete their work (Lim & Klein, 2006). However, the relationship of CIS and team cognition has never fully been explored. In this dissertation, my four main research objectives were to (a) explore how teams approach CIS; (b) develop a conceptual understanding of team cognition during CIS; (c) understand the impact and affect of a co-located and distributed setting on team's CIS approaches and the development of team cognition, and (d) develop design guidelines for information technologies that will support multiple CIS approaches and the development of team cognition during CIS. To meet my research objectives, I conducted two separate qualitative laboratory studies of undergraduate student teams engaged in multiple CIS tasks. The first study focused on co-located, synchronous CIS. In this study, I utilized qualitative methods such as cognitive interviews, observations, and concept mapping to examine how teams approached CIS and to identify if and how team cognition developed during CIS activities. The second study examined teams using a collaborative system in a distributed, synchronous CIS environment. The second study employed cognitive interviewing to investigate CIS approaches and team cognition in the distributed environment. Through these studies, I make contributions to three different research fields---(1) Human Factors, (2) Information Sciences, and (3) Computer Supported Cooperative Work. Specifically, I (1) identify different approaches that teams take to CIS, (2) explain the role and development of team cognition in CIS, and (3) describe how teams approach CIS and develop team cognition in both the co-located and distributed environments. Through this research, I hope to further our empirical understanding of CIS especially in regards to cognition. I also hope to provide some design guidance for the development of more effective CIS tools that account for the role of team cognition. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Conceptualizing in-service secondary school Science teachers' knowledge base for promoting understanding about the science of global climate change
AN  - 1942910518; 2017-19718-268
AB  - Efforts to adapt and mitigate the effects of global climate change (GCC) have been ongoing for the past two decades and have become a major global concern. However, research and practice for promoting climate literacy and understanding about GCC have only recently become a national priority. The National Research Council (NRC), has recently emphasized upon the importance of developing learners' capacity of reasoning, their argumentation skills and understanding of GCC (Framework for K-12 Science Education, National Research Council, 2012). This framework focuses on fostering conceptual clarity about GCC to promote innovation, resilience, and readiness in students as a response towards the threat of a changing environment. Previous research about teacher understanding of GCC describes that in spite of the prevalent frameworks like the AAAS Science Literacy Atlas (AAAS, 2007) and the Essential Principles for Climate Literacy (United States Global Climate Research Program, 2009; Bardsley, 2007), most learners are challenged in understanding the science of GCC (Michail et al., 2007) and misinformed perceptions about basic climate science content and the role of human activities in changing climate remain persistent (Reibich and Gautier, 2006). Our teacher participants had a rather simplistic knowledge structure. While aware of climate change, teacher participants lacked in depth understanding of how change in climate can impact various ecosystems on the Earth. Furthermore, they felt overwhelmed with the extensive amount of information needed to comprehend the complexity in GCC. Hence, extensive efforts not only focused on assessing conceptual understanding of GCC but also for teaching complex science topics like GCC are essential. This dissertation explains concept mapping, and the photo elicitation method for assessing teachers' understanding of GCC and the use of metacognitive scaffolding in instruction of GCC for developing competence of learners in this complex science phenomenon.

T1  - Customizing scaffolds for game-based learning in physics: Impacts on knowledge acquisition and game design creativity
AN  - 1984308027; 2017-30807-021
AB  - Scaffolds in games have the potential to facilitate learning effects in addition to assisting the gaming process. However, studies on game-based science learning usually only adopt questionnaires to evaluate scientific concepts, and use interviews or observations to assess problem solving ability, neglecting the importance of investigating game-making outcomes. We customized a digital game, "Crayon Physics Deluxe," with varied scaffolding designs to evaluate their effects on science learning. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, marking critical features scaffolding, and the no-game group. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and design creativity (in the form of game episode designs). Students were asked to transform their roles from problem solvers to problem designers, which might not only demonstrate their ability to solve scientific problems, but also develop their creativity potential in designing scientific puzzles. The results indicated that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and the sensitivity dimension of design creativity, while the group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of design creativity. These findings suggest that proper scaffolds could be designed to function as learning scaffolds rather than just as gaming scaffolds, and different learning purposes require various scaffolding designs. The content of the scaffolds, as well as the timing of their provision should be carefully designed according to the game features to achieve specific instructional purposes.

T1  - Essential public health competencies for medical students: Establishing a consensus in family medicine
AN  - 1928289514; 2017-31924-004
AB  - Phenomenon: The integration of public health (PH) competency training into medical education, and further integration of PH and primary care, has been urged by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. However, PH competencies are numerous, and no consensus exists over which competencies are most important for adoption by current trainees. Our objective was to conduct a group concept mapping exercise with stakeholders identifying the most important and feasible PH skills to incorporate in medical and residency curricula. Approach: We utilized a group concept mapping technique via the Concept System Global Max (http://www.conceptsystems.com), where family medicine educators and PH professionals completed the phrase, “A key Public Health competency for physicians-in-training to learn is …” with 1–10 statements. The statement list was edited for duplication and other issues; stakeholders then sorted the statements and rated them for importance and feasibility of integration. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to create a two-dimensional point map of domains of PH training, allowing visual comparison of groupings of related ideas and relative importance of these ideas. Findings: There were 116 nonduplicative statements (225 total) suggested by 120 participants. Three metacategories of competencies emerged: Clinic, Community & Culture, Health System Understanding, and Population Health Science & Data. Insights: We identified and organized a set of topics that serve as a foundation for the integration of family medicine and PH education. Incorporating these topics into medical education is viewed as important and feasible by family medicine educators and PH professions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - An intelligent web-based system for diagnosing student learning problems using concept maps
AN  - 1976692342; 2017-22325-002
AB  - The aim of this article is to propose a method for development of concept map in web-based environment for identifying concepts a student is deficient in after learning using traditional methods. Direct Hashing and Pruning algorithm was used to construct concept map. Redundancies within the concept map were removed to generate a learning sequence. Prototype learning system was developed based on this learning sequence using Android Emulator. For analysis purpose, 42 learners were given to learn the course Java Programming taught at graduation level. A posttest was conducted after learning for evaluation purpose. Multiple regression analysis method was applied on these results to develop regression equations for the proposed method of learning. Statistical Package for Social Sciences software was used for statistical analysis purposes. It was found that posttest results are directly proportional to the quality of traditional learning. Better quality students require less time in constructing prototype system. Further concept mapping was found to have a positive impact on proposed method of learning. When the number of concepts is large, a learning sequence among these can be generated using the proposed method. This learning sequence can be used to identify the concept a student needs additional learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Kind discipline: Developing a conceptual model of a promising school discipline approach
AN  - 1891510274; 2017-15801-004
AB  - This formative evaluation develops a novel conceptual model for a discipline approach fostering intrinsic motivation and positive relationships in schools. We used concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on kind discipline from teachers, administrators, and other school staff. Three core themes describing kind discipline emerged from 11 identified clusters: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. We mapped the identified components of kind discipline onto a social ecological model and found that kind discipline encompasses all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed. Products of the analysis and synthesis reported here are operationalized materials for teachers grounded in a “be kind” culture code for classrooms.

T1  - Science teachers’ use of a concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for the concept of energy
AN  - 1915375398; 2017-20398-002
AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students’ concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers’ marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students’ concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students’ understanding with one student’s performance as a showcase. Teachers’ views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students’ conceptual learning.

T1  - Comparative effects of computer-based concept maps, refutational texts, and expository texts on science learning
AN  - 1968543009; 2017-07062-003
AB  - This study used a between-subjects experimental design to examine the effects of three different computer-based instructional strategies (concept map, refutation text, and expository scientific text) on science learning. Concept maps are node-link diagrams that show concepts as nodes and relationships among the concepts as labeled links. Refutational texts are designed specifically to elicit common misconceptions that learners typically hold about a particular topic, directly refute the misconceptions, and present scientific explanations as compelling alternatives. Expository scientific texts consist of texts that are written specifically to present correct scientific information. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to study one of three computer-based presentations on climate change. The dependent measures were tests of free recall and transfer. The concept map group significantly outperformed the refutational and scientific text groups on both free recall and transfer tests. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Hindsight is 20/20: Reflections on the evolution of concept mapping
AN  - 1857838400; 2016-60217-020
AB  - This paper considers the origins and development of the concept mapping methodology, a summary of its growth, and its influence in a variety of fields. From initial discussions with graduate students, through the rise of the theory-driven approach to program evaluation and the development of a theoretical framework for conceptualization methodology, the paper highlights some of the key early efforts and pilot projects that culminated in a 1989 special issue on the method in 
Evaluation and Program Planning that brought the method to the attention of the field of evaluation. The paper details the thinking that led to the standard version of the method (the analytic sequence, “bridging” index, and pattern matching) and the development of the software for accomplishing it. A bibliometric analysis shows that the rate of citation continues to increase, where it has grown geographically and institutionally, that the method has been used in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and that the literature had an influence on the field. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of some of the key aspects of the approach that warrant further development. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - How is the body’s systemic nature manifested amongst high school biology students?
AN  - 1819920318; 2016-43964-001
AB  - This study follows two groups of students (67 in all) through the 3 years of their high school biology education and examines the development of their systems thinking—specifically their models of the human body as a system. Both groups were composed of biology majors, but the students in one group also participated in a PBLbased extension program called “Medical Systems”. Data was gathered by means of concept maps, which the students completed at four strategic stages of the learning process: beginning of 10th grade, end of 10th grade, end of 11th grade and end of 12th grade. At the end of the 3 year learning process, the students’ showed more complex system models. They included a wider range of concepts in their maps, spanning hierarchy levels ranging from the molecular and cellular to the system level. We also found an increase in references to dynamic interactions, but this did not encourage the students to use cellular level processes when explaining phenomena that occur at the systems level. The impact of the PBL teaching method was strongly evident in the complexity of the Medical Systems program students’ concept maps, which heavily emphasized “hierarchy” and “diseases” as system characteristics.

T1  - Making school discipline kinder: Developing a roadmap for youth well-being
AN  - 1932892408; 2017-10864-147
AB  - BACKGROUND: School discipline—how schools manage and respond to student misbehavior—is a central component of how schools seek to create safe and productive learning environments. School suspensions have been a popular discipline strategy in recent decades. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated the association between punitive discipline strategies and poor outcomes in youth, including increased high school dropout rates, decreased odds of enrolling in postsecondary school, and increased mental health concerns. There is an urgent need to examine alternate mechanisms for addressing school discipline other than punitive exclusionary or reward-based systems. This dissertation seeks to develop an integrated model of promising approaches and define how such a system could work. OBJECTIVES: This dissertation is made up of three studies addressing three aims: (1) to synthesize the existing literature on how school discipline has been constructed and its impact on student well being; (2) to develop a novel conceptual model for an alternate discipline approach, “kind discipline,” and; (3) to develop and validate a measure for assessing the practice of kind discipline in elementary and middle schools. METHODS: Study one is a theoretical review utilizing a social ecological model to frame how school discipline models address an individual, relational, or structural level. Study two is a formative evaluation that develops a novel conceptual model for an alternative discipline approach. This study utilized concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on school discipline from teachers, administrators, school staff, and other stakeholders involved in school programming. The concept mapping included a brainstorming phase, a statement analysis phase, a sorting and rating phase, and multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of the collected data. It culminated in a map that visually represent the group’s ideas and how they are interrelated. Study three validated a newly developed measure of kind discipline through an assessment of the measure’s internal consistency, an exploration of convergent and discriminant validity, and a descriptive analysis of the strength of relationships between kind discipline and school-level discipline frequency. RESULTS: The theoretical review illustrated how different school discipline approaches address disparate explanations of what may lead to student misbehavior. The formative evaluation developed a conceptual model for kind discipline in which three core themes emerged from 11 identified clusters in the conceptual model: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. When mapped onto a social ecological model, the identified components of kind discipline encompassed all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. In the study validating a measure of kind discipline, teacher and student assessments of kind discipline were strongly correlated (Pearson’s Correlation -.772, p=0.005). Convergent validity of the measure was supported by our finding that the more positively students assessed kind discipline in their schools, the lower the school disciplinary action rate (β=-0.759, p=0.05). Mixed linear models showed teachers’ perceived kind discipline at the school level predicted individual students’ perception of kind discipline. Girls reported higher levels of kind discipline than boys; and students in higher grades reported lower levels of kind discipline than students in lower grades. CONCLUSIONS: Effective school discipline programs may need to operate on multiple levels. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using doubly latent multilevel analysis to elucidate relationships between science teachers’ professional knowledge and students’ performance
AN  - 1915380179; 2017-08458-005
AB  - Teachers make a difference for the outcome of their students in science classrooms. One focus in this context lies on teachers’ professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students’ performance in science. Students’ science performance was conceptualised by 
system thinking performance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students’ performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (
N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students’ performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers’ PCK and students’ performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students’ performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes.

T1  - Understanding undergraduate science majors' conceptual knowledge of ecology: Progressions and misconceptions
AN  - 1903672817; 2016-58398-026
AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain an in-depth understanding of undergraduate science majors' conceptual knowledge of ecology. Two separate but related studies were conducted to further explore how ecological knowledge develops as students progress through their undergraduate biology curriculum and how a student-centered teaching strategy may influence development of conceptual knowledge of ecology. The first study examined what ecological misconceptions students have when beginning undergraduate science programs as well as how their conceptual knowledge of ecology changes over the course of their degree programs. A quantitative, cross-sectional methodology was utilized by administering an ecology misconceptions assessment to at seven different time points during the students' (n = 195) academic careers. Results revealed that some students have common misconceptions when they begin their undergraduate science program and those misconceptions are persistent. The most frequent misconceptions are concepts, such as energy and matter, that are taught beginning in elementary school. However, students are developing a conceptual understanding as they progress through their undergraduate programs. Implications of this study include a need for instructors to identify misconceptions of students but also to design instruction that addresses common ecology misconceptions. The second study explored how student-centered collaborative group work affected students' conceptual understanding of ecological concepts and misconceptions. Students completed concept mapping activities as individual assignments then collaboratively completed the mapping again in their respective groups. A mixed methodology was used which included quantitative concept maps scores of complexity and accuracy along with qualitative data from three case studies. There were no differences in accuracy scores but individual maps were found to be more complex than groups. Three cases examined provided insight into group structure and interactions related to conceptual understanding of ecology. Results of this study revealed that Concept mapping activities may help students develop a deeper conceptual understanding of ecology. However, different methods of using collaborative group work strategies to understand ecological misconceptions specifically should be explored.

T1  - Creating independence through student-owned strategies (Project CRISS): Educator accounts of the impact of project CRISS on student learning
AN  - 1891510279; 2016-53069-013
AB  - This mixed-methods study documented the experiences of educators who had used the Project CRISS Program. The program had been implemented since 2001 in Bay District Schools, in Florida. However, educator experiences about the program were not available for future program implementation decisions. Teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators completed a quantitative and qualitative questionnaire about the Project CRISS Program. An analysis of the quantitative data included using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 22.0). Descriptive statistics were reported and analyzed for the survey items using a Likert-type scale. The constant comparison method was used to analyze the qualitative data. Survey items with short answer responses, as well as comments made on the open-ended questions, were transcribed. Findings revealed educators' observations about the Project CRISS Program. Educators observed that prior to implementing Project CRISS, students had experienced difficulty with outlining, note taking, text marking, and highlighting text. Educators observed that after implementing Project CRISS, students increased in their use of content-specific vocabulary, concept mapping for better understanding, and vocabulary to help them elaborate and write in complete sentences. Consequently, students increased their learning confidence as well as competence, and the educators believed that the students assumed more control of their learning. The most frequently implemented Project CRISS strategies were the active strategies of graphic organizers, KWL and KWL+, Venn diagrams, anticipation guides, one-sentence summaries, and picture notes. Educators also observed that students could use 2- and 3- column notes, selective highlighting, and concept maps independently. Recommendations for practice included suggestions for teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators for implementing Project CRISS strategies at the highest level. Future research studies about the Project CRISS program were recommended for Bay District Schools in Florida to provide insights into implementing the program at the highest level.

T1  - New methods for analyzing semantic graph based assessments in science education
AN  - 1883361492; 2016-53063-097
AB  - This research investigated how the scoring of semantic graphs (known by many as concept maps) could be improved and automated in order to address issues of inter-rater reliability and scalability. As part of the NSF funded SENSE-IT project to introduce secondary school science students to sensor networks (NSF Grant No. 0833440), semantic graphs illustrating how temperature change affects water ecology were collected from 221 students across 16 schools. The graphing task did not constrain students' use of terms, as is often done with semantic graph based assessment due to coding and scoring concerns. The graphing software used provided real-time feedback to help students learn how to construct graphs, stay on topic and effectively communicate ideas. The collected graphs were scored by human raters using assessment methods expected to boost reliability, which included adaptations of traditional holistic and propositional scoring methods, use of expert raters, topical rubrics, and criterion graphs. High levels of inter-rater reliability were achieved, demonstrating that vocabulary constraints may not be necessary after all. To investigate a new approach to automating the scoring of graphs, thirty-two different graph features characterizing graphs' structure, semantics, configuration and process of construction were then used to predict human raters' scoring of graphs in order to identify feature patterns correlated to raters' evaluations of graphs' topical accuracy and complexity. Results led to the development of a regression model able to predict raters' scoring with 77% accuracy, with 46% accuracy expected when used to score new sets of graphs, as estimated via cross-validation tests. Although such performance is comparable to other graph and essay based scoring systems, cross-context testing of the model and methods used to develop it would be needed before it could be recommended for widespread use. Still, the findings suggest techniques for improving the reliability and scalability of semantic graph based assessments without requiring constraint of how ideas are expressed.

T1  - Chinese grandparents in Chinese-Caucasian biracial families: Grandparents' ethnic & racial socialization of their biracial grandchildren in the San Francisco Bay Area
AN  - 1878905201; 2016-47716-092
AB  - This dissertation was a qualitative, exploratory and phenomenological study on how mono racial Chinese grandparents racially and ethnically socialize their Chinese-White biracial grandchildren. Participants included thirteen grandmothers, five grandfathers, and fourteen biracial grandchildren. All participants were living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Interviews were conducted with grandparents and their grandchildren to determine grandparents' racial and ethnic socialization methods as well as how biracial grandchildren responded to their grandparents and how they viewed themselves as biracial individuals in the U.S. The study also considered the effect of the ecological context on socialization. The two main theoretical frameworks used in this study included: Bronfenbrenner's ecological theory and Root's "border crossings" theory. Other biracial identity theories, such as Poston's BIDM and Rockquemore and Laszloffy's COBI were mentioned as well. This study had two main goals: 1.) Providing an examination of how Chinese grandparents have addressed their grandchildren's biracial status, how they ethnically and racially socialize their biracial grandchildren, as well as the challenges that they have faced in the socialization process; and 2.) How biracial grandchildren view their grandparents and ecological systems in their process of racial and ethnic socialization. This study's findings have shown the various ways in which grandparents and ecological contexts have influenced their biracial grandchildren's ethnic and racial socialization. Some of these ways included: 1.) The types of racial socialization used, including promotion of egalitarianism, promotion of mistrust, and preparation for bias; 2.) Grandparents defining their own identities; 3.) The influence of growing up in the Bay Area's schools, neighborhoods and communities; 4.) Influence of inherited traits such as one's physical appearance (phenotype) and birth order and; 5.) Grandparents' ethnic socialization in terms of cultural activities and practices. A concept map was created to show the linkages between these various factors in grandparents' ethnic and racial socialization of their biracial grandchildren. The study's findings could be used to help inform family service agencies and health professionals better understand and work with biracial families, especially as the United States' racial demographics continue to change over the following decades.

T1  - A different approach to preparing Novakian concept maps: The indexing method
AN  - 1915378943; 2017-22182-012
AB  - People who claim that applying Novakian concept maps in Turkish is problematic base their arguments largely upon the structural differences between the English and Turkish languages. This study aims to introduce the indexing method to eliminate problems encountered in Turkish applications of Novakian maps and to share the preliminary results of its application. For this purpose, 20 pre-service chemistry teachers who had mastered the concept-mapping method after seven weeks of intense education were asked to prepare concept maps on the topic of atoms by using both the Novakian and indexing methods. The maps were qualitatively assessed by experts regarding informational content. The participants were asked to state in writing their opinions about the indexing method. The resulting analysis revealed that the participants were able to express the relation between two concepts more realistically when they used the indexing method, and the resulting maps were much richer in informational content. Almost all participants (95%) stated that the new method was more convenient in terms of reflecting the necessary mental information. The results of the study show the indexing method to be a much more convenient and informative way of preparing concept maps for both teachers and students.

T1  - Learning science by constructing models: Can Dragoon increase learning without increasing the time required?
AN  - 1832750203; 2016-46930-003
AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction.

T1  - The SOS-framework (Systems of Sedentary behaviours): An international transdisciplinary consensus framework for the study of determinants, research priorities and policy on sedentary behaviour across the life course: A DEDIPAC-study
AN  - 1812929868; 2016-35481-001
AB  - Background: Ecological models are currently the most used approaches to classify and conceptualise determinants of sedentary behaviour, but these approaches are limited in their ability to capture the complexity of and interplay between determinants. The aim of the project described here was to develop a transdisciplinary dynamic framework, grounded in a system-based approach, for research on determinants of sedentary behaviour across the life span and intervention and policy planning and evaluation. Methods: A comprehensive concept mapping approach was used to develop the Systems Of Sedentary behaviours (SOS) framework, involving four main phases: (1) preparation, (2) generation of statements, (3) structuring (sorting and ranking), and (4) analysis and interpretation. The first two phases were undertaken between December 2013 and February 2015 by the DEDIPAC KH team (DEterminants of DIet and Physical Activity Knowledge Hub). The last two phases were completed during a two-day consensus meeting in June 2015. Results: During the first phase, 550 factors regarding sedentary behaviour were listed across three age groups (i.e., youths, adults and older adults), which were reduced to a final list of 190 life course factors in phase 2 used during the consensus meeting. In total, 69 international delegates, seven invited experts and one concept mapping consultant attended the consensus meeting. The final framework obtained during that meeting consisted of six clusters of determinants: Physical Health and Wellbeing (71 % consensus), Social and Cultural Context (59 % consensus), Built and Natural Environment (65 % consensus), Psychology and Behaviour (80 % consensus), Politics and Economics (78 % consensus), and Institutional and Home Settings (78 % consensus). Conducting studies on Institutional Settings was ranked as the first research priority. The view that this framework captures a system-based map of determinants of sedentary behaviour was expressed by 89 % of the participants. Conclusion: Through an international transdisciplinary consensus process, the SOS framework was developed for the determinants of sedentary behaviour through the life course. Investigating the influence of Institutional and Home Settings was deemed to be the most important area of research to focus on at present and potentially the most modifiable. The SOS framework can be used as an important tool to prioritise future research and to develop policies to reduce sedentary time. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Exploring the effects of employing Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping on achievement, concept representation, and attitudes
AN  - 1835547655; 2016-50952-011
AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping (CCM) by comparing it with a paper-and-pencil approach. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a physics course. The control group drew concept maps using the paper-and-pencil method and face-to-face discussion, whereas the experimental group employed Google Docs to create concept maps and used Google Chat for discussion. Learning achievements, physics concept representation, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward CCM were examined to identify the differences between the two groups and the effectiveness of Google Docs. The results suggested that the use of Google Docs did not significantly affect physics achievement. However, Google Docs fostered physics concept representation and enhanced attitudes toward science. Moreover, the Google Docs group tended to learn more collaboratively. The students in this group also agreed with the superiority of observation and modification functions provided by the real-time co-editing mechanism and revision history.

T1  - Impact of a concept map teaching approach on nursing students’ critical thinking skills
AN  - 1960444104; 2016-42763-012
AB  - Nurses confront complex problems and decisions that require critical thinking in order to identify patient needs and implement best practices. An active strategy for teaching students the skills to think critically is the concept map. This study explores the development of critical thinking among nursing students in a required pathophysiology and pharmacology course during the first year of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in response to concept mapping as an interventional strategy, using the Health Education Systems, Incorporated critical thinking test. A two‐group experimental study with a pretest and posttest design was used. Participants were randomly divided into a control group (
n = 42) taught by traditional didactic lecturing alone, and an intervention group (
n = 41), taught by traditional didactic lecturing with concept mapping. Students in the concept mapping group performed much better on the Health Education Systems, Incorporated than students in the control group. It is recommended that deans, program directors, and nursing faculties evaluate their curricula to integrate concept map teaching strategies in courses in order to develop critical thinking abilities in their students.

T1  - The effects of integrating computer-based concept mapping for physics learning in junior high school
AN  - 1903672020; 2017-01184-017
AB  - It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received “Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum” instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention.

T1  - Using metacognitive strategies in teaching to facilitate understanding of light concepts among year 9 students
AN  - 1832752249; 2016-49072-002
AB  - Background: Enhancing students’ metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts. Purpose: The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students’ metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science. Sample: A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study. Design and methods: The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him. In order to enhance the students’ metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, the 
Metacognitive Support Questionnaire (MSpQ) and the 
Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire (MStQ), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light. Results: The results showed gains in the 
MSpQ but not in the 
MStQ. However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test. Conclusion: Although the quantitative data obtained from the 
Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire did not show significant gains in the students’ metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students’ metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire showed that there were significant gains in the students’ perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students’ achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly.

T1  - Influence of using challenging tasks in biology classrooms on students’ cognitive knowledge structure: An empirical video study
AN  - 1931720995; 2017-04825-001
AB  - Empirical analysis of secondary biology classrooms revealed that, on average, 68% of teaching time in Germany revolved around processing tasks. Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons pertaining to the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’. Two fundamental characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition, summary, define, classify and high level information processing: interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or concept level content). Additionally, 
students’ cognitive knowledge structure about the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’ was measured using student-drawn concept maps (
N = 970 students). Finally, linear multilevel models were created with 
high-level cognitive processing tasks and 
higher content complexity tasks as class-level predictors and 
students’ prior knowledge, students’ interest in biology, and 
students’ interest in biology activities as control covariates. Results showed a positive influence of 
high-level cognitive processing tasks (β = 0.07; 
p < .01) on students’ cognitive knowledge structure. However, there was no observed effect of 
higher content complexity tasks on 
students’ cognitive knowledge structure. Presented findings encourage the use of 
high-level cognitive processing tasks in biology instruction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

Grade 7 students’ posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest–posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students’ achievement and improve their attitude.

T1  - The articulation of integration of clinical and basic sciences in concept maps: Differences between experienced and resident groups
AN  - 1752357515; 2015-58049-001
AB  - To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula.

T1  - Effects of a question prompt-based concept mapping approach on students’ learning achievements, attitudes and 5C competences in project-based computer course activities
AN  - 1847423463; 2016-35586-016
AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students’ organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education.

T1  - Intersection of argumentation and the use of multiple representations in the context of socioscientific issues
AN  - 1910785662; 2017-04830-003
AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non- mediated and drawn from personal experience.

T1  - The state-of-the-science on somatosensory function and its impact on daily life in adults and older adults, and following stroke: A scoping review
AN  - 1814149914; 2016-29910-002
AB  - The aim was to identify and synthesize research evidence about how adults and older adults process somatosensory information in daily activities, and the interventions available to regain somatosensory function following stroke. We developed two interacting concept maps to address the research questions. The scoping review was conducted from 2005 to 2015 across Web of Science, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and PsychInfo databases. Search terms included somatosensory, perception, performance, participation, older adult, stroke, intervention, discrimination, learning, and neuroplasticity. Contributions from 103 articles for Concept 1 and 14 articles for Concept 2 are reported. Measures of somatosensory processing, performance, and participation used are identified. Interventions available to treat somatosensory loss are summarized in relation to approach, outcome measures, and theory/mechanisms underlying. A gap exists in the current understanding of how somatosensory function affects the daily lives of adults. A multidisciplinary approach that includes performance and participation outcomes is recommended to advance the field. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system on learners’ learning performance and cognitive load in earth science course
AN  - 1887205969; 2016-36951-004
AB  - Gesture-based learning have particularities, because learners interact in the learning process through the actual way, just like they interact in the nondigital world. It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners’ learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90 participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system, conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. Learners’ cognitive load was also measured and showed that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials.

T1  - Understanding nurses' decision‐making when managing weaning from mechanical ventilation: A study of novice and experienced critical care nurses in Scotland and Greece
AN  - 1803819002; 2016-04962-014
AB  - Aim and objectives: To examine how nurses collect and use cues from respiratory assessment to inform their decisions as they wean patients from ventilatory support. Background: Prompt and accurate identification of the patient's ability to sustain reduction of ventilatory support has the potential to increase the likelihood of successful weaning. Nurses' information processing during the weaning from mechanical ventilation has not been well‐described. Design: A descriptive ethnographic study exploring critical care nurses' decision‐making processes when weaning mechanically ventilated patients from ventilatory support in the real setting. Methods: Novice and expert Scottish and Greek nurses from two tertiary intensive care units were observed in real practice of weaning mechanical ventilation and were invited to participate in reflective interviews near the end of their shift. Data were analysed thematically using concept maps based on information processing theory. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Results: Scottish and Greek critical care nurses acquired patient‐centred objective physiological and subjective information from respiratory assessment and previous knowledge of the patient, which they clustered around seven concepts descriptive of the patient's ability to wean. Less experienced nurses required more encounters of cues to attain the concepts with certainty. Subjective criteria were intuitively derived from previous knowledge of patients' responses to changes of ventilatory support. All nurses used focusing decision‐making strategies to select and group cues in order to categorise information with certainty and reduce the mental strain of the decision task. Conclusions: Nurses used patient‐centred information to make a judgment about the patients' ability to wean. Decision‐making strategies that involve categorisation of patient‐centred information can be taught in bespoke educational programmes for mechanical ventilation and weaning. Relevance to clinical practice Advanced clinical reasoning skills and accurate detection of cues in respiratory assessment by critical care nurses will ensure optimum patient management in weaning mechanical ventilation.

T1  - Identifying the critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole in secondary science classrooms
AN  - 1732319370; 2015-49974-001
AB  - The amount of substance and its unit the mole is a basic concept in chemistry. However, previous research has shown that teaching and learning the concept are challenging tasks for both teachers and students. The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the problems which emerge in the teaching and learning process, and provide integrated suggestions for classroom instruction. By means of videotaping and interviews, the case studies explored how the mole is presented and conceptualized in two secondary classrooms in two different countries, Australia and Taiwan. Data analysis was based on a concept map and focused on how two key ideas were presented in the lessons and perceived by the students: (1) the definition of the mole, and (2) the concept of molar mass. The findings show that during the lessons on the mole, most of the time was spent on solving stoichiometric problems. Conceptually, the number aspect of the mole, that is, Avogadro's number, was emphasized; the concept of molar mass was introduced without meaningfully connecting it to the concept of relative atomic/molecular mass. Although the students were able to solve relevant problems, they could not coherently explain the relations among the concepts. Two critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole emerged: (1) the number aspect of the mole needs to be justified by its mass aspect, and (2) the connection between molar mass and relative atomic/molecular mass needs to be explicitly explained. The two components provide one explanation for students' algorithmic learning and their confusion in learning about the mole, and serve as concrete suggestions for improving classroom instruction. The study once again manifested the significance of teaching for conceptual understanding in science education. It also exemplifies how a concept map of a specific scientific concept can also be a useful analytical tool in educational research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - An action research in science: Providing metacognitive support to year 9 students
AN  - 1924688159; 2017-17882-022
AB  - An action research study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of providing metacognitive support to enhance Year 9 students’ metacognitive capabilities in order to better understand science concepts related to light, environmental health, ecosystems, genetics, ecology, atoms and the Periodic Table. The study was conducted over three years involving 35, 20 and 24 students in each year. The interventions included providing students with clearly stated focused outcomes about the relevant science concepts, engaging in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and posttest results of the 
Metacognitive Support Questionnaire (
MSpQ). The results showed gains in the 
MSpQ. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Exploring pre-service science teacher methods and strategies for the driving questions in research inquiry: From consulting an instructor to group discussion
AN  - 1910783562; 2017-16685-004
AB  - An important stage in any research inquiry is the development of research questions that need to be answered. The strategies to develop research questions should be defined and described, but few studies have considered this process in greater detail. This study explores pre-service science teachers’ research questions and the strategies they can engage in during inquiry. A total of 59 pre-service science teachers who attended an undergraduate Fieldwork Course participated in the study. A single, holistic case study design was used along with an open-ended questionnaire and documents for data collection. The questionnaire was conducted at the end of the course, and documented inquiry reports were analyzed. The results indicate there are 11 methods for defining driving questions. These range from consulting an instructor to group discussion; 21 different strategies can be produced using these methods. These research question defining methods and strategies should be applied as a coding scheme for future studies and expanded. Any research question defining strategies unfamiliar to pre-service science teachers, such as field trips, brainstorming, and concept maps, should then be taught.

T1  - A study of concept mapping as an instructional intervention in an undergraduate general chemistry calorimetry laboratory
AN  - 1830077810; 2016-37854-029
AB  - This investigation, rooted in both chemistry and education, considers outcomes occurring in a small-scale study in which concept mapping was used as an instructional intervention in an undergraduate calorimetry laboratory. A quasi-experimental, multiple-methods approach was employed since the research questions posed in this study warranted the use of both qualitative and quantitative perspectives and evaluations. For the intervention group of students, a convenience sample, post-lab concept maps, written discussions, quiz responses and learning surveys were characterized and evaluated. Archived quiz responses for non-intervention students were also analyzed for comparison. Students uniquely constructed individual concept maps containing incorrect, conceptually correct and "scientifically thin" calorimetry characterizations. Students more greatly emphasized mathematical relationships and equations utilized during the calorimetry experiment; the meaning of calorimetry concepts was demonstrated to a lesser extent.

T1  - The Salient Map Analysis for Research and Teaching (SMART) method: Powerful potential as a formative assessment in the biomedical sciences
AN  - 1821806652; 2016-31152-137
AB  - This dissertation consists of two studies: 1) development and characterization of the Salient Map Analysis for Research and Teaching (SMART) method as a formative assessment tool and 2) a case study exploring how a paramedic instructor's beliefs about learners affect her utilization of the SMART method and vice versa. The first study explored: How can a novel concept map analysis method be designed as an effective formative assessment tool? The SMART method improves upon existing concept map analysis methods because it does not require hierarchically structured concept maps and it preserves the rich content of the maps instead of reducing each map down to a numerical score. The SMART method is performed by comparing a set of students' maps to each other and to an instructor's map. The resulting composite map depicts, in percentages and highlighted colors, the similarities and differences between all of the maps. Some advantages of the SMART method as a formative assessment tool include its ability to highlight changes across time, problematic or alternative conceptions, and patterns of student responses at a glance. Study two explored: How do a paramedic instructor's beliefs about students and learning affect---and become affected by---her use of the SMART method as a formative assessment tool? This case study of Angel, an expert paramedic instructor, begins to address a gap in the emergency medical services (EMS) education literature, which contains almost no research on teachers or pedagogy. Angel and I worked together as participant co-researchers (Heron & Reason, 1997) exploring the affordances of the SMART method. This study, based on those interactions with Angel, involved using open coding to identify themes (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) from Angel's views of students and use of the SMART method. Angel views learning as a sense-making process. She has a multi-faceted view of her students as novices and invests substantial time trying to understand their concept maps. Not only do these beliefs affect her use of the SMART method; in addition, her beliefs are refined through the use of the SMART method. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept mapping as a tool for for enhancing self-paced learning in a distance scenario
AN  - 1812935087; 2016-26515-195
AB  - Researchers have determined that concept maps serve as effective tools in the traditional science classroom. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate concept mapping as a tool for student knowledge acquisition in 10th grade science for students in distance learning situations. Research questions were designed to investigate the influence of concept mapping on rate and quality of student knowledge acquisition and retention. This study was a pretest-posttest 2-group comparison study, constructivist in nature and based on the theory of cognitive learning. Participants included 36 students in the 10th grade at an inner-city school in the United States. Control and treatment groups participated in completing pre and posttesting to establish standards for initial understanding and knowledge acquired. Pretest scores were used in a 2-tailed t test to establish equivalence between groups at the beginning of the study. ANOVA was used with test gains to determine differences between treatment and control groups. Cronbach's alpha was conducted to test for concept map interrater reliability. A 2-tailed t test for matched groups was used with concept map scores and treatment group test gains to determine any relationship. No statistically significant relationship between the use of concept maps and distance learning was found. Recommendations for future research include a wider age range for participants and investigations of academic areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, and language acquisition, native and foreign. Implications for positive social change include research with altered parameters to identify an existing tool that may be used by students in the traditional classroom as well as in distance-learning scenarios.

T1  - Exploring science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge in the teaching of genetics in Swaziland
AN  - 1812929239; 2016-21246-216
AB  - Recent trends show that learners' enrolment and performance in science at secondary school level is dwindling. Some science topics including genetics in biology are said to be difficult for learners to learn and thus they perform poorly in examinations. Teacher knowledge base, particularly topic-specific pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), has been identified by many researchers as an important factor that is linked with learner understanding and achievement in science. This qualitative study was an attempt to explore the PCK of four successful biology teachers and how they developed it in the context of teaching genetics. The purposive sampling technique was employed to select the participating teachers based on their schools' performance in biology public examinations and recommendations by science specialists and school principals. Pedagogical content knowledge was used as a theoretical framework for the study, which guided the inquiry in data collection, analysis and discussion of the research findings. The study adopted the case study method and various sources of evidence including concept maps, lesson plans, pre-lesson interviews, lesson observations, post-teaching teacher questionnaire, post-lesson interviews and document analysis were used to collect data on teachers' PCK as well as how PCK was assumed to have developed. The data were analysed in an attempt to determine the individual teachers' school genetics' content knowledge, related knowledge of instructional strategies and knowledge of learners' preconceptions and learning difficulties. The analysis involved an iterative process of coding data into PCK categories of content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of learners' preconceptions and learning difficulties. The findings of the study indicate that the four successful biology teachers generally have the necessary content knowledge of school genetics, used certain topic-specific instructional strategies, but lacked knowledge of genetics-related learners' preconceptions and learning difficulties despite having taught the topic for many years. There were some instructional deficits in their approaches and techniques in teaching genetics. The teachers failed to use physical models, teacher demonstration and/or learner experimentation in their lessons (or include them in their lesson plans) to assist learners in visualizing or internalizing the genetics concepts or processes located at the sub-microscopic level. The teachers' PCK in genetics teaching was assumed to have developed mainly through formal university education programmes, classroom teaching experiences, peer support and participation in in-service workshops. The implications for biology teacher education are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A Vygotskian analysis of preservice teachers' conceptions of dissolving and density
AN  - 1803466638; 2016-17336-152
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the content knowledge of 64 elementary preservice teachers for the concepts of dissolving and density. Vygotsky's (1987) theory of concept development was used as a framework to categorize concepts and misconceptions resulting from evidences of preservice teacher knowledge including pre/post concept maps, writing artifacts, pre/post face-to-face interviews, examination results, and drawings. Statistical significances were found for pre- and post-concept map scores for dissolving (t = -5.773, p < 0.001) and density (t = -2.948, p = 0.005). As measured using Cohen's d values, increases in mean scores showed a medium-large effect size for (dissolving) and a small effect size for density. The triangulated results using all data types revealed that preservice teachers held several robust misconceptions about dissolving including the explanation that dissolving is a breakdown of substances, a formation of mixtures, and/or involves chemical change. Most preservice teachers relied on concrete concepts (such as rate or solubility) to explain dissolving. With regard to density, preservice teachers held two robust misconceptions including confusing density with buoyancy to explain the phenomena of floating and sinking, and confusing density with heaviness, mass, and weight. Most preservice teachers gained one concept for density, the density algorithm. Most preservice teachers who participated in this study demonstrated Vygotsky's notion of complex thinking and were unable to transform their thinking to the scientific conceptual level. That is, they were unable to articulate an understanding of either the process of dissolving or density that included a unified system of knowledge characterized as abstract, generalizable and hierarchical. Results suggest the need to instruct preservice elementary science teachers about the particulate nature of matter, intermolecular forces, and the Archimedes' principle.

T1  - The effect on students' mathematical beliefs by integrating history of mathematics in the classroom
AN  - 1786799654; 2016-17337-020
AB  - This study, with an analysis of over 40 empirical researches about the history of mathematics teaching, discovered that only a few studies conducted research about the evolution and development of history of mathematics and they seldom analysed students' mathematical beliefs. In order to fill the gap, this study is aimed to design the topic of function through the perspective of the evolution and development, namely from the Babylonian tables to discontinuous function. It also seeks to explore how that affects students' mathematical beliefs including math fun, math humane scale, mathematical evolution, and students' views of mathematics. The study was conducted among two classes of F.4 students who have the similar mathematics abilities in a local secondary school. One is the experimental group and another one is the reference group. The teaching materials developed by the researcher were used in the experimental group while the textbooks were used in the reference group. Through cognitive tests, questionnaires, interviews, concept maps and teacher journals, the way in which the history of mathematics affects students' mathematical beliefs is explored. The subsequent analysis of the data attempts to answer the following questions: How the history of mathematics affects students' mathematical cognitive level? How history of mathematics affects students' mathematics attitudes? What difficulties the teacher suffers when using this teaching material? Are there any differences between the normal teaching and history of mathematics teaching? Are there any changes in teacher's mathematical belief? Is it appropriate to conduct history of mathematics teaching in senior form? This study discovers that history of mathematics has different effects on students of various mathematical abilities. When selecting the material of history of mathematics, stakeholders need to pay attention to students' mathematics abilities and interests as well as make appropriate adjustments to teaching, so that students of different mathematical ability can obtain different levels of expansion on their mathematical beliefs.

T1  - Scaffolding students' use of learner-generated content in a technology-enhanced inquiry learning environment
AN  - 1771735570; 2016-03680-013
AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (
n = 19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (
n = 23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Comparing two forms of concept map critique activities to facilitate knowledge integration processes in evolution education
AN  - 1762379786; 2016-02989-007
AB  - Concept map activities often lack a subsequent revision step that facilitates knowledge integration. This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (
n = 81) using an online inquiry‐based learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peer‐review. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert‐map condition focused mostly on concept‐focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer‐review condition used more link‐focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes.

T1  - Mapping the views of adolescent health stakeholders
AN  - 1760329478; 2015-58356-005
AB  - Purpose: Health research that includes youth and family stakeholders increases the contextual relevance of findings, which can benefit both the researchers and stakeholders involved. The goal of this study was to identify youth and family adolescent health priorities and to explore strategies to address these concerns. Methods: Stakeholders identified important adolescent health concerns, perceptions of which were then explored using concept mapping. Concept mapping is a mixed-method participatory research approach that invites input from various stakeholders. In response to prompts, stakeholders suggested ways to address the identified health conditions. Adolescent participants then sorted the statements into groups based on content similarity and rated the statements for importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were then applied to create the concept maps. Results: Stakeholders identified sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and obesity as the health conditions they considered most important. The concept map for STIs identified 7 clusters: General sex education, support and empowerment, testing and treatment, community involvement and awareness, prevention and protection, parental involvement in sex education, and media. The obesity concept map portrayed 8 clusters: Healthy food choices, obesity education, support systems, clinical and community involvement, community support for exercise, physical activity, nutrition support, and nutrition education. Ratings were generally higher for importance than for feasibility. Conclusions: The concept maps demonstrate stakeholder-driven ideas about approaches to target STIs and obesity in this context. Strategies at multiple social ecological levels were emphasized. The concept maps can be used to generate discussion regarding these topics and to identify interventions.

T1  - Outcomes of interorganizational networks in Canada for chronic disease prevention: Insights from a concept mapping study, 2015
AN  - 1898078925; 2016-24105-001
AB  - Introduction: We conducted a mixed methods study from June 2014 to March 2015 to assess the perspectives of stakeholders in networks that adopt a population approach for chronic disease prevention (CDP). The purpose of the study was to identify important and feasible outcome measures for monitoring network performance. Methods: Participants from CDP networks in Canada completed an online concept mapping exercise, which was followed by interviews with network stakeholders to further understand the findings. Results: Nine concepts were considered important outcomes of CDP networks: enhanced learning, improved use of resources, enhanced or increased relationships, improved collaborative action, network cohesion, improved system outcomes, improved population health outcomes, improved practice and policy planning, and improved intersectoral engagement. Three themes emerged from participant interviews related to measurement of the identified concepts: the methodological difficulties in measuring network outcomes, the dynamic nature of network evolution and function and implications for outcome assessment, and the challenge of measuring multisectoral engagement in CDP networks. Conclusion: Results from this study provide initial insights into concepts that can be used to describe the outcomes of networks for CDP and may offer foundations for strengthening network outcome-monitoring strategies and methodologies.

T1  - The effects of scientific representations on primary students’ development of scientific discourse and conceptual understandings during cooperative contemporary inquiry-science
AN  - 1775179045; 2015-50305-004
AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers’ classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimental
a), the contemporary condition (Experimental
b), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students’ discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimental
a and Experimental
b conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students’ scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently.

T1  - Promoting conceptual coherence within context‐based biology education
AN  - 1734303770; 2015-38297-007
AB  - In secondary science education, the learning and teaching of coherent conceptual understanding are often problematic. Context‐based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context‐embedded learning‐teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context‐based lesson sequence about protein‐rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th‐grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context‐embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Elementary pre-service teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving: A Vygotskian concept development perspective
AN  - 1732322255; 2015-40614-002
AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers’ misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention. Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky’s theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness. Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers’ understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention. Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers’ did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers’ prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors.

Teachers who are skilled concept mappers are able to (1) understand and apply the operational terms to construct a hierarchical/non-hierarchical concept map; (2) identify the legitimacy of the constructed concept map by verifying its graphical structure and its educational utility; and (3) determine the inherent ‘good’ and ‘poor’ qualities of the resulting graphical structure to reiterate the ‘good’ qualities and to coach and provide feedback to alleviate ‘poor’ qualities.Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of prospective teachers’ knowledge underpinning the technique used to construct concept maps and thus, explicate their facility to construct concept maps.Sample, Design and Methods: Data consisted of 200 concept maps constructed by prospective teachers in an elementary science methods course.Results: Analysis revealed that the prospective teachers had predominantly constructed either hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical concept maps. It is likely that their maps reflect the teaching that they themselves would have experienced in their science classrooms during their own education. Additionally, most of these concepts maps only contained the root concept and subordinate concepts and lacked directional linking lines, linking phrases, labelled lines and propositions.Conclusions: We argue that teacher educators need to assess their prospective teachers’ understanding of concept mapping in relation to the legitimacy (the nature and quality) of the end-products (graphical structures) of such practices. Prospective teachers also need to understand the educational utility of concept mapping in terms of how these end-products impact and/or effectuate learning.

T1  - Concept maps in the classroom: A new approach to reveal students’ conceptual change
AN  - 1685828527; 2015-19380-007
AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students’ concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors’ approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students’ conceptions.

T1  - Using a modelling language for supporting university students’ orienting activity when studying research methods
AN  - 1981173458; 2016-57492-001
AB  - The present study focuses on examining how digitally guided conceptual mapping can be used in orienting students in higher education to learn complex domain content and practices. The educational setting investigated was targeted at doctoral students in the behavioural sciences who were learning qualitative and mixed methods in their own research activities. The students used digitalized conceptual tools to construct an external representation of research methods in the form of concept maps. The concept maps worked as orienting bases that were considered to inform their further domain-specific activity and corresponding learning goals. The students were found to implement the digital guidelines in various ways, depending on their previous knowledge and current knowledge-driven needs. The orienting bases by the students allowed the teacher to tailor her guidance according to the domain-specific challenges that the students encountered in studying the principles and practices of research methods.

T1  - Key characteristics of successful science learning: The promise of learning by modelling
AN  - 1724444509; 2015-43192-002
AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose–insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary (
n = 15), concept map (
n = 16), model (
n = 23), and outlined model (
n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students’ learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats.

T1  - Using concept maps in a modified team-based learning exercise
AN  - 1692409814; 2015-17883-004
AB  - Medical school education has traditionally been driven by single discipline teaching and assessment. Newer medical school curricula often implement an organ-based approach that fosters integration of basic science and clinical disciplines. Concept maps are widely used in education. Through diagrammatic depiction of a variety of concepts and their specific connections with other ideas, concept maps provide a unique perspective into learning and performance that can complement other assessment methods commonly used in medical schools. In this innovation, we describe using concepts maps as a vehicle for a modified a classic Team-Based Learning (TBL) exercise. Modifications to traditional TBL in our innovation included replacing an individual assessment using multiple-choice questions with concept maps as well as combining the group assessment and application exercise whereby teams created concept maps. These modifications were made to further assess understanding of content across the Fundamentals module (the introductory module of the preclerkship curriculum). While preliminary, student performance and feedback from faculty and students support the use of concept maps in TBL. Our findings suggest concept maps can provide a unique means of determining assessment of learning and generating feedback to students. Concept maps can also demonstrate knowledge acquisition, organization of prior and new knowledge, and synthesis of that knowledge across disciplines in a unique way providing an additional means of assessment in addition to traditional multiple-choice questions.

T1  - Effects of conceptual, procedural, and declarative reflection on students’ structural knowledge in physics
AN  - 1660456109; 2015-08290-001
AB  - Reflection has recently been emphasized as a constructive pedagogical activity. However, little attention has been given to the quality of reflections that students write. In this study, we explored the reflections that students make about their knowledge organization as part of a formative learning activity. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge structures of Grade 11 physics students and their instructors using pathfinder networks (PFnets). Each student’s knowledge structure was compared with the instructors’ averaged knowledge structure in order to identify student misconceptions. As an intervention, students were asked to write reflections on the discrepancies between their knowledge structure and their instructors’ averaged knowledge structure. The students’ reflections were divided into the following three categories depending on the type of knowledge constructed in those reflections: (1) conceptual, (2) procedural, or (3) declarative. Evidence was provided by the study that reflection was an effective means of improving students’ knowledge structure. However, conceptual reflections were the most effective, followed by procedural and declarative reflection. Implications for formative classroom assessment are discussed.

T1  - Concept mapping: A strategy to increase critical thinking in nursing students: An action research study
AN  - 1721925700; 2015-99180-595
AB  - This Action Research Project examined the strategy of concept mapping and its influence on the development of critical thinking in first semester junior nursing students. Participants of the study consisted of juniors from a small university that were randomly divided into two groups, control and intervention. The Health Science Reasoning Test (HRST) was used to determine the critical thinking of both groups before and after the intervention. Data was gathered and analyzed to determine the impact of concept mapping on the critical thinking skills. The scores from the HRST, the exam grades pre and post intervention, and a survey to determine the participant's perceptions about concept mapping. The results showed no significant increases in critical thinking or exam scores. The self-reporting of participants on the survey ranged from concept maps were seen as very useful to participants unable to discern any benefits from the concept maps produced. Although the study did not provide the anticipated results the study may add to the body of knowledge in a limited fashion and direct others in the design of future studies.

T1  - The effects of using concept mapping as an artifact to engender metacognitive thinking in first-year medical students' problem-based learning discussions: A mixed-methods investigation
AN  - 1703298709; 2015-99150-594
AB  - Attention in medical education is turning toward instruction that not only focuses on knowledge acquisition, but on developing the medical students’ clinical problem-solving skills, and their ability to critically think through complex diseases. Metacognition is regarded as an important consideration in how we teach medical students these higher-order, critical thinking skills. This study used a mixed-methods research design to investigate if concept mapping as an artifact may engender metacognitive thinking in the medical student population. Specifically the purpose of the study is twofold: (1) to determine if concept mapping, functioning as an artifact during problem-based learning, improves learning as measured by scores on test questions; and (2) to explore if the process of concept mapping alters the problem-based learning intragroup discussion in ways that show medical students are engaged in metacognitive thinking. The results showed that students in the problem-based learning concept-mapping groups used more metacognitive thinking patterns than those in the problem-based learning discussion-only group, particularly in the monitoring component. These groups also engaged in a higher level of cognitive thinking associated with reasoning through mechanisms-of-action and breaking down complex biochemical and physiologic principals. The students disclosed in focus-group interviews that concept mapping was beneficial to help them understand how discrete pieces of information fit together in a bigger structure of knowledge. They also stated that concept mapping gave them some time to think through these concepts in a larger conceptual framework. There was no significant difference in the exam-question scores between the problem-based learning concept-mapping groups and the problem-based learning discussion-only group.

T1  - Development of a concept exploration based teaching methodology for undergraduate chemistry education
AN  - 1692316871; 2015-99130-032
AB  - Science in general has traditionally been noted as a difficult subject because of its specialized language, mathematical and abstract concepts, and the amount of content to be learned in a semester. In particular, students are believed to base their attitudes towards science-related disciplines on their perceived abilities in understanding or succeeding in a course. Other factors may also contribute to this lack of interest, such as students' metacognitive skills. Concept mapping and computer-aided tools may be used to assist students in building hierarchical knowledge bases that allow them to visually represent connections between concepts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of students using alternative learning aids (concept maps, ontology) to traditional learning aids used in an introductory chemistry course. This study consisted of three phases of implementation (control, treatment 1, and treatment 2 groups) over a three semester period. Phase 1 consisted of the control group, phase 2 consisted of the first treatment group with the addition of the four concept mapping homework assignments in the curriculum and phase 3 consisted of the second treatment group with the integration of the same four concept mapping assignments as phase 2 with the addition of using the Creonto "Intro Chemistry" ontology software. Students in all three phases were assessed using standardized examination questions that were based on the four concept mapping topics and pre- and post-surveys administered at the beginning and end of the semester. Students in phase 2 and 3 groups were also assessed from their constructed concept maps to measure their abilities to explain connections between key concepts. The results of this study suggest that students who created concept maps using the Creonto "Intro Chemistry" software performed better on exams and were able to make more connections when creating concept maps compared to students who did not create concept maps or use computers to assist them. For the exams, there was a statistically significant difference between treatment groups' exams 1 and 3 mean scores. For the concept maps, there was a statistically significant difference in students' abilities to explain connections between key concepts. There was no statistically significant difference in attitudes toward chemistry between groups in this study. However, there was a significant statistical difference in metacognitive skills between the groups. More research is needed to gain a better insight into factors that might have affected students in the course. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effect of a computer program designed with constructivist principles for college non-science majors on understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration
AN  - 1674700516; 2015-99071-108
AB  - The primary objective of this project was to learn what effect a computer program would have on academic achievement and attitude toward science of college students enrolled in a biology class for non-science majors. It became apparent that the instructor also had an effect on attitudes toward science. The researcher designed a computer program, the CELE program, for use in instruction on photosynthesis and cellular respiration. The researcher modified existing instruments to assess academic achievement in understanding photosynthesis and cellular respiration and to assess student attitudes toward these topics. The researcher also used concept maps to assess student understanding of the material. The CELE program had no significant effect on academic achievement or student attitudes, which was possibly due to students' not engaging with the program as anticipated. The instructor had a significant effect on student attitudes toward photosynthesis and cellular respiration as well as on misconceptions that were not detected on the pretest but were detected on the posttest.

T1  - Improving learning with science and social studies text using computer-based concept maps for students with disabilities
AN  - 1653147059; 2015-05151-006
AB  - Concept maps have been used to help students with learning disabilities (LD) improve literacy skills and content learning, predominantly in secondary school. However, despite increased access to classroom technology, no previous studies have examined the efficacy of computer-based concept maps to improve learning from informational text for students with LD in elementary school. In this study, we used a concurrent delayed multiple probe design to evaluate the interactive use of computer-based concept maps on content acquisition with science and social studies texts for Hispanic students with LD in Grades 4 and 5. Findings from this study suggest that students improved content knowledge during intervention relative to a traditional instruction baseline condition. Learning outcomes and social validity information are considered to inform recommendations for future research and the feasibility of classroom implementation.

T1  - Promoting prosocial behaviors to prevent dating violence among college students: Evaluation of a bystander intervention
AN  - 1648596254; 2015-99020-488
AB  - The objective of this dissertation was to evaluate a bystander behavior program at the Jefferson College of Health Sciences (JCHS) in Roanoke, Virginia. Specifically, this dissertation examined the: (1) preliminary measurement properties of a newly developed bystander behavior intention scale; (2) impact of the bystander intervention at JCHS; and (3) underlying processes that influence bystander behaviors. Approximately 25 percent of college students are in a physically abusive dating relationship (Miller, 2011). Bystander programs are one strategy to decrease dating violence and increase prosocial behaviors (Banyard, 2008; Banyard, Moynihan, & Plante, 2007; McMahon & Banyard, 2012). This is one of the first known studies to define bystander behaviors towards dating violence and evaluate a bystander behavior program that was designed to be less resource intensive for college campuses with limited time and funding. This dissertation used a quasi-experimental study design to evaluate the bystander behavior intervention at JCHS. The methods of concept mapping and cognitive interviews were used to develop the survey items (Beatty & Willis, 2007; Kane & Trochim, 2006). Internal consistency of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the factor structure. Difference-in-difference methods were used to evaluate the program impact (Wooldridge, 2009), and path analysis was used to examine the factors that drive bystander behaviors (DeVellis, 1991). First, the EFA identified that bystander behavioral intentions to prevent dating violence represented a uni-dimensional factor structure with strong factor loadings and internal consistency. Second, using the difference-in-difference method, results showed a positive increase in bystander behaviors before and after the intervention after adjusting for potential confounders. No significant changes were found for bystander intentions, self-efficacy, social norms, or attitudes pre- and post-intervention. Third, results from the multivariate path analysis model show that bystander intentions do not mediate the relationship between self-efficacy, social norms, and attitudes and bystander behaviors, as hypothesized by the Integrated Behavioral Model (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010). However, results suggest that self-efficacy has a moderately strong direct relationship to bystander behaviors. These findings show that a less resource intensive intervention can increase bystander behaviors to prevent dating violence. However, more research is needed to understand the drivers of bystander behaviors, which will help programs target their interventions more effectively in the future.

T1  - Browse to search, visualize to explore: Who needs an alternative information retrieving model?
AN  - 1709217558; 2014-41039-017
AB  - This article presents the results of the evaluation of SCIViS – a visualization-based scientific information retrieval (IR) system. SCIViS is based on the logic of concept maps and enables the visualization of relationships among descriptors and authors of scientific papers. It creates an interactive interface between the user’s cognitive space and document information space. The system was evaluated by the group of 138 psychology students which have performed a variety of search tasks, using both the classic text-based and the visualization based IR systems. The SCIViS model has proved to be effective and intuitive. Participants were more efficient using the visual IR system, particularly when performing tasks requiring modifications of the initial query and finding alternative keywords. User responses indicated that system’s speed and ease of use are the most important attributes of the overall assessment. They also revealed the impact of users’ previous experience with IR systems on users’ satisfaction and perception of usefulness. Previous experience may be regarded both as the rate of success in performing search tasks, as well as the familiarity with popular search engines. The later one seems to be an important factor in modeling users’ information seeking behavior and their attitudes toward alternative IR models.

T1  - Science language wanted alive: Through the dialectical/dialogical lens of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle
AN  - 1648597091; 2014-37452-003
AB  - Over the past two decades, science educators increasingly have become interested in the role of language in the learning of science and have drawn on the work of Bakhtin, among others, for understanding the dialogical nature of knowledge in a sociocultural framework. However, the nature of language and its relation to thinking have not substantially changed and, in many ways, are incommensurable with the cultural–historical, materialist dialectical underpinning of the original framing of the sociocultural and dialogical approaches in the theories of L. S. Vygotsky and M. M. Bakhtin and his circle (e.g., V. N. Vološinov). Most importantly, currently available analyses of science classroom talk do not appear to exhibit sufficient appreciation of the fact that words, statements, and language are living phenomena, that is, they inherently change in speaking. In this paper, I begin by working out the premise that language is a living phenomenon that changes in use. I then present two key insights on language‐in‐use that derive from the works of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle, which are used to develop a theoretical and methodological frame. These key insights and the theoretical aspects of this paper are exemplified with materials from a concept mapping session in a 12th‐grade physics course. The proposed model has considerable implications for theorizing the relation between classroom talk and formal written genres of expression, and gives rise to many new research questions.

T1  - Development of the scientific imagination model: A concept-mapping perspective
AN  - 1703294090; 2014-33223-013
AB  - This study aimed to follow up on the research conducted by Ho, Wang, and Cheng (2013) and to develop a model of the scientific imagination using group concept mapping. Participants included five outstanding elementary school teachers and four researchers from southern Taiwan. The framework developed by Trochim (1989) was used as the basis for the construction of concept mappings of the scientific imagination through five panel discussions among the experts. A review of the literature, qualitative interviews, classroom observation, and document analyses were performed on group concept mapping, and independent relevant documents were used for data validation. A qualitative method was employed for data analysis. Finally, we developed the personality, developmental process, picture-in-mind, and surroundings (3PS) model of scientific imagination. Research results indicated that the scientific imagination model not only enhanced understanding of scientific imagination but also applied to daily experiences. The results of the present study are relevant to future projects and research in this domain, including the development of academic-based checklists to foster scientific imagination, the establishment of appropriate assessment tools, and the formulation of a specific curriculum for teaching the concept of scientific imagination.

T1  - Ethnically diverse students' knowledge structures in first‐semester organic chemistry
AN  - 1560635162; 2014-28806-001
AB  - Chemistry courses remain a challenge for many undergraduate students. In particular, first‐semester organic chemistry has been labeled as a gatekeeper with high attrition rates, especially among students of color. Our study examines a key factor related to conceptual understanding in science and predictive of course outcomes—knowledge structures. Previous research on knowledge structures has focused on differences between experts and novices. Given the increasing ethnic diversity of college classrooms and research indicating unique differences in certain higher order cognitive processes associated cultural practices and ethnicity, it is important to investigate whether similar patterns exist with respect to knowledge structures. Our study utilized concept maps to measure knowledge structures. Two separate analyses where performed to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students' organize their knowledge of organic chemistry content in structurally different ways. The first analysis utilized concept map proposition scoring to examine the influence of prior science achievement and ethnicity on knowledge structures. The second analysis examined holistic map structures to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students show qualitatively distinct structures overall. Results show significant mean differences on concept map proposition scores related to both prior science achievement and ethnic group membership. However, examination of holistic structures revealed that students' qualitative holistic structures did not vary by ethnic group membership. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in students' knowledge structures are related to prior science achievement across ethnic groups, not qualitative differences in the ways ethnically diverse students' structure knowledge. Implications for teaching and learning in organic chemistry are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Cognitive analysis of experts’ and novices’ concept mapping processes: An eye tracking study
AN  - 1555963155; 2014-24398-011
AB  - The goal of this study was to explore how designated experts (subject experts with extensive experience in science education and concept mapping) and novices (pre-service teachers) establish concept map (CM) development processes while considering their cognitive processes. Two experiments were conducted in which eye-tracking, written, and verbal data were collected from 29 novices and 6 subject matter experts. The results showed that despite some similar strategies, novices and experts followed different patterns during the CM development process. Both experts and novices embraced deductive reasoning and preferred hierarchical type CMs. Additional points studied during the process include filling out requested information in different orders, branch construction pattern, content richness and progress pattern. Furthermore, eye behavior patterns also differed among experts and novices. Expert participants differed from novices in all eye behavior metrics (fixation count, fixation and visit duration for specific actions). Novices’ fixation count (FC) numbers were higher than the experts’ during the entire process and in specific periods. In conclusion, these pattern differences affect the CM development process directly. Considering the patterns revealed in the study may help instructors guide learners more adequately and effectively. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - What do pre-service physics teachers know and think about concept mapping?
AN  - 1619503540; 2014-39540-009
AB  - In order to use concept maps in physics classes effectively, teachers’ knowledge and ideas about concept mapping are as important as the physics knowledge used in mapping. For this reason, we aimed to examine pre-service physics teachers’ knowledge on concept mapping, their ideas about the implementation of concept mapping in physics classes, the hidden elements influencing their ideas, and the relations between knowledge and ideas, qualitatively. The participants of this study were eight pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the physics education department at two state universities. The results of the interviews conducted with the participants and their artifacts revealed that although pre-service physics teachers had basic knowledge about concept mapping, they had some negative ideas about implementation in physics classes. Furthermore, language, limitation in assessment, limitation in expressions, and teacher’s knowledge were identified as the sources of pre-service physics teachers’ negative ideas.

T1  - Environmental education on climate change in a botanical garden: Adolescents’ knowledge, attitudes and conceptions
AN  - 1547272989; 2014-08881-008
AB  - Summary of a study that aimed at comprehensively examining the effectiveness of a specially designed climate change education program with regard to various factors. The program was conducted in a botanical garden located in the South of Germany. Overall, 114 students, 14–19 years of age, took part in the study. Combining a multiple- choice knowledge test, a psychometric questionnaire and concept maps in a prepost- follow up design, findings demonstrated (1) participants’ knowledge increased persistently; (2) connectedness with nature increased although the change was not persistent; (3) environmental attitudes changed positively, though only utilization attitudes were changed persistently and (4) the conceptions about climate change shifted towards a more scientific view while inclusion of students preconceptions into the learning material provided proved to be beneficial for this change.

T1  - Assessing science reasoning and conceptual understanding in the primary grades using standardized and performance-based assessments
AN  - 1526137075; 2014-11011-005
AB  - Project Clarion, a Jacob K. Javits-funded project, focused on the scale-up of primary-grade science curricula. Curriculum units, based on an Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM), were developed for high-ability learners, but tried out with all students in Title I settings to study the efficacy of the units with all learners. The units focus on the development of students’ conceptual understanding to undergird science content attainment. Teaching and learning models, such as concept formation and concept mapping were used to scaffold science learning and reasoning for appropriate curriculum differentiation. Science content mastery was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reasoning skills were measured using the Test of Critical Thinking. Understanding of macro-concepts and content attainment were measured by curriculum-embedded performance-based assessments. Students with the ICM outperformed students without the specialized curriculum in science content and reasoning skills, and showed greater growth in both conceptual understanding and content attainment.

T1  - Ninth graders' learning differences in a healthful-living curriculum
AN  - 1466097597; 2013-42999-001
AB  - Physical education and health education are relevant avenues for adolescents to learn knowledge and behavior related to energy-balanced living. Grounded in the 
framework theory of conceptual change, this study examined ninth graders' energy balance knowledge (i.e., concepts, principles, and strategies underlying the scientific mechanism and the outcome of energy balanced/imbalanced living) and physical activity in a healthful-living curriculum (i.e. combination of physical education and health). The students (
N = 195) were measured using concept mapping, accelerometers, and three-day physical activity recall. It was found that the students differed in energy balance knowledge where most (83%) lacked a higher-order relational understanding. Physical activity in physical education class or after school did not significantly differ by students'mental model levels concerning energy balance knowledge. The findings suggest that an ecological learning context with moderate physical activity should be provided to help students make sense of energy balance knowledge through lived experiences.

T1  - Cognitive structural change and the technological design process
AN  - 1641026069; 2014-99230-595
AB  - With increasing challenges from international competition and domestic demands for a technologically literate workforce, pressure is growing on the educational system to produce students that are literate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Integrative STEM education utilizes design-based pedagogical approaches to teach science/math content and practices concurrently with technology/engineering content and practices (Wells & Ernst, 2012, para. 2). The discipline of technology education has traditionally implemented design-based pedagogical approaches. However, the discipline has not demonstrated through empirical research that its existence and pedagogies are beneficial to student learning and cognition (Lewis, 1999, 2006; Petrina, 1998; Wells, 2008, 2010; Zuga, 1994, 1997, 2001). The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the technological design-based approach to teaching biotechnology literacy supports students' connections of science and technology concepts. Grounded in Ausubel's (1968) theory on meaningful learning and Novak's (1980) advanced organizer of concept mapping, this study examined evidence of high school students' cognitive structural change throughout the technological design-based approach to instruction. At three key intervals throughout the technological design process, students developed concept maps to document their understanding of the biology and technology concepts presented within the instructional materials. Data for this study included the students' constructed concept maps. To analyze the concept maps, the researcher used Hay et al.'s (2008) three-method analysis for measuring the quality of students' learning, and a qualitative analysis. Data analysis across all four methods indicated that all participants experienced a varying degree of growth in biology, technology, and integrative concepts and connections. Collectively this study supports the notion that the technological design-based approach to instruction does indeed (1) encourage meaningful learning, and (2) increase students' use of higher order thinking indicated by their abilities to demonstrate their use of schematic and strategic knowledge within their concept maps. The results of this study have direct implications within the areas of Technology Education, Science Education, classroom practice, and concept mapping. The discussion and implications suggest the need to expand the research conducted within this study, and to improve the methods for concept mapping analysis.

T1  - On the role of concept mapping assessments in today's constructivist classroom
AN  - 1641026017; 2014-99230-163
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the use of concept map assessments in freshman level general chemistry courses. Two strategies were employed in this study. The first strategy involved the creation of a web based concept mapping program capable of scoring concept maps drawn by students. The second strategy involved comparing different methods of scoring concept maps. Students enrolled in web based general chemistry course drew concept maps using the web based Concept Map Assessment Tool, CMAT. The reliability of the automated scoring in the CMAT program was tested by scoring the concept maps created in the CMAT program by hand. The results of the study indicated that scoring concept maps by hand was the same as the automated scoring of concept maps in the CMAT program. Two characteristics of concept maps serve as the basis for scoring methods. The relational character of a concept map is defined as the correctness of the propositions in the concept map. The structural character of a concept map is defined as the key features of the map, such as branches, long chains or intersecting points. The scoring method used in the CMAT program scores the relational aspects of a concept map. In this study, a second relational scoring method was used to score the concept maps drawn by students using the CMAT program, and the two sets of scores were compared. A novel structural scoring method, the Structural Complexity Index (SCI), was developed compared to the relational scoring approach of the CMAT program. The results of this study found the two relational scoring methods to score concept maps similarly under certain conditions. The SCI was found to produce a different score for concept maps than the relational scoring method employed by CMAT. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of student-led and teacher-led advance organizers on students' achievement and motivation of high school biology students
AN  - 1627957348; 2014-99210-497
AB  - The purpose of this research study was to explore what effects student-led and teacher-led advance organizer's instruction had on students' achievement and motivation in a high school biology class. The study used three advance organizers - Venn diagrams, concept maps, and KWL charts. There was a total of 83 students who participated in this study, and were enrolled in four sections of high school biology. The students were divided into two groups using systematic matching and received different advance organizer's instruction. Two groups received student-led instruction using cooperative learning, whereas, the other two groups received teacher-led instruction. Each group received a pretest, Advance Organizer Motivation Survey, weekly advance organizer-based lessons and weekly advance organizer evaluations for six weeks, posttest, and Advance Organizer Motivation Survey. Pretest and posttest scores on the biology exam, weekly objective quizzes, and presurvey and postsurvey scores on the Advance Organizer Motivation Survey were collected. Statistical analyses found no overall statistically significant difference in achievement between groups. When looking at achievement results for redundant organizers it was found that the student-led group had a higher mean than the teacher-led group when working with concept maps. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference in students' motivation to learn and motivation to participate in student-led activities between groups. The student-led group reported higher motivation than the teacher-led group. In regard to motivation and kinds of advance organizers, Venn diagrams and concept maps showed a statistically significant difference between groups, with the student-led group possessing more motivated with those two kinds of advance organizers than the teacher-led group. Qualitative data were also collected through weekly advance organizer evaluations, Advance Organizer Motivation Survey, and focus groups. These data revealed that the student-led group was more motivated to participate in the activity than the teacher-led group and that the student-led group preferred using Venn diagrams while the teacher-led group preferred using KWL charts.

T1  - Assessing conceptual knowledge for the physics of semiconductors
AN  - 1606044577; 2014-99161-060
AB  - Following the trend in science and engineering education generated by the visible impact created by the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), the investigator developed a Physics of Semiconductors Concept Inventory (PSCI). PSCI fills the need of standardized concept tests for undergraduate education in photonics and electrical engineering. The structure of the PSCI test followed a concept map reflecting the input from a panel of experts from different universities and from a survey of textbooks currently used in engineering schools in the United States. Based on the statistical analysis of the scores and response patterns, the test was calibrated as an instrument to measure participants' cognitive ability independent of items' difficulty. The models employed were the Rasch Model and the Rasch Partial Credit Model. The estimation procedure employed was Conditional Maximum Likelihood. The analysis was carried on using algorithms written in the open-source language R. The current PSCI BETA test contains eighteen calibrated items covering six concepts of the physics of semiconductors. PSCI BETA may be used for three purposes: individual student diagnostic if applied at the beginning of a physics of semiconductors course; predictor for students' academic performance in the field of semiconductors if applied at the end of instruction; assessment instrument for instructional strategies if applied both for pre- and post-instruction. The PSCI BETA instrument can be applied in any English speaking college setting. The main results of the PSCI research are: ranking persons' ability related to the physics of semiconductors on an objective linear scale, building a diagnose matrix that may be utilized by instructors for choosing an optimal teaching approach and by students for remediation, and demonstrating a calibration method for small sample size.

T1  - Effective use of multimedia presentations to maximize learning within high school science classrooms
AN  - 1536026347; 2014-99110-522
AB  - This research used an evidenced-based experimental 2 x 2 factorial design General Linear Model with Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (RMANCOVA). For this analysis, time served as the within-subjects factor while treatment group (i.e., static and signaling, dynamic and signaling, static without signaling, and dynamic without signaling) served as the between-subject independent variable. Three dependent variables were used to assess learner outcomes: (a) a 14 multiple-choice pre and post-test to measure knowledge retention, (b) a pre and post-test concept map to measure synthesis and structure of knowledge, and (c) four questions based on a Likert scale asking students to rank the cognitive difficulty of understanding four aspects of the animation they engaged in. A mental rotations test was used in the pretest conditions to establish a control and used as a covariate. The treatment contained a four minute and 53 second animation that served as an introductory multimedia presentation explaining the gravitational effects of the moon and sun on the earth. These interactions occur at predictable times and are responsible for creating the tidal effects experienced on Earth. There were 99 volunteer high school participants enrolled in science classes randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. The research was conducted to determine how motion and the principle of signaling, established in The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning affected precollege learners. The experiment controlled for modality, segmenting, temporal contiguity, redundancy, and navigational control. Results of the RMANCOVA indicated statistical significance for the within subjects effect: over time for all participants, with time and knowledge retention measured from the multiple-choice results, and in the category 
quality of concepts represented in the concept map analysis. However, there were no significant differences in the between groups analysis for knowledge retention based on the multiple-choice assessment, or among groups over time in the concept map variables 
number of concepts, levels, and 
quality of concepts. Additionally, when measuring cognitive difficulty when learning from the animations, no significant differences were measured. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Understanding environmental sustainability as a complex system: Use of an agent-based participatory watershed simulation
AN  - 1519510366; 2014-99070-385
AB  - Understanding the functions and properties of complex systems is necessary for participants pursuing education and careers in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) because the fundamental constructs of complex systems apply across many domains and are at the heart of the solutions to many global issues facing the world today (National Science Foundation, 2009). Complex systems understanding has been a persistently difficult set of concepts for participants to learn and the science community, despite years of effort, has been unsuccessful in achieving complex systems understanding at the undergraduate level. There is a need for new technologies to be developed to help improve the way complex systems understanding happens and evidence that agent-based simulations can be an effective learning tool in this context. The purpose of this study was to examine complex systems understanding with the use of an agent-based simulation called the UVA Bay Game. Using a mixed methods, cross-case analysis, this exploratory study examined how undergraduate participants in three separate courses experienced changes in complex systems understanding with the use of the UVA Bay Game through the development of concept maps and written reflections on their learning. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre and post-simulation concept maps, this study supported an overall positive increase of complex systems understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Understanding how participants experience an increase in complex systems understanding with the use of a particular agent-based simulation will help us better understand how learning happens in this context and how we best design simulations to maximize participant learning outcomes.

T1  - A design-based approach to teaching sustainability
AN  - 1515991478; 2014-99051-085
AB  - We live on a finite ecological system, yet consume as though resources are unlimited. Current environmental data suggests many in the developed world are living beyond what the earth is able to sustain. The paradigms in which we operate continue to support a path of constant consumption that continues to exacerbate this problem. Technology educators can and should play a valuable role in working with students to question these paradigms through lessons that begin to engage students toward thinking about a more sustainable future. Design-based instruction provides a framework for instructional practices that allows students to build problem-solving and critical thinking skills as they begin to understand deeper concepts related to sustainability. This study examined middle school students' understanding of sustainability after completing a design based unit. The study evaluated student work, concept maps, observations and pre-and post-tests to determine student understanding of sustainability. Instruction involved aspects of problem-based learning, design education and the use of technology. Students were given an authentic problem of designing a sustainable home. As part of the design process, students conducted research on the factors and specific design components that would make a home sustainable. The main question guiding this study was "How can a home design project impact middle school students' understanding and appreciation of sustainability?" The findings suggest students demonstrated significant growth in understanding concepts of sustainability and were able to apply sustainable concepts in their designs. Eighty percent of students were able to meet or exceed rubric expectations on explaining the importance of sustainability. All of the students also demonstrated considerable growth in the understanding and application of sustainable solutions to their designs. They were able to propose authentic solutions to the problem and apply their research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A descriptive study of pre-service science teachers' conceptual understanding of scientific inquiry using concept maps
AN  - 1511552831; 2014-99050-144
AB  - Future science teachers serve a critical role in creating a scientifically literate citizenry. Their knowledge and understanding of the process by which science works, scientific inquiry, is fundamental to this goal of science education. This descriptive research study investigated pre-service secondary science teachers' conceptual understanding of scientific inquiry using concept maps. Thirty participants constructed concept maps describing the interrelationships among twelve scientific inquiry concepts. The concept maps were analyzed to determine how participants structured, organized, associated, and described the relationships between these concepts. The majority of participants did organize and associate a chain of inquiry concepts with one another into a scientific method series. Participants displayed an overall low number of associations between the twelve inquiry concepts. Of the concept pairs that were associated with one another, there was a lack of consistency in the linking words used to describe the relationship between them. Implications for science educators in the development and design of teaching about inquiry in pre-service teacher education programs and professional development opportunities are examined. Recommendations for further study into the conceptual understanding of beginning science teachers are also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Formation of novice business students' mental models through simulation gaming
AN  - 1492675727; 2014-00996-006
AB  - Studies on students’ perceptions of learning in business simulations often suggest that students like simulations and view them more positively than both lectures and case discussions. However, research on the actual learning outcomes deriving from participating in business simulations still needs to be pursued. Consequently, the purpose of this case-study article is to examine how a business simulation game contributes to the cognitive learning of novices in business studies. We describe the use of a clock-driven business simulation for teaching 133 novices in business studies at the University of Turku, Finland. The students’ cognitive learning was evaluated based on data generated by pre- and post-game concept map tests designed to illustrate the formation and change of mental models during the simulation course. The results of this study suggest that simulation games can provide a solid basis for novice learning. They help to increase comprehension of the complexity of business organizations and the various processes, transactions, and operations involved.

T1  - Tracing knowledge co-evolution in a realistic course setting: A wiki-based field experiment
AN  - 1461651316; 2013-38595-006
AB  - The co-evolution model of collaborative knowledge building by Cress and Kimmerle (2008) assumes that cognitive and social processes interact when users build knowledge with shared digital artifacts. While these assumptions have been tested in various lab experiments, a test under natural field conditions in educational settings has not been conducted. Here, we present a field experiment where we triggered knowledge co-evolution in an accommodation and an assimilation condition, and measured effects on student knowledge building outside the laboratory in the context of two university courses. Therefore, 48 students received different kinds of prompts that triggered external accommodation and assimilation while writing a wiki text. Knowledge building was measured with a content analysis of the students’ texts and comments (externalization), and with concept maps and association tests (internalization). The findings reveal that (a) different modes of externalization (accommodation and assimilation) could be triggered with prompts, (b) across both conditions, this externalization co-occurred with internalization (student learning), and (c) there is some evidence that external assimilation and accommodation had differential effects on internal assimilation and accommodation. Thus, the field experiment supports the assumptions of the co-evolution model in a realistic course setting. On a more general note, the study provides an example of how wikis can be used successfully for collaborative knowledge building within educational contexts.

T1  - A concept map-embedded educational computer game for improving students' learning performance in natural science courses
AN  - 1461651162; 2013-38595-011
AB  - Many recent studies have reported the benefits of educational computer games in promoting students’ learning motivations. On the other hand, however, the effect of digital game-based learning in improving students’ learning performance has been questioned. Several previous studies have reported that without properly integrating learning strategies into gaming scenarios, the effectiveness of educational computer games could be limited, or may be even worse than that of the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In this study, a concept map-embedded gaming approach is proposed for developing educational computer games by integrating concept mapping as part of the gaming scenarios to help students organize what they have learned during the game-based learning process. Moreover, a role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school natural science course based on the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the concept map-embedded gaming approach can significantly improve the students’ learning achievement and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach revealed a significantly higher degree of perceived usefulness than those who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach.

T1  - Can elementary students gather information from concept maps?
AN  - 1542014647; 2014-02047-004
AB  - In this study, we investigated whether concept maps were used as often and as effectively in elementary science and technology classrooms as recommended by the National Ministry of Education (MEB) in the new curricula in Turkey. In the new elementary science and technology curricula, the MEB provides a general concept map for each unit. We used concept maps provided for the Light and Sound units for fourth, fifth, and sixth grades as content to determine whether students were able to use concept maps to gather information from them. Our analyses showed that most of the students did not use the concept maps to answer the questions. Rather they used their own knowledge and cognitive structures about light and sound to answer the questions. Therefore, we concluded that students do not know how to read the concept maps and gather knowledge from them. Also, we ran an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to explore whether grade level has an effect on students' performance in reading the concept maps and gathering information from them. We found that grade level has a significant effect on students' performance in using concept maps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using a concept map knowledge management system to enhance the learning of biology
AN  - 1459338312; 2013-34096-012
AB  - This study was undertaken with the goal of developing a Concept Map Knowledge Management System (CMKMS) for use as a tool in observing change in a student’s understanding of biology concepts over time. The CMKMS should be useful in assessing the extent of a student’s knowledge and in revealing their unique thought processes. The study was concerned not only with a student’s self-evaluation of learning but also with their level of satisfaction after using the CMKMS. The CMKMS combines the diagnosis of concept mapping with the style of thought processing, and promotes teaching activities step-by-step, in order to promote effective student learning. In analyzing the factors that influence the effect of teaching, the teacher can determine a student’s knowledge structure and highlight misconceptions by inspecting the concept maps and logs. The results of this study show that knowledge management involved in computer-aided instruction in the teaching of biology had a positive influence on learning effectiveness. The CMKMS also was useful in promoting the student’s thought processing, creativity, and ability to judge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Self‐regulated learning study strategies and academic performance in undergraduate organic chemistry: An investigation examining ethnically diverse students
AN  - 1459339285; 2013-26547-004
AB  - This study sought to identify ethnically diverse students’ study strategies in organic chemistry and their relationships to course outcomes. Study diaries, concept maps, and problem sets were used to assess study outcomes. Findings show that students engage in four commonly used reviewing-type strategies, regardless of ethnic group affiliation. However, these common strategies were rarely associated with students’ problem solving, concept mapping, or course performance. In addition, students seldom engaged in metacognitive and peer learning strategies despite their reported benefits in the literature. Implications for research and practice are discussed in light of these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Analyzing change in students' gene‐to‐evolution models in college‐level introductory biology
AN  - 1459339119; 2013-26547-003
AB  - Research in contemporary biology has become increasingly complex and organized around understanding biological processes in the context of systems. To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised “Gene-to-Evolution” (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students’ ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

T1  - Effects of touch technology-based concept mapping on students' learning attitudes and perceptions
AN  - 1515992297; 2013-40971-021
AB  - Concept maps have become a widely used educational tool around the globe. The advancements in computerized interface technologies have enabled even more alternatives for using concept maps in teaching and learning. This study investigates the effects of two different touch technology-based concept mapping interaction modes on students' learning achievements and learning attitudes in a natural science course, as well as their degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn. Ninety two sixth graders were randomly divided into three groups. Experimental Group One was taught using the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB)-based concept mapping approach, Experimental Group Two learned with the touchscreen-based concept mapping approach, while the control group learned with the traditional paper-and-pencil-based concept mapping approach. The experimental results show that, in terms of learning attitudes toward the natural science course and the degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn, the students were significantly more positive about the two touch technology-based interaction modes than they were about the traditional paper-and-pencil mode.

T1  - An evaluation of the learning effectiveness of concept map-based science book reading via mobile devices
AN  - 1515992145; 2013-40971-013
AB  - Printed books have long been an important means for people to obtain knowledge; nevertheless, educators have pointed out problems of learning from some printed books, in particular, the lack of learning supports, such as supplementary materials and learning guiding tools. In this study, a concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is proposed for supporting printed science book reading activities for children via mobile devices with QR-code facilities. A quasi-experiment has been conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 92 sixth graders participated. The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is significantly more helpful to the students in reading printed books than traditional book reading and the conventional ubiquitous learning approach in terms of learning achievements; moreover, the students had a high level of acceptance of such a mobile technology-assisted learning system in terms of “ease of use”, “usefulness” and "attitude and intention of future use.” (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - This study investigates the effect of a shared concept-mapping task on high school students’ learning about kinematics in a collaborative simulation-based inquiry setting. Pairs of students were randomly assigned to a concept-mapping condition (12 pairs) or a control condition (13 pairs). Students in the concept-mapping condition had a computer-supported collaborative concept-mapping tool that aimed to integrate concepts and propositions. Students in the control condition used the same learning environment without the concept-mapping tool. Students’ interactions with each other and with the simulation were tracked by log files. Learning was assessed with tests of intuitive and structural knowledge and a proposition test. Students in the concept-mapping condition exchanged significantly more chat messages related to experimentation, interpretation, and drawing conclusions and were more engaged in integration-oriented consensus building, which regression analysis showed to be positively related to learning gains for both intuitive and structural knowledge. Students in the concept-mapping condition outperformed their peers on the intuitive and structural knowledge tests. These results suggest that concept maps can positively influence consensus-building activities and learning in a collaborative inquiry-learning setting. The findings of the current study thereby contribute to the ongoing debate about (shared) graphical representations as scaffolds for collaborative learning.

T1  - Mapping changes in science teachers' content knowledge: Concept maps and authentic professional development
AN  - 1440035332; 2013-17702-005
AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Incorporating concept mapping in project-based learning: Lessons from watershed investigations
AN  - 1440034844; 2013-17702-012
AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers’ convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students’ vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers’ use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool.

T1  - Effective self-regulated science learning through multimedia-enriched skeleton concept maps
AN  - 1508426777; 2013-15969-002
AB  - Background: This study combines work on concept mapping with scripted collaborative learning. Purpose: The objective was to examine the effects of self-regulated science learning through scripting students’ argumentative interactions during collaborative ‘multimedia-enriched skeleton concept mapping’ on meaningful science learning and retention. Programme description: Each concept in the enriched skeleton concept map (ESCoM) contained annotated multimedia-rich content (pictures, text, animations or video clips) that elaborated the concept, and an embedded collaboration script to guide students’ interactions. Sample: The study was performed in a Biomolecules course on the Bachelor of Applied Science program in the Netherlands. All first-year students (N = 93, 31 women, 62 men, aged 17–33 years) took part in this study. Design and methods: The design used a control group who received the regular course and an experimental group working together in dyads on an ESCoM under the guidance of collaboration scripts. In order to investigate meaningful understanding and retention, a retention test was administered a month after the final exam. Results: Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant experimental effect on the Biomolecules exam scores between the experimental group and the control, and the difference between the groups on the retention test also reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping resulted in meaningful understanding and retention of the conceptual structure of the domain, the concepts, and their relations. Not only was scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping more effective than the traditional teaching approach, it was also more efficient in requiring far less teacher guidance.

T1  - The effectiveness of concept maps in teaching physics concepts applied to engineering education: Experimental comparison of the amount of learning achieved with and without concept maps
AN  - 1417861244; 2013-09363-008
AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E.G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C.G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E.G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C.G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E.G. students as compared with the C.G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E.G. students’ learning was greater than 19 percentage points.

T1  - Concept mapping enhances learning of biochemistry
AN  - 1611626025; 2014-27465-001
AB  - Background: Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Methods: Participants were first year medical students (
n = 150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Results: Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, 
p < 0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). Conclusion: The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry.

T1  - Concept maps provide a window onto preservice elementary teachers’ knowledge in the teaching and learning of mathematics
AN  - 1544982359; 2014-19825-003
AB  - This collaborative concept-mapping exercise was conducted in a second-year mathematics methods course. Teachers’ visual representations of their mathematical content and pedagogical knowledge provided insight into their understanding of how students learn mathematics. We collected 28 preservice student teachers’ concept maps and analyzed them by counting the number of concepts and links within and across knowledge, teaching, and learning. We also examined the nature of the links between two domains of concepts. Preservice teachers revealed limited knowledge about how students learn mathematics. Concept maps successfully identified areas in which preservice teachers held an unsophisticated understanding of mathematics and its connection to pedagogy.

T1  - Students' perceptions, attitudes, and incorporation of demonstrations, popular media videos, and animations concerning chemical reactions
AN  - 1449318594; 2013-99191-024
AB  - Students often struggle with learning complex chemistry concepts. In today's society with the advances in multimedia technology, educators have a variety of tools available to help students learn these concepts. These tools include demonstrations, videos in the popular media, and animations; referred to collectively as multimethods. With the increase in possibilities educators must consider a variety of factors, the most important of which is their students. An examination of the literature leaves questions regarding the views of students as well as the impact of these tools on student learning. This study qualitatively explores student perceptions and attitudes regarding each of these multimethods using open-ended surveys, worksheets, interviews, and audio recordings. Concept maps and drawings provide insight into how students incorporate information from these multimethods into their understanding of chemical reactions. The results of the study emphasize variety for student perceptions, attitudes, conceptions, and the way they incorporate information from the multimethods. However, there also were trends in that the majority of students preferred demonstrations and the macro level. The students appeared to be aware that the use of these multimethods is designed to help them learn. Student drawings and concept maps additionally indicate a lack of understanding of the nature of chemical reactions and a failure to incorporate the information in a substantial way. Finally, implications for teaching are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Investigating the nature of third grade students' experiences with concept maps to support learning of science concepts
AN  - 1442391020; 2013-99170-452
AB  - To support and improve effective science teaching, educators need methods to reveal student understandings and misconceptions of science concepts and to offer all students an opportunity to reflect on their own knowledge construction and organization. Students can benefit by engaging in scientific activities in which they build personal connections between what they learn and their own experiences. Integrating student-constructed digital concept mapping into the science curriculum can reveal to both students and teachers the conceptual organization and understanding of science content, which can assist in building connections between concepts and personal experiences. I used a qualitative case study research design in which my setting was one third-grade classroom. Participants were the teacher and student in this classroom. This paper describes how a class of third grade students used concept maps to understand science concepts (specifically, "watershed systems"). During class discussions and interviews students revised concept map content and structure as their ideas developed. The results of this study demonstrated how students' understandings and misconceptions were revealed through their construction of digital concept maps over time. Each new concept map built upon the previous one for a total of seven maps per student. Analyses of the concept maps using an evaluative rubric revealed changes over time in concept map structure and content. A formal assessment of watershed concepts was administered four times during the course of the science unit. I conclude that my research model used for integrating concept maps in this science class enabled students to reflect deeply on their work and to accurately revise their knowledge construction and content. Using concept maps to inform her teaching, the teacher also made robust use of the research model. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Embedding evolution: Exploring changes in students' conceptual development, beliefs, and motivations in a population ecology unit
AN  - 1433268703; 2013-99150-219
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore student changes in conceptual development, epistemology, and motivations when evolution concepts are embedded and explicit reflective discourse is used in a unit for population ecology. The two research problems were: (1) What changes are observed in student's conceptual development, epistemology, and motivations when there is explicit reflective discourse within a population ecology unit with embedded evolution?, and (2) In what ways does explicit reflection influence students' mental models within a population ecology unit with embedded evolution? This mixed-method, quasi-experimental study assessed two regular high school biology classes in a small, urban, Midwestern high school. Students in this study had not studied evolution within any formal chapters, but had been immersed in a curriculum with embedded evolution. The study was conducted over a four-week period in a population ecology unit near the beginning of second semester. Instruction emphasized basic conceptions in population ecology. Five key intervention activities included evolutionary concepts as part of an embedded curriculum. The independent variable was explicit reflective discourse with one or two intervention questions after completion of these activities. Data included pre- and posttest surveys measuring (a) evolutionary understanding of natural selection, (b) science beliefs, and (c) science motivations. Written artifacts included (a) explanations to scenarios, (b) pre- and post-argument reflections revealing student's science beliefs and science motivations resultant from two argumentations, and (c) three, pre-, post-, and 6-week final concept maps constructed from 12 concepts. All data sources provided descriptive data. Conceptual change was interpreted from an ontological, epistemological, and motivational perspective. The experimental class receiving explicit reflective discourse showed greater overall increases in conceptual development. Students in both classes constructed teleological and proximate explanations. Overall, the experimental class gave greater numbers of evolutionary explanations. Scored propositions from concept maps showed a mixture of synthetic and scientific conceptions in both classes, however the experimental group showed greater scientific quality. Students in both classes exhibited direct-process ontology. Both classes had high degrees of epistemological and motivational commitments demonstrated by their engagement and subsequent improvements in conceptual development in both evolutionary and ecological conceptions.

T1  - Incorporating formative assessment and science content into elementary science methods---a case study
AN  - 1428018388; 2013-99131-133
AB  - Just as elementary students enter the science classroom with prior knowledge and experiences, so do preservice elementary teachers who enter the science methods classroom. Elementary science methods instructors recognize the challenges associated with preparing teachers for the science classroom. Two of these challenges include overcoming limited science content understanding and a low science teaching efficacy. Based upon research in science misconceptions, conceptual change theory, formative assessment, and science teaching efficacy, this design experiment explored the use of formative assessment in an authentic learning environment to address some of these challenges. As a case study, the goal was to identify two specific topics in science which the preservice teachers did not understand and to model consistent use of formative assessment to guide instruction in those science topics for six weeks. The research questions for this study sought to explore the design of the class while also exploring students' understanding of the science content and their understanding of formative assessment. One specific question was whether the formative data could differentiate between deeply held student misconceptions in science and incomplete science understanding. In addition, data was collected to measure changes in science teaching efficacy as well as preservice teachers' desire to use formative assessment in their own future classrooms. Based upon student interviews and a final content quiz, the participants in this study did show improved science content understanding in the areas of plant food/energy and plate tectonics. The course design implemented a variety of formative assessment tools including formative assessment probes, student science notebooks, student concept maps, a non-graded quiz, and more. The STEBI-B survey identified improved science teaching efficacy among the participants. Student final essays indicated improved understanding of formative assessment and students also expressed a desire to incorporate formative assessment into their future teaching. Final reflections on this case study recognize the value of formative assessment as a means for improved communication between students and teachers about student understanding in an effort to provide and model more effective science instruction.

T1  - Employment of an informal educational mathematical facility to lower math anxiety and improve teacher and student attitudes towards understanding mathematics
AN  - 1420147143; 2013-99111-396
AB  - Students do not pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) because of a lack of ability, but rather a lack of positive experiences with mathematics. Research has concluded that attitudes in math directly influence success in mathematics. As many as 75% of high school graduates in the United States suffer from mild to severe forms of math anxiety. The improvement of student achievement in mathematics in the United States lags behind that of many other nations in the world. Efforts to improve student achievement in mathematics have focused on developing effective teachers and teaching practices, creating state and national standards, and raising test scores. Advances in neuroscience and understanding how the brain learns mathematics are often not reflected in current instructional practices, and being "bad at math" is not viewed as a problem by American society. As a response to the current state of mathematics in the United States, the researcher created an informal educational center to provide positive mathematical experiences that demonstrate how math works. The Metamo4ic Math Center opened in 2007. This study investigated the effectiveness of a two-hour field trip visit to the Math Center on 114 elementary students, six teachers, and 42 preservice teachers. A Math Anxiety Scale - Revised (MAS-R) and knowledge concept map were administered to treatment and control groups pre-visit, post-visit, and post-post visit. Interviews were conducted pre and post visit. In addition, an independent evaluator observed each field trip visit. The results of the study indicated that the Math Center does significantly lessen anxiety and reduce negative attitudes toward mathematics in elementary students and their teachers. Although pre-service teachers demonstrated a lessening in anxiety, the decrease was not significant, and the results demonstrated that the pre-service teachers in both the treatment and control groups had anxiety levels significantly higher than the student and in-service teacher groups. This study led the researcher to conclude that a "Cycle of Anxiety" is contagious and continually perpetuated through the current instruction of mathematics. This study indicated that efforts to improve math achievement void of addressing negative attitudes and math anxiety might not be successful.

T1  - A study of urban African American students' conceptions of school and media science
AN  - 1373445441; 2013-99090-276
AB  - In order to inquire into the persistent underrepresentation of urban minority students in the sciences, this study explored three urban African American students' conceptualizations of school science and media science, with emphases on the representation of science in 
Crime Scene Investigation (
CSI). Based on the data collected from interviews, classroom observations, student journals, focus groups, concept maps, and artifacts, the study shows that the student participants conceptualize school science as a compilation of observed chemical reactions, utilizing specific laboratory apparatus, and laboratory experiments. The study also shows that student participants conceptualize media science as an accruement of evidence collection, observation, photography, analyses of evidence on and off site, and taking safety precautions. While the student participants did not find school science to be applicable in their daily lives, they believed that they had acquired usable and accurate scientific knowledge from media science. Two major themes emerged from the student participants' voices: student participants' acute awareness of their limited access to the scientific world, and student participants' inadequate accruement of scientific knowledge through school and media science. By attending to the student participants' voices, this study lends support to advocating for and developing culturally responsive pedagogy in science education that will facilitate urban students' active engagement and improve their achievement in science education.

T1  - Mapping biological ideas: Concept maps as knowledge integration tools for evolution education
AN  - 1322258641; 2013-99010-093
AB  - Many students leave school with a fragmented understanding of biology that does not allow them to connect their ideas to their everyday lives (Wandersee, 1989; Mintzes, Wandersee, & Novak, 1998; Mintzes, Wandersee, & Novak, 2000a). Understanding evolution ideas is seen as central to building an integrated knowledge of biology (Blackwell, Powell, & Dukes, 2003; Thagard & Findlay, 2010). However, the theory of evolution has been found difficult to understand as it incorporates a wide range of ideas from different areas (Bahar et al., 1999; Tsui & Treagust, 2003) and multiple interacting levels (Wilensky & Resnick, 1999; Duncan & Reiser, 2007; Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007). Research suggests that learners can hold a rich repertoire of co-existing alternative ideas of evolution (for example, Bishop & Anderson, 1990; Demastes, Good, & Peebles, 1996; Evans, 2008), especially of human evolution (for example, Nelson, 1986; Sinatra et al., 2003; Poling & Evans, 2004). Evolution ideas are difficult to understand because they often contradict existing alternative ideas (Mayr, 1982; Wolpert, 1994; Evans, 2008). Research suggests that understanding human evolution is a key to evolution education (for example, Blackwell et al., 2003; Besterman & Baggott la Velle, 2007). This dissertation research investigates how different concept mapping forms embedded in a collaborative technology-enhanced learning environment can support students' integration of evolution ideas using case studies of human evolution. Knowledge Integration (KI) (Linn et al., 2000; Linn et al., 2004) is used as the operational framework to explore concept maps as knowledge integration tools to elicit, add, critically distinguish, group, connect, and sort out alternative evolution ideas. Concept maps are a form of node-link diagram for organizing and representing connections between ideas as a semantic network (Novak & Gowin, 1984). This dissertation research describes the iterative development of a novel biology-specific form of concept map, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), which aims to help learners connect ideas across levels (for example, genotype and phenotype levels) towards an integrated understanding of evolution. Using a design-based research approach (Brown, 1992; Cobb et al., 2003), three iterative studies were implemented in ethically and economically diverse public high schools classrooms using the web-based inquiry science environment (WISE) (Linn et al., 2003; Linn et al., 2004). Study 1 investigates concept maps as generative assessment tools. Study 1A compares the concept map generation and critique process of biology novices and experts. Findings suggest that concept maps are sensitive to different levels of knowledge integration but require scaffolding and revision. Study 1B investigates the implementation of concept maps as summative assessment tools in a WISE evolution module. Results indicate that concept maps can reveal connections between students' alternative ideas of evolution. Study 2 introduces KIMs as embedded collaborative learning tools. After generating KIMs, student dyads revise KIMs through two different critique activities (comparison against an expert or peer generated KIM). Findings indicate that different critique activities can promote the use of different criteria for critique. Results suggest that the combination of generating and critiquing KIMs can support integrating evolution ideas but can be time-consuming. As time in biology classrooms is limited, study 3 distinguishes the learning effects from either generating or critiquing KIMs as more time efficient embedded learning tools. Findings suggest that critiquing KIMs can be more time efficient than generating KIMs. Using KIMs that include common alternative ideas for critique activities can create genuine opportunities for students to critically reflect on new and existing ideas.… (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Learning about bones at a science museum: Examining the alternate hypotheses of ceiling effect and prior knowledge
AN  - 1269431414; 2012-28705-005
AB  - Groups of children at a science museum were pre- and post-assessed with a type of concept map, known as personal meaning maps, to determine what new understandings, if any, they were gaining from participation in a series of structured hands-on activities about bones and the process of bones healing. Close examination was made regarding whether children’s prior knowledge or a ceiling effect was influencing results. Children made significant gains in vocabulary and concepts related to both bones and the bone healing process. Many children also demonstrated that their comprehension moved from a novice level to a transitional level of understanding. Prior to participation, children were more uniformly unacquainted with ideas about the healing process of bones than they were about bones; this led to more consistent learning gains related to the healing process. There was some indication of a ceiling effect occurring when children revealed what they had learned about bones, but not when they revealed what they had learned about the bone healing process. Although the prior knowledge theory was not statistically supported, data did show that children with greater understanding prior to the Busy Bones Lab activities end up with correspondingly greater understanding. This suggests that addressing concepts related to bones prior to a lab experience may bring more children to a higher level of understanding before engaging in the lab experience.

T1  - The roles of embedded monitoring requests and questions in improving mental models of computer-based scientific text
AN  - 1033449376; 2012-17714-018
AB  - Prior research has shown that people are likely to skim information presented digitally with the resultant deleterious effect on accurate mental models of the text. Teaching monitoring strategies and presenting text with adjunct questions are effective strategies for improving the mental models of readers of scientific text, but the two strategies have not been directly compared for studying text read from a computer screen. In the present study, participants were individually tested in two experiments in which they studied computer-based text on the heart and circulatory system while either reading the text with no interruption, answering adjunct inference questions, answering adjunct factual questions, or answering prompts for global or specific monitoring. Reading time was untimed but looking back was not available. Prompting for global monitoring was most effective for improvement of mental models as measured by scores in diagram drawing, concept map construction, factual memory, and generating inferences. Further, global monitoring did not require more time-on-task than the other methods. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - ‘Structural transformation’ as a threshold concept in university teaching
AN  - 1023199951; 2012-13574-011
AB  - In an attempt to reveal potential threshold concepts in the field of higher education pedagogy, groups of university teachers (in the UK and in Panama) were encouraged to develop personal reflection upon their conceptions of teaching. This was initiated through concept mapping activities. It was hoped that this would help participants to address the perceived differences of teaching between their disciplines whilst coming to recognise the generic factors that may be applicable to teaching across the university context. Consideration of emergent personal models allowed the authors to identify common themes across the disciplines and to align this to established learning theories that may act as a baseline for comparison. The emergent generic model was a modification of Kolb’s learning cycle in which two learning cycles (one for the student and one for the teacher) are linked by the shared concrete experience of the classroom and considered in the context of knowledge structures. The transformation of the morphology of these knowledge structures (oscillating between linear and hierarchical) is seen as fundamental to the successful negotiation of the cycle. The participants’ recognition of this structural transformation is proposed as a threshold concept for the evolution of university teaching. Personal models are described here in relation to the double Kolb cycle to illustrate the potential of this approach to stimulate discussion about university teaching that may encourage a transformation in perspective from delivery and receipt of content towards structural transformation of content.

T1  - Joined up thinking? Evaluating the use of concept‐mapping to develop complex system learning
AN  - 1018476110; 2012-10159-007
AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill‐structured and interconnected. Concept‐mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill‐structured. Evaluations of concept‐mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade‐point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis’ Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept‐mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - International perspectives on problem-based learning: Contexts, cultures, challenges, and adaptations
AN  - 1324548147; 2012-29191-002
AB  - The theme of this special issue is timely as the world becomes increasingly flat and globally connected. By focusing on an international perspective in problem-based learning (PBL), it puts culture squarely in the center, whether it is a national or disciplinary culture. The articles in this special issue represent Thailand, South Africa, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They represent disciplines that include engineering, business, hotel administration, social studies, and sport and exercise physiology. Student populations range from secondary school to postgraduate. It is clear from this collection that PBL serves diverse student populations who have differing needs. Some of the articles discuss the challenges that learners face, in particular, learning to do PBL, whether a result of prior knowledge, language, or experiences in schooling. A consistent theme throughout the special issue is that there are different models of PBL adapted to their local contexts and cultures. Another theme that permeated these studies was a notion of distributed scaffolding. The facilitator provides one important source of scaffolding, but several of these studies used other scaffolds as well—through structuring the problem, providing worksheets, creating concept maps (e.g., the Zwaal & Otting study), or encouraging multiple perspectives (as in Smith & Cook study’s use of the Six Thinking Hats). The two big themes that jump out of this special issue are the need to adapt to local contexts, whether that is cultural or disciplinary contexts. Together, this set of papers demonstrates that PBL is being used in a wide range of disciplines by an international PBL community. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept development and meaningful learning among electrical engineering students engaged in a problem-based laboratory experience
AN  - 1240220806; 2012-23927-002
AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject’s body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - What is a doctorate? A concept-mapped analysis of process versus product in the supervision of lab-based PHDS
AN  - 1001921653; 2012-06251-002
AB  - Background: Concept-mapping and interview techniques are used to track knowledge and understanding over the duration of PhD study amongst four students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards their PhDs. This work is in contrast to much PhD supervision research and policy research that focuses on supervisory styles and roles and may decontextualise the topic and disciplinary setting. Purpose: The work investigates the understanding of the process and product in PhD-level research and supervision. Sample: Participants were four students and their supervisor(s). Case studies were based on longitudinal studies conducted over three to four years (the duration of a PhD). The students were all enrolled in lab-based PhDs in one UK-based higher education institution. Three of the four students were international (one EU-based) and three supervisors were from outside the UK. Design and methods: The data provide documentary evidence of the ways in which these supervisors act to facilitate learning and discovery of research processes and an understanding of lab-based science research supervision. In the initial interview (conducted separately with students and supervisors), the interviewee constructed two maps, one on the topic of the PhD and one on the process of a PhD. In subsequent interviews, the student or supervisor reviewed and updated the previously constructed maps. Transcripts of the interviews were made as well. These data draw on 72 interviews and 96 unique concept maps constructed. The challenges of a PhD being both a process of learning (for the student and the supervisor) and a product of a research project are explored using case study analysis of these four pairs. Findings and discussion: Analyses of the collected data suggested that the students focused more on the product of a PhD (completing a thesis and publication), whereas the supervisors concentrated on the process of learning and scientific development. Conclusions: Evidence in the study suggested product/process differences in the student and supervisor conceptualisation of the PhD. This paper offers development towards a research-led pedagogy of supervision that places the process 
and product of a PhD at the centre of the supervisory relationship. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Black students and mathematics achievement: A mixed-method analysis of in-school and out-of-school factors shaping student success
AN  - 926271005; 2012-99011-013
AB  - Achievement gap language has become associated with the observed disparities on a number of educational measures between the academic performances of Black and White students. This theoretical lens is problematic because it sends an unintended message that Black students are not worthy of study in their own right. Using a mixed-methodological approach, this study aimed to respond to the call of math educator Gutierrez (2008) who urges education researchers to "move away from gap gazing and toward more contextualized and intervention studies" (p. 362). Chapter 2 offers a socio-historical perspective to illuminate the evidence of Blacks' limited access both to mathematics as a discipline of study and a career path. A gap in the literature on the history of math education of Blacks exists, thus Tolley's (2003) seminal study on the factors that influenced the study of math and science for European girls (1840s to 1950s) is used to generate hypotheses about what factors might contribute or inhibit math participation and achievement of Blacks. Chapter 3 identifies four contemporary factors and closes with a concept map combining all eight factors. Along with the historical analysis, 69 student surveys and 12 in-depth interviews provided robust data that revealed an additional four factors—personality style, teacher- student relationships, motivation, and human agency. This study defined success broadly to include not only test scores, but persistence, course-taking patterns, fulfilling college admission requirements, and positive math identities. A mathematical model is put forth as a different way to think about math achievement for Black students schooled in the U.S. The model helps us to understand that Black students' math achievement can be viewed as a summation of a group of factors that are a part of what I call a micro and macro socio- historical background.

T1  - Toward conceptual development of a theory of clinical instructor identity using the experiences of medical laboratory science practitioners
AN  - 1267037057; 2012-99210-495
AB  - This study investigated medical laboratory science clinical instructors' beliefs about teaching and how they viewed themselves as teachers. The first phase of the study included an integrative literature review, which suggests that the development of teacher identity in school-based educators, and to a lesser extent higher education faculty, is dependent on four dimensions: personal factors, training factors, contextual factors, and reflective practice. Using a theory-building research technique, conceptual development of a theory of teacher identity was initiated based on these findings and the proposed theory is depicted in a concept map. The second phase of this study began qualitative inquiry into the ways that these participants describe their professional identity and talk about their teaching. Interviews were conducted with medical laboratory science clinical instructors in order to gain an understanding of their perceptions of themselves as teachers. The data collected in this study indicate that this group of clinical instructors saw themselves as educators in a variety of ways. They saw themselves as teachers who were responsible for providing students with the technical skills needed to become competent medical laboratory science practitioners and the theoretical foundation necessary to pass the national certification exam. The study participants also saw themselves as mentors who were responsible for passing along professional knowledge to the next generation of laboratory practitioners. During data analysis three themes emerged that represent aspects of teacher identity in clinical instructors (clinical instructor identity): belief in one's teaching ability (
Nature vs. Nurture: We Have the Ability to Teach), desire to expand one's professional responsibilities ( 
Professional Identity: Doing Something Extra), and reflection on one's teaching (
Thinking about Teaching Made Me a Better Teacher). These themes and their supporting elements are generally consistent with the dimensions of teacher identity identified in the literature review and the seminal identity theories of Erikson (1956), Marcia (1966), and Gee (2001). The findings from this study may provide a foundation for future research designed to measure teacher identity in clinical instructors. Implications for practice are also included.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping and questioning on students' organization and retention of science knowledge while using interactive informational read-alouds
AN  - 1221852194; 2012-99170-041
AB  - According to recent assessment data, there is an urgent need to improve students’ knowledge of science. It has been suggested that the infusion of reading activities including concept mapping, questioning and interactive read-alouds can help students in learning science concepts. Little or no research has combined these methods to examine its effect on learning. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare concept mapping and questioning on students’ organization and retention of science knowledge when used with interactive informational read-alouds of science trade books. This study included 58 third grade students from four homogenous classes who were assigned to either a concept mapping group (experimental group) or a questioning with writing group (comparison group). With the same teacher, the school science specialist, the students completed an eight day unit regarding “soil formation” comprised of read-alouds, discussions and reading comprehension activities. (There were no hands-on, laboratory experiments.) Students were assessed on different types of knowledge. Data were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA design to determine both within-factors (repeated measure), to show growth, and between-factors, to determine the difference between the two groups. The concept mapping group (experimental group) performed significantly higher than the questioning with writing group (comparison) on (a) relational vocabulary assessment (measuring relational knowledge); (b) multiple-choice assessment (measuring students’ ability to identify key ideas); and (c) writing assessment (measuring students’ relational thinking, students’ ability to retain and recall key information and students’ ability to use domain knowledge). The concept mapping group maintained these gains in a delayed assessment. The groups did not differ on individual word knowledge as measured by a matching assessment. Recommendations are provided for teachers and researchers including using concept mapping in teaching science concepts to elementary students in conjunction with science text reading, as well as incorporating technology with computer-generated concept maps using 
Inspiration software. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A concept-map integrated dynamic assessment system for improving ecology observation competences in mobile learning activities
AN  - 1114702947; 2012-24335-002
AB  - Observation competence plays a fundamental role in outdoor scientific investigation. The computerized concept mapping technique as a Mindtool has shown the potential for enhancing meaningful learning in science education. The purposes of the present study are to develop a concept map integrated mobile learning design for ecology observation and to examine the implementation effect for elementary school children. Also, the difference in growth slopes between gifted and average students is investigated. Eighteen gifted students and thirty average students were included in this study. A computerized dynamic assessment system which combines a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) and a concept map integrated ecology observation learning design were implemented. The results of the hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis reveal that the overall growth slope is significant (μ = 0.27, p < .01). The effect size is 0.53. The growth slope of the gifted students is a little higher than that of the average students. However, the slope difference between ability groups is not significant. The results suggest that a well designed concept map integrated learning system demonstrates very promising potential for enhancing both the gifted and average students’ mobile observation competence. The system developed in this study could be a useful resource for elementary school outdoor learning design. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Sequential pattern analysis: Method and application in exploring how students develop concept maps
AN  - 1114697864; 2012-24335-012
AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that represents knowledge in graphs. It has been widely adopted in science education and cognitive psychology to aid learning and assessment. To realize the sequential manner in which students develop concept maps, most research relies upon human-dependent, qualitative approaches. This article proposes a method for sequential pattern analysis, inspired by sequential pattern mining algorithms generally applied to commercial forecast and decision supports. The method can be programmed for automatic execution and thus reasonably fast, yielding reproducible results. To validate the proposed method, 187 college students were recruited to create respective concept maps on a computerized concept mapping system. While the concept mapping data was analyzed by the sequential pattern analysis method, it was found that the mapping sequences used by students that created superior concept maps were similar and had a pattern in which propositions were formed in a temporal order from more inclusive to less inclusive. Conversely, no similarity was found in the concept mapping sequences by those who created inferior concept maps. The findings support theoretical expectations about concept mapping and are consistent with qualitative evidence based on student self-reports.

T1  - An interactive concept map approach to supporting mobile learning activities for natural science courses
AN  - 901194505; 2011-21450-009
AB  - Mobile and wireless communication technologies not only enable anytime and anywhere learning, but also provide the opportunity to develop learning environments that combine real-world and digital-world resources. Nevertheless, researchers have indicated that, without effective tools for helping students organize their observations in the field, the mobile learning performance could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes an interactive concept map-oriented approach for supporting mobile learning activities. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhances learning attitudes, but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

T1  - A concept map approach to developing collaborative Mindtools for context‐aware ubiquitous learning
AN  - 910380676; 2011-18319-007
AB  - Recent advances in mobile and wireless communication technologies have enabled various new learning approaches which situate students in environments that combine real-world and digital-world learning resources; moreover, students are allowed to share knowledge or experiences with others during the learning process. Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students.

T1  - Identification of the design variables of eLearning tools
AN  - 896409067; 2011-11333-010
AB  - The widespread availability of digital learning resources in a variety of media formats has promoted the proliferation of eLearning systems as an integral part of teaching across all sectors of education. However, these systems are rarely planned in advance taking into account its final usefulness. At most, they are validated through learner experience using the final implemented system. In this paper, a scientific technique called concept mapping is proposed to identify the external variables that should be kept in mind while designing an eLearning tool. As a result, improvements can be programmed to increase its utility in the teaching activities prior to its use. The method has been tested in the development of a eLearning system used for advanced microprocessor teaching. Results are shown through two-dimensional maps, in which variables can be seen as clusters or groups of ideas. These variables can be used as a guide for developing an eLearning tool. The reliability of the results is also analyzed to check the correct application of the proposed technique. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Security education in Singapore: A study of knowledge structures in electronic security technology
AN  - 876193257; 2011-07524-003
AB  - The development of understanding in the discipline of security science is just beginning. As the academic research on defining the domain of security science continues, so does the development of learning security-related concepts in the understanding of the knowledge structure. This study has considered a methodology for the portrayal of knowledge structures in the domain of electronic security and its associated concepts. It seeks to examine the understanding of novice learners’ perceptions of electronic security concepts through the knowledge structure approach. The multi-dimensional scaling technique has been applied to dissimilarity measures on a selection of concepts from the domain of electronic security. These concepts were considered as key ideas in the learning of electronic security. The 
formal knowledge structure for electronic security concepts was mapped for an expert group that was most familiar with the understanding of this domain of security science. In addition, two student groups from the Singapore Institute of Technical Education participated in the study, and produced concept maps for the same electronic security concepts. The structures of the novice groups when compared to the expert group lacked the definition of clusters of related concepts, and were interpreted as lacking the understanding of experts in this knowledge domain.

T1  - Retrieval practice produces more learning than elaborate studying with concept mapping
AN  - 858289843; 2011-04504-004
AB  - Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, whereas activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Learning from animated concept maps with concurrent audio narration
AN  - 910379684; 2011-26762-005
AB  - An animated concept map is a presentation of a network diagram in which nodes and links are sequentially added or modified. An experiment compared learning from animated concept maps and text by randomly assigning 133 undergraduates to study 1 of 4 narrated animations presenting semantically equivalent information accompanied by identical audio narration. Two of the animations presented text; one with concurrent audio and another with delayed audio. Two of the animations presented concept maps; one in black and white and the other with nodes colored to represent semantic relatedness. The concept map groups outperformed the text groups on free recall (p < .05). The black-and-white concept map group outperformed the text groups on a multiple-choice knowledge test (p < .05). No advantages were statistically detected for color enhancements of the animated map. The results indicate that verbal information can be effectively communicated by learner-paced animated concept maps accompanied by audio narrations.

T1  - Concept mapping and the science achievement of third grade students
AN  - 921295031; 2011-99230-293
AB  - Instructional strategies in science that fail to identify students’ initial understanding of scientific concepts may leave students’ flawed ideas unchanged, thus affecting their ability to synthesize, differentiate, and connect to new information in science. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between concept mapping and science achievement. Cognitive learning theories formed the theoretical framework for the study. The research questions addressed in this study examined whether a significant difference exists between the concept mapping (treatment) and the traditional (control) groups on posttest scores and on test scores across time and group. A one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine if there was a significant difference on posttest scores from 70 third grade students after controlling for pretest scores. Results of the ANCOVA analysis revealed the homogeneity of regression slopes assumption was not met. A two way repeated measures mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if there were differences on participants’ test scores by time and group. A statistically significant effect was found within subjects’ main effect across time and between subjects main effect by group. These findings provide a direction for facilitating social change by recognizing conceptual structures that enable students to distinguish the interrelatedness between new and existing knowledge for learning, suggesting implications for effecting achievement in school and in the workplace. This research is significant to educators, administrators, and parents in providing an understanding of concept mapping and the effect on cognitive learning.

T1  - The multiple-choice concept map (MCCM): An interactive computer-based assessment method
AN  - 915046739; 2011-99210-529
AB  - This research attempted to bridge the gap between cognitive psychology and educational measurement (Mislevy, 2008; Leighton & Gierl, 2007; Nichols, 1994; Messick, 1989; Snow & Lohman, 1989) by using cognitive theories from working memory (Baddeley, 1986; Miyake & Shah, 1999; Grimley & Banner, 2008), multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001), and cognitive load (Chandler and Sweller, 1991, 1992; Cerpa, Chandler, & Sweller, 1996) to identify potential design weaknesses of traditional select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map assessment and then to guide the design of the new and improved multiple-choice concept map (MCCM) assessment method. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of (1) the type of the list of concepts or relations and (2) the spatial placement of the selection list on the examinee’s overall mental effort. Using a 2x2 Factorial MANCOVA, with prior knowledge as the covariate, the participants were compared on the length of time to complete the assessment and on examinee’s rating of personal mental effort exerted during the assessment. A Simple Planned Comparison was conducted to evaluate estimated mean differences between the primary group of interest (MCCM-integrated Group 4) and each of the other three groups. Of additional interest were differences among the four different groups on the examinees’ attitudes and impressions toward their respective assessment method; these data provided more insight into the quality of design for each treatment group. The type of List/Map had a significant main effect on the overall mental effort/strain or the linear combination of time on task and mental effort rating scores. More specifically, however, the test of between-subjects effects indicated that the type of list/map had a statistically significant effect on the time to complete the assessment, but not on the examinees’ mental effort ratings. In other words, participants who received the MCCM assessments (which used the MCL) completed the assessment task significantly faster but did not rate higher or lower on personal mental effort than the participants who received the traditional SAFI concept map assessments. The spatial placement of the selection list (integrated and non-integrated) did not have a statistically significant main effect on the linear combination of time on task and mental effort rating scores. The test of between-subjects effects indicated that the spatial placement of the selection list (integrated versus non-integrated) did not have a statistically significant effect on the time to complete the assessment or on the examinees’ exerted mental effort. In other words, participants who received who received the integrated lists did not complete the assessment task faster and did not rate themselves lower on personal mental effort than the participants who received non-integrated selection list. The estimated mean time on task of the primary group of interest (MCCM-integrated Group 4) was significantly shorter than that of both SAFI groups (integrated and non-integrated), but was not significantly shorter when compared to the time on task of the MCCM-non-integrated Group 3. There were no significant differences on mental effort ratings between MCCM-integrated Group 4 and either of the other three groups. The participant responses to the Attitudes and Impressions Questionnaire indicated a general preference for the MCCM over the more traditional SAFI map and, in some cases, a slight preference of MCCM-integrated over MCCM-non-integrated. The multiple-choice concept map (MCCM) is a new interactive computer-based assessment method that bridges well-documented research findings from cognitive science and psychometrics and has the potential to be an external knowledge representation with much-desired characteristics of being valid, efficient, and explicit.

T1  - A longitudinal examination of middle school science learners' use of scaffolding in and around a dynamic modeling tool
AN  - 906335016; 2011-99170-186
AB  - Scaffolding is a term rooted in multiple research communities over decades of development. Customized, contingent support can be provided to learners to enable performances beyond what they can do alone. This dissertation seeks to examine how effectively scaffolds designed to promote articulation (written expressions of learner understanding) actually work, and if this effectiveness and/or the quality of the resulting models changes over time. It longitudinally examines the use of scaffolds designed into a dynamic modeling tool, as it is used by middle school science learners to create, test, and revise models of complex science phenomena like stream ecosystems. This dissertation also reviews the origins of the scaffolding construct, and summarizes conceptions of scaffolding from various lines of research. Scaffolding can be provided by both human and non-human agents, such as computers, which require specialized interface design to ensure maximum effectiveness. In the study, learners created models in four curriculum units over the seventh and eighth grade school years. Additionally, this dissertation examines the nature of the discussion learners have while using these scaffolds and the frequency and types of interpersonal scaffolds employed during the creation of models. Model quality is also examined using a rubric developed through review of prior research on assessing models and concept maps. Learner pairs' model creation sessions on a computer are captured with screen video and learner audio, and then distilled to transcripts for subsequent coding and analysis, supported by qualitative analysis software. Articulation scaffolds were found to succeed in promoting articulations and the quality of those articulations improved over time. Learner dialog associated with these written articulations is of reasonable quality but did not improve over time. Quality of model artifacts did improve over time. The overall use of scaffolding by each learner pair was contrasted with that pairs model quality, but no relationship was found. Software design and classroom implementation implications of these findings are discussed. The frequency of interpersonal scaffolding provided by teachers highlights the need to consider scaffolding holistically and synergistically, with design decisions for software tools made in light of careful analysis as to what human and non-human agents can and should each provide.

T1  - Nature or nurture? A characterization of the knowledge and practices of in- and out-of-field beginning secondary physics teachers
AN  - 902549619; 2011-99150-057
AB  - Previous studies have shown that adequate content knowledge is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for affective teaching. While legislation requests teachers to be "highly qualified" in a subject area, such as physics, many teachers are frequently asked to teach in an area when they are not certified through a teaching license to do so. This study uses mixed methods to examine the knowledge of beginning physics teachers. Through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and concept maps, the pedagogical content knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and practices of three groups of beginning secondary physics teachers were explored. Data were analyzed qualitatively using cases and quantitatively using descriptive statistics and t-tests, the results of which were combined during the interpretation phase of the research process. The study indicated that, over the first two years of teaching, the in-field group of teachers showed stronger physics content knowledge, a consideration for student difficulties with physics topics, and a positive shift in pedagogical content knowledge impacted by working with students, as compared to the rest of the teachers in the study. This research has implications in the development of secondary physics teachers and in the field of physics education research. Specifically, this research has implications in the physics content support for beginning secondary science teachers, the novice/expert research in physics education research, and the pedagogical preparation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty in physics.

T1  - Concept mapping: An intervention conducted to improve clinical skills for radiologic technology students
AN  - 902549001; 2011-99150-092
AB  - Radiologic technology programs prepare students whose goal it is to be an X-ray technologist. X-ray technologists perform exams such as routine X-rays, computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance, and mammography. The student technologist learns body part positioning, anatomy and physiology, radio-physics, and radiation protection. In addition to radiation protection, patient care and education is the most important subject the X-ray tech studies. Performing these exams aids doctors in patient diagnosis and treatment. Radiologic technologists are important members of the health care community and require educational programs to maintain the highest possible teaching and learning standards. All programs must be regionally or programmatically accredited. There are many different types of programs; however, most components are similar. There are didactic, laboratory, and clinical components. Students attend class, practice in a lab or X-ray room, and perform patient exams in a radiology department. At the conclusion of the X-ray program, students sit for a national registry governed by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists in order to work as an X-ray tech. Due to accreditation standards, all X-ray programs must meet certain goals and objectives. To take the registry and pass, students must achieve a score of 75%. Radiology instructors are always looking for teaching techniques that will allow the program to improve the registry scores. Four instructors and 48 students were invited to participate in a research study incorporating concept mapping in the laboratory portion of an X-ray program. The experimental design divided the group of students into an experimental group and a control group. The variable was the students' GPAs. The study spanned 10 weeks and followed the previously established curriculum. The experimental group received instruction on how to construct concept maps and received class time to perform this assignment. The purpose of introducing concept mapping into the classroom was to improve critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that suggest meaningful learning has occurred. The conceptual framework for this study was an expansion of Ausubel's learning theory (
The Psychology of Meaningful Verbal Learning, 1963) by Novak and Gowin (
Learning How to Learn, 2008). At the study's conclusion, the students' GPAs showed no significant improvements; however, several unexpected findings emerged. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The development and use of a concept mapping assessment tool with young children on family visits to a live butterfly exhibit
AN  - 897334274; 2011-99130-387
AB  - Although young children are major audiences of science museums, limited evidence exists documenting changes in children's knowledge in these settings due in part to the limited number of valid and reliable assessment tools available for use with this population. The purposes of this study were to develop and validate a concept mapping assessment tool and to use this tool to document the butterfly-related knowledge of young children on unguided family visits to a live butterfly exhibit at a natural history museum. In this study, forty-two children visited the live butterfly exhibit with their families on unguided tours and completed pre- and post-visit concept mapping tasks. During pre- and post-visit mapping sessions, children created and revised concept maps about butterflies using a set of eight butterfly-related concept pictures and provided verbal explanations for each picture pair in their concept maps. Three raters used three different scoring systems designed for use in this study to evaluate the scientific accuracy of the children's pre- and post-visit maps, including the picture pairs and verbal explanations. Quantitative analyses of the scores indicate that the raters used the three scoring systems with a moderate to high level of consistency. The results also indicate that children significantly increased their butterfly-related knowledge in the live butterfly exhibit regardless of recent prior experience with the exhibit. Qualitative analyses of children's verbal explanations indicate that children possessed butterfly-related knowledge related to: the needs of butterflies, the life cycle of butterflies, the ecology of butterflies and other insects, the diversity and classification of butterflies and other insects, the threats to and conservation of butterflies, and the social and maternal behavior of butterflies. Although children with different levels of exhibit experience showed similarly high levels of prior and subsequent knowledge, the types of understandings they communicated in their verbal explanations differed somewhat. Surprisingly, children without recent prior exhibit experience showed greater understanding in more areas of butterfly-related knowledge than children with recent prior exhibit experience. The results of this study have implications for the field of science education in general and the field of informal science education in particular.

T1  - Cooperative learning: Attitudes, perceptions, and achievement in a traditional, online, and hybrid instructional setting
AN  - 861793185; 2011-99030-074
AB  - Cooperative learning has been sufficiently studied to be accepted as an effective method of education. Student reception of cooperative learning, and therefore the degree of its success in a given situation, will depend on the mode of delivery. New technology for delivering courses totally online challenges many aspects of traditional education, and is particularly difficult for cooperative learning that relies heavily on intense face-to-face communication among students. This study was conducted to compare cooperative learning in a traditional setting to that in hybrid and online settings. A model for delivering a cooperative learning experience has been developed utilizing concept maps within an upper division college course, History of Biology, as well as a hybrid version of the same course with the cooperative learning module run in a traditional class while the rest of the course remained online. A variation of this model is also being used to compare traditional and hybrid formats of introductory biology courses. The model for cooperative learning worked well for the majority of students. Based on attitudinal results, cooperative learning is equally successful regardless of the amount of face-to-face interaction. Students in the online version of this course were pleased with their cooperative learning experience despite the absence of this interaction. Many stated that it helped them gain a deeper understanding of the material. It also provided students with an environment conducive to peer tutoring and social interaction which is often missing from many online experiences. In each course, an increase in achievement was also indicated. This increase was significant for the hybrid and traditional setting. This model, however, was very challenging for the instructor. The hybrid version of the course was much more user-friendly than its fully online counterpart.

T1  - The effect of metaconceptual teaching activities on pre-service biology teachers' conceptual understanding about seed plants
AN  - 1122597626; 2012-11258-023
AB  - The term metaconceptual refers to metacognitive knowledge and processes that are acting on and related to one’s conceptual system. In this study, metaconceptual teaching activities were implemented to facilitate preservice teachers’ engagement in metaconceptual processes. It was the purpose of this research to investigate the changes in pre-service teachers’ alternative ideas regarding flowering plants after being exposed to metaconceptual teaching activities. The participants consisted of 32 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in a college level second-year laboratory class about flowering plants. A 13 item open-ended question set was administered a week before and a week after the instructional interventions. In order to facilitate students’ engagement in metaconceptual processes, they were exposed to several instructional activities including poster drawing, journal writing, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. Alternative conceptions that pre-service teachers had prior to and following the instructional interventions were identified and the ones that changed, did not change and developed after the instruction were examined. The results of this study show that metaconceptual teaching activities were effective at changing pre-service teachers’ alternative conceptions regarding flowering plants.

T1  - The effects of three concept mapping strategies on seventh-grade students' science achievement at an urban middle school
AN  - 1018477138; 2012-99070-095
AB  - There is great concern over students' poor science achievement in the United States. Due to the lack of science achievement, students are not pursing science related careers resulting in an increase in outsourcing to other countries. Learning strategies such as concept mapping may ameliorate this situation by providing students with tools that encourage meaningful learning. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to measure the effects of three concept mapping learning strategies (concept identifying, proposition identifying, student generated) on urban middle school students' understanding of the circulatory system. Three intact classes of seventh-grade students were assigned to one of the three concept mapping strategies. The students were given a pretest on the circulatory system then learned and used their respective concept mapping strategies while learning about the circulatory system. At the conclusion of the study, students' science achievement was measured by performance on an achievement test and rubric scores of their respective concept identifying, proposition identifying, and student generated concept maps. The results of the study suggest that all three of the concept mapping strategies are effective in increasing students' science achievement. Additionally, the moderate significant correlations between the posttest and concept map scores of the current study established that concept maps are a useful measure of student knowledge. Lastly, the results of the current study also suggest that the concept identifying mapping strategy may be a useful scaffold in instructing students how to develop student generated concept maps.

T1  - Preparing students for future learning with teachable agents
AN  - 852907846; 2010-23567-002
AB  - One valuable goal of instructional technologies in K-12 education is to prepare students for future learning. Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves this goal. TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn. Students teach their agent by creating concept maps. Artificial intelligence enables TA to use the concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback. Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA exhibited "added-value" learning that did not adversely affect the "basic-value" they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time. Moreover, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer using the software. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Cognitive ability and the instructional efficacy of collaborative concept mapping
AN  - 622193104; 2010-09569-001
AB  - Data were gathered from 248 secondary students (14 years old, 56% female) who learned about the circulatory system in 77 self-selected collaborative groups. The learning outcomes of biology students who summarised by collaborative concept mapping were compared with those of students who summarised by collaborative writing. Learning groups randomly assigned to construct concept maps instead of conventional summaries generated more relations in the summary task and their members obtained higher individual scores on a post-test. The concept mapping strategy was found to be advantageous only for students whose cognitive ability was below the median for the sample and who were placed in groups with other students having low cognitive ability.

T1  - Non-traditional learners in higher education: Comparison of a traditional MCQ examination with concept mapping to assess learning in a dental radiological science course
AN  - 787003378; 2010-18088-008
AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for non-traditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed.

T1  - Mining concept maps from news stories for measuring civic scientific literacy in media
AN  - 622180592; 2010-06388-013
AB  - Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLiM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901,446 in total) for SLiM instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion.

T1  - Urban 5th graders conceptions during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds
AN  - 872590145; 2010-08509-001
AB  - This study aimed to determine how 33 urban 5th grade students' science conceptions changed during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds. Research on watershed and place-based education was used as a framework to guide the teaching of the unit as well as the research study. A teacher-researcher designed the curriculum, taught the unit and conducted the research using qualitative data sources such as concept maps, science notebooks and interviews. Most students came to understand that their watershed was part of an urban environment where water drains from the surrounding land into a body of water. Thus, they began to understand how urban land use affects water quality. This study provides evidence for the use of place-based learning in developing students' knowledge of the 
National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) and watersheds. Implications of this study include the use of place-based learning in urban settings and the experiences needed for students to conceptualize watersheds. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Enhanced learning of biotechnology students by an inquiry-based cellulase laboratory
AN  - 759137122; 2010-18727-004
AB  - This study explored the effectiveness of an inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit in promoting inquiry in undergraduate students in biotechnology. The following tools were used to assess the students’ achievements and attitude: conceptual understanding test, concept mapping, students’ documents, CLES questionnaire, students’ self reflection, and interviews. Judging from their conceptual understanding test results and concept mapping, students gained significantly more content knowledge on enzyme-substrate interaction and its application. In addition, students’ reports on their projects revealed that they have developed their critical thinking, scientific process skills and abilities to apply knowledge on enzyme cellulase to industrial application. The students reacted positively to this teaching strategy as demonstrated by results from questionnaire responses, students’ self reflection and interviews. The success of this inquiry-based laboratory unit might be due to both the context which was of interest to students, and the instruction method which ranged from a guided to a more open inquiry. Most importantly, the teacher in this study had mastery of both content and pedagogical techniques. This inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit provided significant benefits for teaching and learning science for biotechnology students. It promoted acquisition of content knowledge and skills such as asking good questions, predicting, problem solving, drawing conclusion, and communication. This inquiry-based laboratory unit may serve as a guideline or framework for implementing a dynamic instruction with a range of inquiry level for the undergraduates.

T1  - Enriching traditional biology lectures—Digital concept maps and their influence on achievement and motivation
AN  - 1136145684; 2012-24282-004
AB  - Higher education deals with complex knowledge and university teaching should focus on conceptual understanding. Adequate knowledge structures are essential and active knowledge construction should be supported for meaningful learning. But traditional lectures mostly are structured by slides which may misleadingly cause linear representations of knowledge. In this study, a framework for digital concept maps was developed to complement lectures in human biology. The course was aimed at student science teachers at the undergraduate level. The work is based on theoretical research on computer-supported learning, on knowledge structures perspectives within learning environments as well as on self-determination theory. Each session was supplemented by a digital, multimedia-enriched concept map. After each single lecture, students had free access to the concept maps to reinforce the latest topics. The objective of the study was to examine if the use of complementary concept maps (i) influences achievement and (ii) if motivational variables influence the use of the concept maps. In both cases, influences of computer-user self-efficacy were expected (iii). The students’ (N = 171) concept map use was logged, achievement was tested and motivational variables were surveyed (e.g. interest/ enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/importance, value/usefulness). The logfile-data allowed distinguishing learners according to their concept map use. Results reveal the benefit of additional concept maps for achievement, positive motivational aspects and computer-user self-efficacy as mediating factors showed some influence. The emphasize of further research should be on students’ active engagement in structuring their individual learning by constructing concept maps themselves, especially in science education courses.

T1  - Implementation of concept mapping to novices: Reasons for errors, a matter of technique or content?
AN  - 622008241; 2009-23594-005
AB  - Concept mapping is discussed as a means to promote meaningful learning and in particular progress in reading comprehension skills. Its increasing implementation necessitates the acquisition of adequate knowledge about frequent errors in order to make available an effective introduction to the new learning method. To analyse causes of errors, 283 A-level sixth graders produced concept maps about two differently complex subject matter lessons, we implemented in a pre-lesson. We defined six types of errors and analysed the distribution and contingency tables in both subject matters. Students in general produced more complex concept maps in the context of the easier subject matter (A) than that of the difficult content (B). Whereas in the former errors simply indicated knowledge gaps, in the latter they often reflected technical misconceptions. The occurrence of a content-dependent technical error in (B) pointed to a cognitive overload, since the more difficult content is hypothesised to cause higher intrinsic load. From this following, concept mapping could provoke an instructional enrichment by additionally revealing specific knowledge gaps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A meta-analytical review of Novak's concept mapping
AN  - 622203270; 2010-99051-113
AB  - The current systematic review furthers the field of Novak's concept mapping founded on Ausubel meaningful learning theory. Based upon 46 effects from 38 studies, the results indicate that Novak's concept maps are effective learning tools for enhancing and promoting achievement among students. Within the learning domains of Science, English/English as a Second Language, Education, and Electives, concept mapping improves achievement. However, within the learning domain of Math, concept mapping groups did not demonstrate improvement of achievement. Both computer-generated and non-computer generated maps are effective means for creating maps, though non-computer-generated maps were slightly more effective. Suggestions for future research by learning domain and by means of map generation are included. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using concept maps to explore preservice teachers' perceptions of science content knowledge, teaching practices, and reflective processes
AN  - 622195229; 2010-99030-369
AB  - This qualitative study examined seven preservice teachers' perceptions of their science content knowledge, teaching practices, and reflective processes through the use of the metacognitive strategy of concept maps. Included in the paper is a review of literature in the areas of preservice teachers' perceptions of teaching, concept development, concept mapping, science content understanding, and reflective process as a part of metacognition. The key questions addressed include the use of concept maps to indicate organization and understanding of science content, mapping strategies to indicate perceptions of teaching practice, and the influence of concept maps on reflective process. There is also a comparison of preservice teachers' perceptions of concept map usage with the purposes and practices of maps as described by experienced teachers. Data were collected primarily through interviews, observations, a pre and post concept mapping activity, and an analysis of those concept maps using a rubric developed for this study. Findings showed that concept map usage clarified students' understanding of the organization and relationships within content area and that the process of creating the concept maps increased participants' understanding of the selected content. The participants felt that the visual element of concept mapping was an important factor in improving content understanding. These participants saw benefit in using concept maps as planning tools and as instructional tools. They did not recognize the use of concept maps as assessment tools. When the participants were able to find personal relevance in and through their concept maps they were better able to be reflective about the process. The experienced teachers discussed student understanding and skill development as the primary purpose of concept map usage, while they were able to use concept maps to accomplish multiple purposes in practice.

T1  - The game of science: A grounded theory of the Café Scientifique experience
AN  - 622191222; 2010-99030-074
AB  - Science Cafés are independent groups organized throughout the world for discussion of scientific topics. Little is known about the nature of this informal learning environment. A grounded-theory study was conducted to determine what attendees perceived as the essential qualities of the Café Scientifique experience in one science Café in the Western United States. Interviews with 12 attendees were transcribed and analyzed using ATLAS-ti. Concept maps and a grounded theory describing the essential characteristics were created. Member checking was used during theory generation. Findings are described in the context of a game metaphor, whereby scientific discussion at the Café is viewed as an intellectual game. The grounded theory describes the game of science being played at Café Scientifique involving attendees as players, social norms as rules for the game, an expert as the steward of truth, topics as the content for game play, interaction as playing of the game, and intellectual stimulation as the prize for playing. During the game, ideas were identified through a short presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. During this exchange, attendees heard about, analyzed, synthesized, and applied new information. As a result of the game play, players won a prize—intellectual stimulation. The Café Scientifique phenomenon provides insight into informal adult education. This study suggests the need for additional study of intellectual play in adult education, the role of curiosity and desire to explore new ways of thinking, and the developmental drive in adults to seek intellectual stimulation. The essential characteristics of Café Scientifique may be transferable to other informal adult-education settings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Usage experience and student feedback driven extension of functionality of concept map based intelligent knowledge assessment system
AN  - 622107481; 2010-00998-002
AB  - Nowadays concept maps as a pedagogical tool have stable positions in education because they are used for teaching, learning and knowledge assessment. The paper gives the basic conceptions of concept maps and their usage for knowledge assessment. The concept map based multiagent adaptive intelligent knowledge assessment system (IKAS) is described from the systems and interior structure's viewpoint. The kernel of the IKAS is the intelligent knowledge assessment agent consisting of the agent-expert, the communication agent, the knowledge evaluation agent and the interaction registering agent. The knowledge assessment agent using the comparison algorithm based on graph patterns compares a teacher's and a learner's concept maps and assigns score for submitted solution. Five years experience of the IKAS practical use along with student feedback gathered in questionnaires is the driving force for extension of the functionality of the system. The paper presents student opinion about concept maps as knowledge assessment tool confirming that concept maps help systematization of knowledge and construction of its structure, and promote logical thinking. Evaluation results of four prototypes of the system used for knowledge assessment in different study courses are described. Evolution of the IKAS is reflected and its characteristics are summarized.

T1  - Concept map structure, gender and teaching methods: An investigation of students' science learning
AN  - 754047878; 2010-11585-003
AB  - Background: This study deals with the application of concept mapping to the teaching and learning of a science topic with secondary school students in Germany. Purpose: The main research questions were: (1) Do different teaching approaches affect concept map structure or students’ learning success? (2) Is the structure of concept maps influenced by gender? (3) Is the concept map structure a reliable indicator of students’ learning success? Sample: One hundred and forty-nine high-achieving 5th-grade students from four German secondary schools participated in the study. The average age of participants was 10½ years. Gender distribution was balanced. Students produced concept maps working in small, single-sex groups. Design and methods: There were two teaching approaches used: one based upon teacher-centred instruction and one consisting of student-centred learning. Both were followed by a concept-mapping phase. Student groups experienced either one or the other teaching approach. Concept map structures were analysed using of the method of Kinchin, Hay and Adams. We defined three different possible types of concept map structure: spokes, chains and nets. Furthermore, for assessing a student’s short- and longer-term learning success, we constructed a multiple-choice knowledge test applied in a pre-, post-, retention-test design. Parametric tests, such as MANOVA, one-way ANOVA and 
t-tests were used to identify any differences in gender, teaching approach, number of nets per concept map and their interactions. Results: Type of teaching approach had an effect on concept map structure but not on students’ longer-term learning success. Students of the teacher-centred approach produced more net structures than those students who participated in the hands-on instruction. Subsequent analyses showed in total more net structures for female groups. The interaction of gender and number of nets per concept map showed a significant effect on students’ longer-term learning success. Conclusion: The study suggests that Kinchin’s classification scheme for assessing concept map quality may be a good indicator of students’ learning success when applied in combination with a knowledge test.

T1  - Preservice science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge on cell topics
AN  - 786993510; 2009-25213-011
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. The study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkale University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators.

T1  - Using concept maps to describe the evolution in obese patients’ knowledge and expectations following bariatric surgery
AN  - 1288997665; 2012-21674-005
AB  - Objectives: This study describes how the obese patient’s initial mental states evolved two years after surgery and their perception of therapeutic education. Methods: Twenty-four patients reviewed during telephone interviews the concept map they had fulfilled before surgery. Patients’ comments were analysed on the basis of their trend to confirm or refute their initial representations. Results: Twenty-three patients confirm most of their initial representations. Eight over twenty negative initial representations, often related to diet field, became positive; 21% positive initial mental states became negative in different fields. Most of the added comments had negative tendency (17 over 23) and 6 were related to the patient’s difficulties to cope with diet. Psychological and health consequences constitute the most important issues for 1/3 patients. Fourteen patients consider they have been well educated before intervention, 7 patients stress the importance of meeting other operated patients before surgery. Patients’ recommendations for therapeutic education concern post operative pains, nutrition difficulties and risk of weight regain. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the quality of therapeutic education before surgery. The difficulties related to nutrition and weight regain stress the importance of long term therapeutic education promoting patients group discussion. The use of concept maps develops the patient self evaluation skill. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Learning the attachment theory with the CM-ED concept map editor
AN  - 621765942; 2009-00155-020
AB  - This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map editor) with social education students. Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure. Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use has been studied over the last few years. CM-ED is a multilingual and multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps. Until recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science university degree. This paper represents a qualitative step in the evaluation of CM-ED: from technical students to students of more theoretical fields. The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and the carried out study are presented in this paper. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The comparative effect of individually-constructed vs. Collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept maps
AN  - 621763556; 2009-00155-011
AB  - The researchers investigated the comparative effects of individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. One hundred and sixty one students completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, students were assigned to three groups: a self-selected study strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a collaborative pairs – concept mapping group. Collaboratively and individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept learning as measured on a comprehension test. However, the students who collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding.

T1  - Investigating changes in knowledge frameworks among high school students regarding the central dogma of biology
AN  - 622095658; 2009-99210-393
AB  - Few studies have been conducted of student misconceptions, knowledge frameworks and prior knowledge at the high school level, particularly in the biological sciences. Since a deeper understanding of protein structure and function may allow secondary level students to envision other basic processes of life that are commonly targeted for public debate and decision-making, this study, using an interpretive cross-case study design, was conducted to investigate student conceptions and frameworks concerning the Central Dogma of Biology. Data sources included interviews, a pre/post-objective test, concept mapping, modified storyboarding and classroom observations. Students improved their basic knowledge of scientific terminology and their ability to make connections between terms and assimilate new terms improved. However, students did not demonstrate ability to recognize the relevance of activities as they connected to the bigger picture of the Central Dogma. New conceptual connections appeared to come from exposure not only to curriculum in the biology class, but also from outside sources like television, health class, and reading. After formal instruction, most student conceptions and frameworks progressed to level of proto-scientific reasoning (as compared to non-scientific or scientific). Implications for biology curriculum, pedagogy and further research are presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Cognitive development in introductory physics: A research-based approach to curriculum reform
AN  - 622093401; 2009-99240-238
AB  - This project describes the research on a classification of physics problems in the context of introductory physics courses. This classification, called the Taxonomy of Introductory Physics Problems (TIPP), relates physics problems to the cognitive processes required to solve them. TIPP was created for designing and clarifying educational objectives, for developing assessments that can evaluate individual component processes of the problem-solving process, and for guiding curriculum design in introductory physics courses, specifically within the context of a “thinking-skills” curriculum. TIPP relies on the following resources: (1) cognitive research findings adopted by physics education research, (2) expert-novice research discoveries acknowledged by physics education research, (3) an educational psychology taxonomy for educational objectives, and (4) various collections of physics problems created by physics education researchers or developed by textbook authors. TIPP was used in the years 2006–2008 to reform the first semester of the introductory algebra-based physics course (called Phys 11) at The George Washington University. The reform sought to transform our curriculum into a “thinking-skills” curriculum that trades “breadth for depth” by focusing on fewer topics while targeting the students’ cognitive development. We employed existing research on the physics problem-solving expert-novice behavior, cognitive science and behavioral science findings, and educational psychology recommendations. Our pedagogy relies on didactic constructs such as the 
GW-ACCESS problem-solving protocol, learning progressions and concept maps that we have developed and implemented in our introductory physics course. These tools were designed based on TIPP. Their purpose is: (1) to help students build local and global coherent knowledge structures, (2) to develop more context-independent problem-solving abilities, (3) to gain confidence in problem solving, and (4) to establish connections between everyday phenomena and underlying physics concepts. We organize traditional and research-based physics problems such that students experience a gradual increase in complexity related to problem context, problem features and cognitive processes needed to solve the problem. The instructional environment that we designed allows for explicit monitoring, control and measurement of the cognitive processes exercised during the instruction period. It is easily adaptable to any kind of curriculum and can be readily adjusted throughout the semester. To assess the development of students’ problem-solving abilities, we created rubrics that measure specific aspects of the thinking involved in physics problem solving. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) was administered pre- and post-instruction to determine students’ shift in dispositions towards learning physics. The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was administered pre- and post-instruction to determine students’ level of conceptual understanding. The results feature improvements in students’ problem-solving abilities and in their attitudes towards learning physics. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Learning through student-authored interactive media: A mixed methods exploration
AN  - 622089254; 2009-99210-406
AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve student achievement in science and proficiency in information and communication technologies (ICT), which are vital 21st century workforce skills. Instead of isolating the issues, the study proposed an integrated solution that applied the constructivist approach to help students learn about a unit in biology using three software applications to create interactive, self-correcting eModules within a two-week period. Research questions focused on the effectiveness of the instructional strategy, the experience of students authoring eModules, obstacles they encountered, and the role of the teacher. Fifty-one out of the possible 55 eleventh and twelfth grade students in the two Advanced Biology classes consented to participate in the study. A comparison of pre and post-test scores showed an average 547% improvement. Students with low initial scores of 10% or less improved an average of 1229%. Ten students (20%) went from 20% or below on the pre-test to 80% or above on the post-test, and were analyzed as a subgroup called “big gainers.” Student journals and exit surveys were explored to understand the process students followed to develop eModules. The majority of student responses in the exit survey (85%) described the overall experience as a positive one. Journals showed how students were able to follow the process of creating a concept map using Inspiration software, converting the outline into a PowerPoint slide show, editing the slides and importing them into Adobe Captivate files, inserting self-correcting questions, completing their eModules, and submitting them to their teacher. Students identified obstacles they encountered to help them to problem solve and provided data for improving the instructional strategy. Addressing technology learning objectives within the context and pacing of a content area class was accomplished, but it required providing a collaborative learning environment, an appropriate task, mediating tools, and assessment. The data analysis suggests that the instructional strategy of student-authored eModules had a positive impact on learning science content and ICT proficiencies. Historically students have been consumers of interactive media or producers of presentational media. This study suggests that they will learn more when they are the authors of interactive media.

T1  - An analysis of science conceptual knowledge in journals of students with disabilities and normally achieving students
AN  - 622085555; 2009-99210-557
AB  - Science education reforms of the last two decades have focused on raising the bar for ALL students which includes students with mild to moderate disabilities. Formative assessment can be used to assess the progress of these students to inquire, understand scientific concepts, reason scientifically, make decisions, and communicate effectively in science. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of science journals as a formative assessment in a guided inquiry unit of study for students with learning disabilities. Two normally achieving students (NA) and five students with learning disabilities (SLD) participated in a study of mammals that utilized journals to record the development of student knowledge through the course of study. Students were interviewed after the lessons were complete using the same prompts required in the journals. Themes were developed from the student writings and their verbal discourse using Grounded Theory. Journals and verbal discourse were rated following the themes of Knowledge Telling (KT) and Knowledge Transformation (KTR). Concept maps were developed for the Pre and Post test lessons (written and verbal discourses) by the raters in an attempt to further explain the knowledge that the students conveyed. The results of this study suggest that SLD are able to demonstrate knowledge about mammals better through verbal discourse than written discourse. While the NA students wrote more and used more technical discourse than did their SLD peers, the conceptual understanding of the topic by the SLD was no less inclusive than their NA peers when accessed verbally. The journals demonstrated limited conceptual growth for the SLD. Further, while lexical density is important to the development of knowledge in science, this study suggests the “conceptual density” may be another important indicator to examine.

T1  - Teaching taboo topics without talking about them: An epistemic study of a new approach to HIV/AIDS prevention education in India
AN  - 622079492; 2009-99170-521
AB  - Background. Solving the problem of how to provide effective health education on diseases subject to social taboos is an immediate need. The social stigma of HIV/AIDS is particularly prominent in the developing world, where 95 percent of all HIV-infected persons live. Millions of people are risking death from HIV/AIDS while cultures and laws resist change. New approaches must be created to provide education despite whatever social, structural, cultural, and legal barriers exist. Fortunately, the emergence of new media and information and communication technologies (ICT) has provided new ways to help bypass social taboos and provide effective education in ways which were not possible in the past. This dissertation discusses these challenges and presents criteria for evaluating the efficacy of various educational campaigns aimed at promoting awareness relating to taboo topics using a specially designed HIV/AIDS curriculum—
Interactive Teaching AIDS—as an exemplar. In health interventions, knowledge is a necessary, although seldom sufficient, step to bring about changes in attitudes and behaviors. The Interactive Teaching AIDS (ITA) application was developed, tested, and optimized over a two-year period to promote HIV/AIDS education despite social and cultural challenges. It incorporates key pedagogical and communication theories and approaches in order to maximize its efficacy. To provide psychological comfort and promote coherent understanding, this ICT-based application couples the presentation of biological aspects of transmission with culturally-familiar euphemisms and metaphors to communicate ideas about prevention measures. Through a rigorous, iterative, research-based process, the 20-minute application provides detailed yet accessible culturally-appropriate explanations of all key aspects of HIV/AIDS prevention. The process included the development of multiple prototypes and over 150 iterations in total, starting with concept maps, screenplays, storyboards, and low-fidelity paper prototypes, eventually leading to interactive versions of the curriculum in multiple media, including a final version in Adobe Flash. 
Methodology. High school and college students ( 
N=386) from New Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab, were randomly selected across four institutes in India. No one refused to participate. Students at three of the four institutes were assigned to the intervention group, and students at the fourth institute were assigned to the control group. Intervention students received the ITA application. All students received a baseline pretest, followed by an immediate posttest, and finally a retention test one month later to assess outcomes. The assessments measured knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention methods as well as attitudes regarding social acceptance of those infected with the virus. 
Results. Experimental students exhibited statistically significant gains in posttest knowledge (
p<.001) and positive changes in attitudes (
p<.001), even after controlling for pretest knowledge, gender, mother's education and father's education. One month later, the experimental students retained significant amounts of prevention knowledge (
p<.001) and displayed positive changes in attitudes (
p<.05). On the 40-item knowledge assessment, the experimental group scored 8.25 points higher than the control group participants during the posttest, and 7.03 points higher during the retention test. At onset, males performed significantly better on the pretest than females ( 
p<.01), however, after interacting with the ITA application, there was no differences between the knowledge gained and retained by males or females in the posttest or retention test, closing the achievement gap. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Pedagogical and curricular thinking of professional astronomers teaching the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in introductory astronomy courses for non-science majors
AN  - 622078846; 2009-99190-089
AB  - This qualitative study explores the pedagogical and curricular thinking of five professional astronomers, faculty at a university, about teaching the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in introductory astronomy courses for non-science majors. Data sources for this study included two semi-structured interviews per participant, in which they were asked about teaching the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, as well as about the introductory course in general. In addition, participants were asked to complete four cognitive tasks; the creation of a lesson plan, a concept map on how they would like their students to think about the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram at the end of the course, a Pathfinder network rating task, and responding to stereotypical student statements regarding the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The data was analyzed using a case study approach, followed by a discussion of themes that emerged from the data. Results indicate that participants had primarily affect and process goals for the course, rather than content goals. In addition, they wanted students to view the HR diagram as a part of a flow chart, where input physics (both observed and inferred properties of stars) leads to the construction of the HR diagram, which in turn is used to make inferences about stellar evolution. Participants identified several student difficulties with the HR diagram, among which interpreting a graph was the most pertinent. In several stereotypical student statements, participants responded using the exact same analogies to explain the concepts to the students. This may be indicative of some underlying pedagogical content knowledge. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The walk of life: Stress in the lives of school superintendents in Central Illinois
AN  - 622078091; 2009-99190-131
AB  - The purpose of this study and research was to provide a descriptive and holistic study of stressors in the superintendency and find out how practicing superintendents respond to and manage stress. The research in this qualitative research study was presented in narrative form. This methodology is founded on the evidence that individuals make sense of their lives and world according to the stories that they have developed to illustrate it. The use of stories or narratives allows the reader to contemplate their own personal experiences and to learn about others within our world. Stories also mark historical events, add to the culture of the area being studied and to our understanding. The stories were based upon extensive interviews and used as case studies toward data analysis. Qualitative research tools of concept mapping, decoding, distinctions of the participants and cross member checking were done within this study. Theory triangulation of the data was used along with the narratives as case studies to interpret and analyze toward a single set of data. Major questions involved in this study of stress and the superintendency were: What were the perceived stressors of the participants in the study? How were the participants affected by stress? What were the participating superintendents doing to cope with stress. The evolution and context of this dissertation and its research were portrayed through the stories or narratives section. The stories illustrated the objectives of the research, exemplified the selection of the participating members, and engraved the responses and feelings of the participating school superintendents of small, medium and large school districts. Also, the stories depicted the perceived stressors and coping techniques used by the participants in this research study. Their life stories represent highlights and case studies that then yielded an interpretive ethnographical portrayal of the stress in the lives of the superintendency. The narratives or stories became case studies and exhibited and identified some of the main stressors they face in their jobs and lives, the effects, and their ways of coping with stress both positively and negatively. The perceived stressors, affects of stress, and what the practicing superintendents did to cope were brought out in this study. The study could be utilized to more effectively understand and cope with stress. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The relationship between adolescents' domain knowledge and creative performance on an ill-defined physics task
AN  - 622075891; 2009-99170-419
AB  - This research explored the relationship between knowledge and creativity. More specifically, the study addressed the question of how domain knowledge contributed to creative performance on an ill-defined physics problem in a sample of adolescents attending an enrichment program for gifted students. While most contemporary theories of creativity highlight the knowledge base as a key component of creativity, very little research has explicitly investigated the relationship between knowledge and creativity in the context of creative problem solving. Employing a version of Amabile's (1983) Consensual Assessment Technique, this study explored (a) to what extent domain knowledge contributed to creative performance over and above divergent thinking ability and general intellectual ability, (b) what qualities of the domain knowledge base were associated with creative performance, and (c) how domain knowledge was applied to facilitate creative problem solving. In a mixed-methods research design, the first question was addressed through hierarchical regression, while data pertaining to the second question were analyzed descriptively and the third involved the qualitative analysis of think-aloud protocols. Among the key findings were: (a) scores on a physics test did not significantly predict performance on the creative problem solving task; (b) participants with the highest creativity scores were more likely than those who scored lowest to sort a set of physics word problems into categories based on key concepts rather than surface features, to group pairs of problems in a manner that reflected a deeper understanding of physics and to construct more conceptually-organized physics concept maps; and (c) participants with the highest creativity scores tended to explain their solutions to the creative problem solving task in terms of relevant physics concepts, to reason towards a solution by generating and testing hypotheses grounded in domain knowledge, and to combine concepts and materials in unusual and effective ways. Findings are discussed in relation to research and theory related to expertise and the creative process. In particular, similarities are drawn between the characteristics and application of the domain knowledge base commonly found in experts and those that distinguished creative from less creative participants in the context of the ill-defined task in this study.

T1  - Show and tell: Learning with interactive videoconferencing in kindergarten
AN  - 622067285; 2009-99110-109
AB  - The research investigated how kindergartners make meaning using interactive videoconferencing. The study explored two research questions: (1) What types of meanings are being formed by the kindergartners during interactive videoconferences and, (2) What are the nature of young children's emerging inquiries and dialogue surrounding their use of interactive videoconferencing in their classroom? The study embodied a Vygotskian perspective as the theoretical framework in order to meet demands associated with the young participants' vulnerability, developmental appropriateness, and the students' interactive learning environment. Employing an ethnographic, participant observation methodology, the research design was informed by three criteria: (1) a pilot study, (2) Miles and Huberman's (1994a) recurring themes in qualitative data analysis, and (3) literature review results emphasizing the nuances of contemporary culture. Field observation occurred from October 2007 through February 2008 in a Southwestern Pennsylvania kindergarten classroom. Students participated in 7 videoconferences with distant peers or content experts. Data from a gingerbread and puppetry videoconference and an astronomy program were selected for further analysis based on their ability to illustrate poignant examples of how the kindergartners formed meaning during collaborations. Data analysis procedures involved the importing of dialogue from videoconferencing transcriptions, field notes, and other artifacts into the ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis software for open coding, data display, and grounded theory development. Results developed from open coding and concept maps in ATLAS.ti informed the following theory development. First, learning with interactive videoconferencing in kindergarten supports meaning making from four Vygotskian tenets: (1) the social origins of learning, (2) sign and tool use through mediated activity, (3) the importance of language, and (4) support for the zone of proximal development. Additionally, the students' meaning making involved the tenets' entwinement rather than the solitary occurrence of individual tenets. Regarding the kindergartners' emerging inquiries, during sustained interactive videoconferencing levels, children's inquiries and dialogue evidenced exploratory talk that was purposeful, reflective and self-directed. It also indicated comfort with the technology. This study is unique in its multidisciplinary application of Vygotskian learning theory to kindergartners' meaning making with videoconferencing and provides a foundation for extended use of qualitative methods to examine young children's' learning with technology.

T1  - Effects of the use of thematic organizers in conjunction with concept mapping on learning, misconceptions, and retention in middle school science class
AN  - 622065995; 2009-99130-181
AB  - This study was devised to determine effects of the use of interactive thematic organizers and concept maps in middle school science classes during a unit study on minerals. The design, a pretest-posttest control group, consisted of matched groups (three experimental groups and one comparison group). It also included a student survey assessing qualitative aspects of the investigation. The 67 6th-grade students and one science teacher who participated in the study were from an independent K-12 school. Students represented a normal, well-distributed range of abilities. Group I (control) proceeded with their usual method of studying a unit—reading aloud the text and answering workbook questions. Group II worked with interactive thematic organizers, designed to activate prior knowledge and help students make inferences about target concepts in three treatments. Group III created three interactive concept maps, which represented both understandings and misconceptions. Concept maps were reviewed and repaired as students completed each treatment. Group IV participated in both thematic organizer and concept map treatments. Statistical analyses were determined through a pretest and a delayed recall posttest essay for all four groups. Two scores were assigned—one quantitative raw score of correct explicit answers and one rubric score based on the quality of interpretive responses. Group II also received scores for thematic organizer responses. Group III received rubric scores for concept maps. Group IV received all possible scores. Paired 
t-tests reported comparisons of scores across the treatment groups. A linear regression indicated whether or not concept map misconceptions affected posttest scores. Finally, an ANCOVA reported statistical significance across the four treatment groups. Findings of data analysis indicated statistically significant improvement in posttest scores among students in the three experimental groups. Students who participated in both treatments represented the highest scores among the four groups. Results of the ANCOVA indicated there was statistically significant difference in scores among the four treatments. Recommendations were made to further investigate development of interactive thematic organizers with student-chosen hyperlinks to concepts, as well as a recommendation that researchers investigate teacher understandings of interpretive purpose and form in the creation of thematic organizers.

T1  - The effect of an STC orientation to teaching on student academic performance and motivation in secondary earth science
AN  - 622065357; 2009-99110-078
AB  - Student achievement gaps among subgroups remain a prevalent and critical issue in urban education systems. In many classes these students remain the target—and often the victims—of test-driven curriculum. Missing from their urban education is one of the most important aspects of a true education: a sense of place within that education. Science educators and educational researchers might consider the benefits of Sociotransformative Constructivism (STC) as a means of creating a more meaningful education for urban youth. This study examined the impact of an STC teaching orientation on student motivation and academic performance in secondary earth science students. The mixed methodology employed used both qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection consisted of STC activities, survey data, classroom observations, studentgenerated work and threaded discussions. Statistical analysis included independent t-tests of pre- and post-instruction concept maps. The results showed that the adaptation of an STC teaching orientation has a positive impact on student motivation and performance in secondary earth science.

T1  - An evaluation of meaningful learning in a high school chemistry course
AN  - 622060606; 2009-99031-225
AB  - This study utilized an action research methodology to examine students' understandings of science knowledge, and meaningful learning using the SLD (Science Lecture Demonstration) and laboratory instructional method in a high school chemistry classroom. This method was a modification of the Science Lecture Demonstration Method as developed by Majerich and Schmuckler (2004, in press), the modification due to the addition of a laboratory component. The participants in this study represented a convenience sample which included one class of twenty-two, middle to high socio-economic status students (Mean family income over $75,000/year in 2005 U.S. dollars) in an honors chemistry course at a public high school in the state of New Jersey. These participants included nine girls and thirteen boys. The results of this study indicated what the students' understandings of science knowledge were, how the understandings differed among students, and to what extent those understandings were indicative of meaningful learning. These results were obtained by careful analysis of student generated concept maps, narratives from demonstration quizzes, laboratory reports, and test questions, as well as a teacher/researcher reflection upon the classroom experience. A simple taxonomy for analyzing students' understandings of science knowledge was developed, based upon the work of Majerich (2004). Findings indicated that the students' understanding of science knowledge, as well as the extent of meaningful learning that occurs in the chemistry classroom may be influenced by the roles of: explicit directions, pre-existing knowledge from elementary and middle school science classes, using examples vs. non-examples, macroscopic vs. microscopic views of nature, time for reflection, and everyday vs. scientific language. Results obtained from high school student responses confirmed Novak's observation of elementary students' lack of differentiation between the terms vapor and gas (Novak, 1998).

T1  - Using the BioDatamation™ strategy to learn introductory college biology: Value-added effects on selected students' conceptual understanding and conceptual integration of the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration
AN  - 622053873; 2009-99051-146
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory research was to study how students learn photosynthesis and cellular respiration and to determine the value added to the student's learning by each of the three technology-scaffolded learning strategy components (animated concept presentations and WebQuest-style activities, data collection, and student-constructed animations) of the BioDatamation™ (BDM) Program. BDM learning strategies utilized the Theory of Interacting Visual Fields™ (TIVF) (Reuter & Wandersee, 2002a, 2002b; 2003a, 2003b) which holds that meaningful knowledge is hierarchically constructed using the past, present, and future visual fields, with visual metacognitive components that are derived from the principles of Visual Behavior (Jones, 1995), Human Constructivist Theory (Mintzes & Wandersee, 1998a), and Visual Information Design Theory (Tufte, 1990, 1997, 2001). Student alternative conceptions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration were determined by the item analysis of 263,267 Biology Advanced Placement Examinations and were used to develop the BDM instructional strategy and interview questions. The subjects were 24 undergraduate students of high and low biology prior knowledge enrolled in an introductory-level General Biology course at a major research university in the Deep South. Fifteen participants received BDM instruction which included original and innovative learning materials and laboratories in 6 phases; 8 of the 15 participants were the subject of in depth, extended individual analysis. The other 9 participants received traditional, non-BDM instruction. Interviews which included participants’ creation of concept maps and visual field diagrams were conducted after each phase. Various content analyses, including Chi's Verbal Analysis and quantitizing/qualitizing were used for data analysis. The total value added to integrative knowledge during BDM instruction with the three visual fields was an average increase of 56% for cellular respiration and 62% increase for photosynthesis knowledge, improved long-term memory of concepts, and enhanced biological literacy to the multidimensional level, as determined by the BSCS literacy model. WebQuest-style activities and data collection provided for animated prior knowledge in the past visual field, and detailed content knowledge construction in the present visual field. During student construction of animated presentations, layering required participants to think by rearranging words and images for improved hierarchical organization of knowledge with real-life applications.

T1  - Conceptual change in pre-service science teachers' views on nature of science when learning a unit on the physics of waves
AN  - 622049554; 2009-99011-039
AB  - Recent reform efforts in science education have culminated in National Science Education Standards (NSES), which include the nature of science and science inquiry themes across all grade levels. Consideration must be given to pre-service science teachers’ nature of science conceptions and their perceived roles in implementing the nature of science in the science classroom. This qualitative study investigates how pre-service science teachers’ views about the nature of science develop and change when learning a college physics unit on waves in an urban university. The study uses case study methodology with four pre-service science teachers as individual units of analysis. Data regarding the participants’ views about the nature of science were collected before and after the instruction on the physics of waves unit. The research design used ‘The Views of Nature of Science/Views of Scientific Inquiry-Physics Questionnaire’ followed by structured interviews throughout the wave unit. In addition, the participants responded to daily questions that incorporated nature of science themes and constructed concept maps regarding the physics content and their nature of science understanding. After completing the VNOS/VOSI-PHYS questionnaire the pre-service science teachers’ views of the nature of science were found to be mainly naïve and transitional before the instruction. At the end of the wave unit instruction, the data indicated that conceptual change occurred in participants’ nature of science views, shifting toward informed views. The findings of this study provide evidence that using explicit instruction with specific activities, such as experiments and concept mapping, shifted the pre-service science teachers’ views away from naïve and toward informed.

T1  - Scientific concept development in the English language arts classroom
AN  - 622039514; 2009-99011-092
AB  - This study uses discourse analysis to examine how scientific concepts (Vygotsky, 1997) develop in an English Language Arts class over the course of one curricular unit. The study focuses on how two students in one 12 
th grade English Language Arts classroom develop towards the scientific concept of summary. The study examines the teacher’s classroom discussion of the concept of summary, and the students’ development of the concept of summary. The development is investigated using Systemic Functional Linguistics to analyze the classroom and interview talk from both teacher and students. The use of concept mapping and SFL analysis (Halliday, 1994) focus on transitivity, interpersonal metaphor, and clause linking devices to enhance, elaborate, or expand the concept’s web of relations. Understanding the initial developmental level of the concept helped to examine how the teacher’s discourse surrounding the concept mediated the concept of summary. Language and schooling as a part of the teaching and learning context and pedagogical issues are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Measuring the quality of e-learning
AN  - 621591408; 2008-15192-008
AB  - This paper shows how concept mapping can be used to measure the quality of e-learning. Six volunteers (all of them 3rd-year medical students) took part in a programme of e-learning designed to teach the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The quality of change in individuals’ maps was assessed using criteria developed to distinguish between meaningful and rote-learning outcomes. Student maps were also scored for evidence of conceptual richness and understanding. Finally, each map was compared directly with the content of the electronic teaching material. The results show that many of the student misconceptions were put right in the course of their learning but that many of the key concepts introduced in the teaching were ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote) by the students. This was because the teaching material locked these new ideas in structures and terminology that precluded meaning-making among non-experts. Our data suggest that students’ prior knowledge is a key determinant of meaningful learning. We suggest that this must be acknowledged if the design and use of electronic teaching material is also to be meaningful. Ultimately, measures of student learning are the only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching through technology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Are high-coherent concept maps better for prior knowledge activation? Differential effects of concept mapping tasks on high school vs. University students
AN  - 622168487; 2008-12942-005
AB  - We investigated whether and how prior knowledge activation improves learning outcomes for high school (less experienced learners) and university students (experienced learners) in a hypertext environment. Map coherence was defined as the extent to which relationships between the concepts in the map were made explicit. Therefore, we classified the mapping task of creating and labelling lines as low-coherent, and the mapping task of labelling provided lines as high-coherent. Learners were randomly assigned to the conditions of (1) high-coherent knowledge activation; (2) low-coherent knowledge activation; and (3) a baseline condition without prior knowledge activation. We found an overall effect for prior knowledge activation, learning experience, and an interaction between learning experience and the coherence of the prior knowledge activation task on learning outcomes. High school students benefited most from labelling provided lines, while university physics majors benefited most from creating and labelling lines. This interaction effect and effects of the specific mapping tasks on process measures support the claim that different prior knowledge activation tasks are suited for different groups of learners.

T1  - The effect of using concept maps as study tools on achievement in chemistry
AN  - 621567906; 2008-14015-005
AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine whether or not the construction of concept maps by students improves their achievement and ability to solve higher order questions in chemistry, (2) investigate the differential effect of the treatment by gender and achievement level, and (3) explore the relationships between performance on concept maps and chemistry achievement. Participants were 60 tenth-grade students randomly divided into two groups. The study spanned six weeks in a class that met five times a week. The material covered was acid-base titration and equilibrium in weak acids. The students were pre- and post-tested using a teacher-constructed chemistry test. Results showed that while there were no significant differences on the achievement total score, there were significant differences favoring the experimental group for scores on the knowledge level questions. Moreover, there were sex-achievement interactions at the knowledge and comprehension level questions favoring females and achievement level—achievement interactions favoring low achievers. Finally, there were significant correlations between students’ scores on high level questions and the convergence and total concept map scores.

T1  - The effects of a concept map-based information display in an electronic portfolio system on information processing and retention in a fifth-grade science class covering the Earth's atmosphere
AN  - 622085654; 2008-09608-009
AB  - An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio. The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth’s atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the 3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time). Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may reduce overall system access time; while higher math proficiency may predict retention scores.

Journal of Environmental Education, 2008[Spr], Vol 39[3], 32-46). In the original article, Figures 3 and 4 were printed incorrectly. A complimentary replacement copy of the article with corrected figures is available online. Please e-mail jee@heldref.org to request access. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2008-10989-003). Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, the authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing the inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between the concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A pilot study of an online workplace nutrition program: The value of participant input in program development
AN  - 621954854; 2008-05813-003
AB  - Objective: Tailored nutrition Web programs constitute an emerging trend in obesity prevention. Initial investment in innovative technology necessitates that the target population be well understood. This pilot study's purpose was to determine the feasibility of a workplace nutrition Web program. Design: Formative research was conducted with gaming industry employees and benefits managers to develop a consensus on workplace-specific nutrition needs. A demonstration Web program was piloted with stakeholders to determine feasibility. Setting: Indiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and New Jersey gaming establishments. Participants: 86 employees, 18 benefits managers. Intervention: Prototype Web program. Main Outcome Measures: Concept mapping; 16-item nutrition knowledge test; satisfaction. Analysis: Concept mapping was used to aggregate importance ratings on programmatic content, which informed Web program curriculum. Chi-square tests were performed postintervention to determine knowledge improvement. Results: (1) Employees and benefits managers exhibited moderate agreement about content priorities for the program (r = 0.48). (2) There was a significant increase in employees' nutrition knowledge scores postintervention (t = 7.16, df = 36, P < .001); those with less knowledge exhibited the greatest gains in knowledge scores (r = -0.647, P < 001). Conclusions and Implications: Employees and benefit managers do not necessarily agree on the priority of nutrition-related content, suggesting a need for programs to appeal to various stakeholders. Computer-based approaches can address various stakeholder health concerns via tailored, customized programming. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - [Correction Notice: An erratum for this article was reported in Vol 39(4) of 
Journal of Environmental Education (see record 2008-13400-005). In the original article, Figures 3 and 4 were printed incorrectly. A complimentary replacement copy of the article with corrected figures is available online. Please e-mail jee@heldref.org to request access.] Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, the authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing the inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between the concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Learning about seasons in a technologically enhanced environment: The impact of teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches on the process of students' conceptual change
AN  - 622116034; 2008-02347-006
AB  - To explore the ways in which teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches influence students' conceptual understanding of seasonal change, we designed a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) course to compare, by means of concept maps, the learning outcome of students in two groups: a teacher-guided (TG) class (with whole-class presentations) and a student-centered (SC) class (with individual online learning). The participants were two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this technologically enhanced environment, the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F = 28.05, p < 0.001). The conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change. The student-centered approach allows students to more freely test their own hypotheses in the processes of exploration and modeling, and thus move from assimilatory to properly scientific explanations.

T1  - Guided Field Observations: Variables related to preservice teachers' knowledge about effective primary reading instruction
AN  - 621967391; 2008-06271-002
AB  - Relations between preservice teachers' guided field observations of primary literacy instruction and knowledge about effective beginning reading practices were explored. Preservice teachers (n = 48) participated in a Directed Field Experience course including instruction on and observations of exemplary teaching practices promoting student engagement and literacy achievement. Correlations, calculated between the quantity of exemplary reading instruction practices observed by preservice teachers and the accuracy of observations with their knowledge about effective beginning literacy instruction, suggest guided field observations of exemplary practices may positively impact preservice teachers' knowledge of effective early literacy instruction. Observing more exemplary practices was associated with preservice teachers' knowledge acquisition represented in concept maps (r = .368; p = .015). Practices promoting a generally motivating classroom atmosphere were more readily understood by preservice teachers than intricate subtleties of motivating literacy instruction.

T1  - A comparative study of the effect of collaborative problem-solving in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) on individual achievement
AN  - 621760695; 2008-99231-150
AB  - Since the early 2000s, significant attention has been given to the academic potential of a new type of online game called Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) that take place in 3-dimensional (3D) immersive persistent worlds. MMOGs are believed to hold significant promise for educators because they provide for the player (learner) rich learning opportunities that exemplify quality-learning experiences but there is little empirical research and published work on MMOGs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of collaborative problem solving during MMOG play on the individual achievement (posttest and concept-map construction scores) of 159 sixth-grade students. There were four comparison groups of existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=100): two taught by the researcher and two taught by the regular sixth-grade science teacher and an experimental group of two existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=59) taught by the researcher. During the 8-day investigation, the experimental group played Web Earth Online, an ecology-based MMOG, and the comparison group received traditional instruction that included multimedia-rich, hands-on, collaborative activities to learn about the life cycle and survival needs of the Eastern Bluebird. A content analysis of the log files of player dialog to assess player collaborative teamwork during MMOG play was utilized. A dependent-samples t test and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to examine the differences in performance between the experimental and comparison groups on the content knowledge assessment and concept-map construction task. A correlation of frequencies was utilized to examine the relationship between collaborative teamwork-strategy scores of students in the MMOG group and posttest and concept-map scores. Satisfaction surveys were administered to examine game and unit satisfaction. Results of the analysis showed that individuals who participated in the experimental group tended to have statistically significant lower posttest scores than students in the comparison group taught by the researcher (based on the 33-item test results) or in the comparison group taught by the teacher (based on the more reliable 17-item test results). Although no statistically significant differences were found in the scores from the experimental group, a statistically significant difference between pre- and posttest was found for the whole sample. Descriptive statistics indicated that learning growth occurred in both groups as evidenced by the pre-and posttest difference in means. Moreover, nonsignificant differences among the three groups in terms of concept-map scores were observed. An analysis of the chat log files of the MMOG participants revealed that only 30% of the chats involved collaboration, with the more common strategies being Communication, Leadership, and Interpersonal. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between usage of Leadership strategies and posttest scores. Findings from correlation results show that there is a high degree of interitem correlation between the collaborative strategies identified for the study from the chat log files of the experimental group. The percentage of responses of agree and strongly agree that participants learned from the MMOG and the instructional unit are 82%, 58%, and 75% for experimental, researcher's comparison, and teacher's comparison, respectively, with the experimental students overwhelmingly indicated they learned about the Eastern Bluebird. The findings from this study suggested that the educational use of video games, specifically MMOGs, can be a viable pedagogical strategy. Results indicated that Web Earth Online was engaging and motivating for students and that the study indicated that concept maps are appropriate instruments to measure learning in a MMOG.

T1  - Impact of an integrated science and reading intervention (insciread) on bilingual students' misconceptions, reading comprehension, and transferability of strategies
AN  - 621758040; 2008-99230-483
AB  - This thesis describes a research study that resulted in an instructional model directed at helping fourth grade diverse students improve their science knowledge, their reading comprehension, their awareness of the relationship between science and reading, and their ability to transfer strategies. The focus of the instructional model emerged from the intersection of constructs in science and reading literacy; the model identifies cognitive strategies that can be used in science and reading, and inquiry-based instruction related to the science content read by participants. The intervention is termed INSCIREAD (Instruction in Science and Reading). The GoInquire web-based system (2006) was used to develop students' content knowledge in slow landform change. Seventy-eight students participated in the study. The treatment group comprised 49 students without disabilities and 8 students with disabilities. The control group comprised 21 students without disabilities. The design of the study is a combination of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design (Study 1), and a single subject design with groups as the unit of analysis (Study 2). The results from the quantitative measures demonstrated that the text recall data analysis from Study 1 yielded near significant statistical levels when comparing the performance of students without disabilities in the treatment group to that of the control group. Visual analyses of the results from the text recall data from Study 2 showed at least minimal change in all groups. The results of the data analysis of the level of the generated questions show there was a statistically significant increase in the scores students without disabilities obtained in the questions they generated from the pre to the posttest. The analyses conducted to detect incongruities, to summarize and rate importance, and to determine the number of propositions on a science and reading concept map data showed a statistically significant difference between students without disabilities in the treatment and the control groups on post-intervention scores. The analysis of the data from the number of misconceptions of students without disabilities showed that the frequency of 4 of the 11 misconceptions changed significantly from pre to post elicitation stages. The analyses of the qualitative measures of the think alouds and interviews generally supported the above findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of students' asynchronous online discussions of conceptual errors on intentionally flawed teacher-constructed concept maps
AN  - 621756638; 2008-99230-438
AB  - Research shows that online discussions are often unfocused and without providing much benefit to students' learning outcomes. One of the reasons behind this phenomenon is the lack of or inadequate scaffolding or guidance provided to students when participating on asynchronous discussion boards. The collaborative misconception mapping strategy is a tool that was designed to mediate cognitive and metacognitive processes via feedback provided by peers and a teacher-created concept map that contains intentional conceptual errors. This study evaluated the effects of collaborative misconception mapping as compared with those of a traditional online discussion activity, where students post responses to discussion questions. Subjects were 52 undergraduate students in health sciences statistics classes at a large southwestern urban university; 24 in the misconception mapping group and 29 in the traditional discussion group. The level of meaningfulness of students' discussions using a rubric based on an intentional conceptual change model, and their post-test scores were compared. In addition, utilizing mean scores on the Metacognitive Self-regulation subscale of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), the collaborative misconception mapping strategy's effectiveness for students with low self-regulation skills was investigated. Findings indicate that the misconception mapping strategy outperforms the traditional discussion tool, as it provides a self-regulatory scaffold to students, and improves learning outcomes even for those with low levels of self-regulation. The strategy also enhances the meaningfulness of discussions in terms of their reflection of cognitive and metacognitive processes, and promotes more positive learner perceptions regarding the tool itself. It is recommended that instructors reevaluate their online discussion requirements, consider the negative impact unguided online discussions may have on their students' online learning experience, and provide appropriate cognitive and metacognitive scaffolding for optimal learning outcomes.

T1  - Using rock art as an alternative science pedagogy
AN  - 621741616; 2008-99151-001
AB  - College-level and seventh-grade science students were studied to understand the power of a field index, the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI), for student learning about complex biophysical environmental processes. In order to determine if the studied population was representative, 584 college and seventh-grade students undertook a concept mapping exercise after they had learned basic weathering science via in-class lecture. Of this large group, a subset of 322 college students and 13 seventh-grade students also learned RASI through a field experience involving the analysis of rock weathering associated with petroglyphs. After learning weathering through RASI, students completed another concept map. This was a college population where roughly 46% had never taken a "lab science" course and nearly 22% were from minority (non-white) populations. Analysis of student learning through the lens of actor-network theory revealed that when landscape is viewed as process (i.e. many practices), science education embodies both an alternative science philosophy and an alternative materialistic worldview. When RASI components were analyzed after only lecture, student understanding of weathering displayed little connection between weathering form and weathering process. After using RASI in the field however, nearly all students made illustrative concept maps rich in connections between weathering form and weathering process for all subcomponents of RASI. When taken as an aggregate, and measured by an average concept map score, learning increased by almost 14%, Among college minority students, the average score increase approached 23%. Among female students, the average score increase was 16%. For seventh-grade students, scores increased by nearly 36%. After testing for normalcy with Kolmogorov-Smirnov, t-tests reveal that all of these increases were highly statistically significant at p<0.001. The growth in learning weathering science by minority students, as compared to non-minority students, was also statistically significant at p<0.01. These findings reveal the power of field work through RASI to strengthen cognitive linkages between complex biophysical processes and the corresponding rock weathering forms.

T1  - Concept mapping to promote meaningful learning at the community college level
AN  - 621735315; 2008-99110-075
AB  - This concurrent, mixed method study explored the effectiveness of concept mapping and collaborative groups in promoting understanding of ecology at the community college level. The research problems being addressed included students' need to meaningfully understand the relevance of human's effects on the environment and teachers' needs to find engaging, active strategies that promote permanent integration of knowledge by their pupils. The key research questions investigate group versus individual map construction and its effect on understanding and map quality improvement. Prior research shows conflicting conclusions related to mapping and group success and very little research has been conducted looking at map quality through practice. Students from two sections of human ecology were assessed of their ecology understanding by a pre- and posttest design over a semester and also first and last concept maps were collected and assessed. The study results showed no statistically significant difference (using a t test) between (a) posttest scores of students individually constructing maps compared to students who constructed in groups and (b) map quality from beginning to the end of the semester between the individual and group constructors. During the data analysis, all students collectively showed a significant improvement from pre- to posttest scores. Improved quality of maps constructed from the beginning to the end of the semester of all students was not supported quantitatively, but the qualitative analysis showed some overall improvement. Social change will come from providing accurate knowledge for students to use for decisions related to environmental problems and by creating more critical thinkers because of a variety of learning strategies in schools, as well as teachers' increased use of concept mapping for improved student learning.

T1  - The effects of a professional development Geoscience education institute upon secondary school science teachers in Puerto Rico

AB  - The geographic and geologic settings of Puerto Rico served as the context to develop a mixed methods investigation on: (1) the effects of a five-day long constructivist and field-based earth science education professional development institute upon 26 secondary school science teachers' earth science conceptual knowledge, perceptions of fieldwork, and beliefs about teaching earth science; and (2) the implementation of participants' newly acquired knowledge and experience in their science lessons at school. Qualitative data included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, reflective journals, pre-post concept maps, and pre-post lesson plans. The Geoscience Concept Inventory and the Science Outdoor Learning Environment Inventory were translated into Spanish and culturally validated to collect quantitative data. Data was analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory methodology, descriptive statistics, and non-parametric methods. Participants came to the institute with serious deficiencies in earth science conceptual understanding, negative earth science teaching perspectives, and inadequate earth science teaching methodologies. The institute helped participants to improve their understanding of earth science concepts, content, and processes mostly related to the study of rocks, the Earth's structure, plate tectonics, maps, and the geology of Puerto Rico. Participants also improved their earth science teaching beliefs, perceptions on field-based education, and reflected on their environmental awareness and social responsibility. Participants greatly benefited from the field-based learning environment, inquiry-based teaching approaches modeled, the attention given to their affective domain, and reflections on their teaching practice as part of the institute's activities. The constructivist learning environment and the institute's contextualized and meaningful learning conceptual model were effective in generating interest and confidence in earth science teaching. Some participants successfully integrated inquiry-based lessons on the nature of science and earth science at their schools, but were unsuccessful in integrating field trips. The lack of teacher education programs and the inadequacy of earth science conceptual and pedagogical understanding held by in-service teachers are the main barriers for effective earth science teaching in Puerto Rico. This study established a foundation for future earth science education projects for Latino teachers. Additionally, as a result of this investigation various recommendations were made to effectively implement earth science teacher education programs in Puerto Rico and internationally.

T1  - Using concept maps to explore the conceptual knowledge of technology students: An exploratory study
AN  - 621726408; 2008-99071-097
AB  - This study investigates the use of concept maps to explore the conceptual knowledge of technology education students as a result of design and problem-solving activities in an undergraduate technology education class called Energy, Power, and Transportation. The research questions were: (1) What concepts and propositions are revealed through the concept maps before the instruction and design and problem-solving activity in the technology education classroom? (2) What concepts and propositions are revealed through the concept maps as a result of design and problem-solving activity in the technology education classroom? and (3) Will a comparison of the student generated pre and post concept maps relate to the standards for technology education, other technology education taxonomies, and/or the teacher's intent? This study is based on a qualitative research methodology with quantitative data that was used to strengthen the qualitative interpretations. The quantitative data was generated from the comparison of the technology education students' pre and post concept maps. Evidence was also collected from several sources related to the three design and problem-solving activities conducted in an undergraduate technology education teacher education course called Energy, Power, and Transportation I. The evidence included the following: student's pre and post concept maps, the instructor's concept maps, participant observations, semi-structured interviews with the students and the instructor, semi-structured interviews with the students via instant messaging, and documentation of the student's write ups, and the instructor's handouts and lesson plans. A constructivist perspective was utilized in this study to help interpret the evidence collected throughout this study. The findings suggested that the student generated pre-concept maps prior to the design and problem-solving activities revealed students' utilization of their pre-existing knowledge, either from previous courses or from other design and problem-solving activities to generate their pre-concept maps. The pre-concept maps also revealed preconceptions or misconceptions the students held in regard to the knowledge domain. The post-concept maps, observations, interviews, and write-ups/evaluations suggested that the students learned and developed technology concepts as a result of the design and problem-solving activities through meaningful learning and through the problem-solving process in a constructivist learning theory.

T1  - Understanding of earth and space science concepts: Strategies for concept building in elementary teacher preparation
AN  - 621718275; 2008-99030-578
AB  - Research on conceptual change provides strong evidence that not only children but also many adults have incorrect or incomplete understanding of science concepts. This mixed methods study was concerned with preservice and inservice teachers' understanding of six earth and space science concepts commonly taught in elementary school: reasons for seasons, phases of the moon, reasons for the wind, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. The first part of the study determined and compared the level of conceptual understanding held by both groups on topics they will need to teach in the Georgia Performance Standards [GPS]. The second part focused on whether readings or hands-on learning stations, in some cases combined with concept mapping, improves preservice teachers' understanding of these concepts. The third part described the application of conceptual change strategies of one group of preservice teachers during their field placements. The overall sample was two cohorts of preservice teachers, one cohort of preservice teachers from an alternative initial certification program, and two masters' cohorts consisting of inservice teachers. Four data sources were: a six item open-ended survey, concept maps, the field assignments, and the researcher's field notes. Rubrics were used to score answers to each survey question. Concept map scores were calculated based on the criteria developed by Novak and Gowin (1984). The first part of the study shows that both preservice and inservice teachers have low conceptual understanding of the earth science concepts taught in elementary school. Independent samples t-tests results indicate that both groups have similar understanding about these concepts. A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. A paired samples t-test shows that concept mapping added to the participants' conceptual understanding whether the participants learned the concepts through readings or stations. Finally, field assignments allowed the participants to apply knowledge that they learned in their science methods course in their classroom placements. This study has implications for teacher preparation programs, staff development, and conceptual change practices in field placements. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Improving high school physical science students' understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum: A modified diagram approach
AN  - 621713342; 2008-99011-031
AB  - The focus of this study was to identify major conceptual difficulties that selected public high school physical science students encounter in understanding a standard electromagnetic spectrum diagram. A research-driven, modified version of that standard diagram was used in this study to determine the value added to student understanding of electromagnetic waves. A content analysis was performed on electromagnetic spectrum diagrams found in US textbooks from the 1950s through the present. A class of public high school physical science students participated in a study consisting of four activities conducted during a three-week unit. Students were given a pre- and post-achievement test and a pre- and post-survey on the regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the conclusion of each activity, selected students were interviewed and each co-constructed a concept map with the researcher. The Electromagnetic Spectrum Literacy Rubric (ESLR) was designed and used to assess students' conceptual understanding periodically as they proceeded through the unit study. A mixed methods analysis was performed, employing both qualitative and quantitative data. A paired t-test determined that there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.014) between the pre- and post-achievement test scores for the class of students participating in the unit study. Effect sizes also determined that students have difficulties with mathematical calculations and wave properties. These topics present conceptual challenges which must be overcome to understand and use an electromagnetic spectrum diagram effectively. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Medical students' perceptions of the utility of concept mapping
AN  - 621713029; 2008-99010-592
AB  - Concept mapping is being introduced into traditional medical education as a tool to help students integrate information and learn meaningfully. There is strong theoretical support for concept mapping, but studies have determined that a substantial proportion of students do not perceive concept mapping to be useful. 182 medical students at St. George's University took the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and completed an original questionnaire examining student perceptions of concept mapping and perceptions of a range of factors which have been proposed to influence perceptions of the usefulness of the strategy. The results of this study provide support for the assertion that concept mapping can be a useful learning tool for some students, even in a traditional basic science medical curriculum. However, it also provides evidence that a substantial percent of students do not find concept mapping to be useful in this context. MBTI Personality type, perceptions of the learning environment and perceptions of the implementation of concept mapping were found to be related to perceptions of usefulness and use of the strategy.

T1  - Genetics instruction with history of science: Nature of science learning
AN  - 621712486; 2008-99011-081
AB  - This study explored the effect of history of genetics in teaching genetics and learning the nature of science (NOS). A quasi-experimental control group research design with pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests was used, combining qualitative data and quantitative data. Two classes which consisted of tenth grade biology students participated in this study. The present study involved two instructional interventions, Best Practice Instruction with History of Genetics (BPIw/HG) and Best Practice Instruction (BPI). The experimental group received BPIw/HG utilizing various historical materials from the history of genetics, while the control group was not introduced to historical materials. Scientific Attitude Inventory II, Genetics Terms' Definitions with Concept Mapping (GTDCM), NOS Terms' Definitions with Concept Mapping (NTDCM), and View of Nature of Science (VNOS-C) were used to investigate students' scientific attitude inventory, and their understanding of genetics as well as the NOS. The results showed that students' scientific attitude inventory, and their understanding of genetics and the NOS were not statistically significantly different in the pretest (p>.05). After the intervention, the experimental group of students who received BPIw/HG demonstrated better understanding of the NOS. NTDCM results showed that the experimental group was better in defining the NOS terms and constructing a concept map ( p<.01). In addition, the experimental group retained their understanding of the NOS two-months after the completion of the intervention, showing no statistically significant difference between the posttest and the delayed posttest of NTDCM (p>.05). Further, VNOS-C data indicated that a greater percentage of the experimental group than the control group improved their understanding of the NOS. However, the two groups' understanding of genetics concepts did not show any statistically significant difference in the pretest, the posttest, and the delayed posttest (p>.05).

T1  - Comparing computer-supported dynamic modeling and 'paper & pencil' concept mapping technique in students' collaborative activity
AN  - 621858130; 2007-12994-004
AB  - This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the 'paper & pencil' concept mapping technique and the computer-supported educational environment '
ModelsCreator'. Students' shared activity in both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and also identify the activity's similar and different aspects in each one. Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of which concerns the 
process of collaboratively creating a plant growth model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process has been derived within the theoretical framework of '
activity theory' on the basis of the 
OCAF scheme for 
basic modeling operations and the scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (1998). Secondary students' dynamic modeling processes: analyzing, reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems. 
Journal of Science Education and Technology, 7(3), 215-234.] for 
higher-order modeling actions. According to our results, four major 
modeling actions (
analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of 
modeling operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed.

T1  - Concept mapping in a financial accounting theory course
AN  - 622221512; 2008-12000-001
AB  - This paper assesses the usefulness of concept mapping (an educational learning, assessment, and curriculum development technique developed by Novak, widely used in the natural sciences) within an accounting education context. It shows how an accounting-based concept map can be constructed by students and educators to provide a visual, conceptually transparent graphical representation of an individual’s understanding of a particular knowledge domain. The method is firmly routed in Ausubel’s theory of meaningful learning and its emphasis upon the hierarchical structure of concepts is particularly relevant to accounting. While concept mapping has been used extensively in many (particularly science) disciplines, it has received relatively little attention within accounting education. The paper’s contribution is to extend its application within an accounting education context by focusing upon how concept mapping can enhance students’ learning by evaluating student-prepared concept maps, showing how concept mapping can be used at different levels within a course (i.e. curriculum, topic and activity) and reporting feedback of its use with two cohorts of students, within a financial accounting theory component. The use of educator-prepared concept maps, with concepts omitted, proved popular as tutorial quiz exercises and increased the quantity and quality of participation. However, students were less willing to construct their own concept maps and engage in meaningful learning. While most students were able to build upon aspects of their prior knowledge, stronger students used a greater range of concepts, a richer set of linkages and more examples than weaker students did. Concept maps were useful in diagnosing students’ and instructors’ misconceptions. Many students found concept mapping relatively easy to use, provided a better understanding of complex issues, liked the visual representation and holistic view, and so supported their learning. However, educators need to become proficient in constructing maps and using appropriate software, not make the maps too complex, provide students with some initial training in the technique and consider the fit between using the techniques as a learning tool and as an assessment tool. While no significant differences were found in the usefulness of the method for students of different ages and gender, Asian students generally found the method to be more useful than did UK students.

T1  - Beyond ontologies: Toward situated representations of scientific knowledge
AN  - 621763466; 2007-08222-009
AB  - In information systems that support knowledge-discovery applications such as scientific exploration, reliance on highly structured ontologies as data-organization aids can be limiting. With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication--or worse, left unrecorded altogether--for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, allowing end users to evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Proliferation of inscriptions and transformations among preservice science teachers engaged in authentic science
AN  - 621695484; 2007-05352-002
AB  - Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions that economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their science classes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using concept maps to assess change in teachers' understandings of algebra: A respectful approach
AN  - 621882429; 2007-14401-002
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' growth in understanding of algebra using concept maps. The study was set in the context of a five-year National Science Foundation funded teacher retention and renewal professional development project. In this project both beginning and experienced teachers are supported as they increase their understanding about mathematics, their ability to implement effective mathematics practices in their classrooms, and their knowledge of working with English Learners. Results indicate that teachers' algebraic knowledge structures became more complex and connected as a result of their professional development. In addition, they were able to adapt their knowledge networks to incorporate important aspects of algebra into them. Concept maps are recommended to other leaders of mathematics professional development as a means of assessing change. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The comparative effect of individually-generated vs. collaboratively-generated computer-based concept mapping on science concept learning
AN  - 622052795; 2007-99230-384
AB  - Using a quasi-experimental design, the researcher investigated the comparative effects of individually-generated and collaboratively-generated computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. Qualitative data were analyzed to explain quantitative findings. One hundred sixty-one students (74 boys and 87 girls) in eight, seventh grade science classes at a middle school in Southeast Texas completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, the researcher assigned the teacher's classes to one of the three experimental groups. The independent variable, group, consisted of three levels: 40 students in a control group, 59 students trained to individually generate concept maps on computers, and 62 students trained to collaboratively generate concept maps on computers. The dependent variables were science concept learning as demonstrated by comprehension test scores, and quality of concept maps created by students in experimental groups as demonstrated by rubric scores. Students in the experimental groups received concept mapping training and used their newly acquired concept mapping skills to individually or collaboratively construct computer-based concept maps during study time. The control group, the individually-generated concept mapping group, and the collaboratively-generated concept mapping group had equivalent learning experiences for 50 minutes during five days, excepting that students in a control group worked independently without concept mapping activities, students in the individual group worked individually to construct concept maps, and students in the collaborative group worked collaboratively to construct concept maps during their study time. Both collaboratively and individually generated computer-based concept mapping had a positive effect on seventh grade middle school science concept learning but neither strategy was more effective than the other. However, the students who collaboratively generated concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually generated concept maps. The researcher concluded that the concept mapping software, Inspiration, fostered construction of students' concept maps individually or collaboratively for science learning and helped students capture their evolving creative ideas and organize them for meaningful learning. Students in both the individual and the collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software.

T1  - The urban environment and physical activity: Factors impacting adolescents' use of recreational facilities
AN  - 622034069; 2007-99200-396
AB  - Aims. The aims of this research are (1) to qualitatively investigate environmental factors influencing both physical activity and recreational facility use for physical activity and (2) to identify and test the statistical significance of associations between park use and objective and perceived measures of the environment. Methods. Data were collected from students at two predominately African American magnet high schools in Baltimore, Maryland. Multiple qualitative methods were used to address the first aim. First, concept mapping was conducted with 50 adolescents to elicit and rate the importance of environmental factors influencing physical activity. Next, 48 in-depth interviews and 26 direct observations were conducted to explore factors influencing the use of parks and recreation centers for physical activity. To address the second aim, survey data collected from 329 adolescents and Geographical Information Systems data assessing neighborhood park availability and crime were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between park use and objective and perceived environmental characteristics. Results. Adolescents identified seven domains that they perceive of as influencing their physical activity. The relative importance of these domains varied by gender. Young women rated negative social influences, such as crime and violence, as most important to physical activity while young men rated social support and physical activity settings as most important. Adolescents reported several factors that impact facility use, including the presence of adolescent-oriented facilities, maintenance, proximity to home, and cost. The social environment is a key factor, as adolescents prefer safe facilities where they find other active adolescents. The quantitative analysis revealed that objective environmental measures, including park availability and neighborhood crime, were not associated with park use. Several self-reported measures, including increased park availability, park quality, and park use by peers and family, were positively associated with park use. Perceived neighborhood crime, however, was not associated with park use. Conclusions. This research underscores the relevance of program and policy efforts that aim to promote physical activity through modifications to the environment. Moreover, it highlights the need to develop multi-level intervention approaches that address characteristics of the social and physical environments as well as adolescents' perceptions of the environment.

T1  - An examination of the effect of teacher read-aloud on adolescent attitudes and learning in science
AN  - 622026012; 2007-99190-211
AB  - Having been established as an important component of early literacy development, the use of teacher read-aloud as an instructional strategy has the potential to benefit adolescent students. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect teacher read-aloud had on adolescent learning in science and how the results varied according to individual reading ability. The study was a counterbalanced design gathering both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis from two treatment procedures. Seventh and eighth grade students were given the reading portion of the SAT-9 to provide a national percentile ranking in reading. All students then participated in two consecutive units of study: one unit requiring students to read the science text silently and the second unit providing a teacher read-aloud of all text. The classroom procedures, assignments, and related activities were exactly the same for both treatments. Student learning was measured with pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest concept map scores on each unit of study. A survey administered at the end of the study examined student attitudes toward the teacher read-aloud and served as the source for in-depth interviews concerning preference for or dislike of the teacher read-aloud strategy. An interview with the science teacher provided another outlook on the oral reading treatment. A repeated measures analysis suggested both teacher read-aloud and silent reading were appropriate for student learning but results do not support either method as superior over the other. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on the posttest and delayed posttest scores as the dependent measured, had a significant relationship between treatment by reading ability interaction on one analysis. Regression equations constructed for each level of the treatment indicated that as reading ability increases, students received more benefits from the teacher read-aloud procedure. A correlation compared reading ability with attitude toward teacher read-aloud. Seventy-eight of the participants had a positive attitude toward the intervention, with no students reading below the 50th percentile showing disapproval. Interview responses supported these results since all below average readers favor the oral presentation. Overall themes from the interviews offered advantages and disadvantages of teacher read-aloud, suggestions for implementation, and a teacher's perspective on practical applications in science classes.

AB  - This article reports the findings of Phase II of our study of student use of web-based tutorial materials for general chemistry and student understanding of chemistry concepts. We have found that students who use the web site valued the aspects of visualization of chemistry concepts and availability of materials online. In our analysis of student understanding of chemistry concepts by way of concept maps, we found that students who used the web site showed a similar level of understanding of chemistry to that of the students who did not use the web site, but that the web site users attempted to make more concept map links about the relevant chemistry concepts. Similarly to our finding in Phase I of the study, most students thought that the Web was a good way to get help learning chemistry. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A mixed methods analysis of learning in online teacher professional development: A case report
AN  - 621898455; 2007-15159-004
AB  - Web-based learning has been proposed as a convenient way to provide professional development experiences. Despite quantitative evidence that online instruction is equivalent to traditional methods (Russell, 2001), the efficiency of this approach has not been extensively studied among teachers. This case report describes learning in an online biology course designed to help teachers prepare for science certification exams. A mixed methodology approach was utilized to analyze the manner in which course participants learned and how the online environment influenced this process. Concept maps scored by two different methods and objective pre- and postcourse examinations were contrasted as representations of assimilated knowledge, while unstructured interviews reflected participants' perceptions of their experiences. Findings indicate that participants experienced gains in declarative knowledge, but little improvement with respect to more complex levels of understanding. Qualitative examination of concept maps demonstrated gaps in participants' understandings of key course ideas. Engagement in the use of online resources varied according to participants' attitudes toward online learning. Subjects also reported a lack of motivation to fully engage in the course due to busy schedules, lack of extrinsic rewards, and the absence of personal accountability.

T1  - The erroneous derivative examples of eleventh grade students
AN  - 621714268; 2007-06487-014
AB  - The derivative is not only an important subject for mathematics but also is an important subject for engineering, physics, economy, chemistry, and statistics. Especially, mathematics depends on strongly preceding learning and the subject of derivative will be used in university education by all students. Therefore, it is one of the most important subjects. This study's purpose is to explore student mistakes and errors in derivative and determine the areas in which students have probable misconceptions. For this purpose, 7 questions were chosen from "the Student Placement Test" (OSS). These questions were transferred into open-ended questions. The results of the study took place at sixth form college are described and discussed. The test administered to 53 students from Balikesir Fatma Emin Kutvar Anatolian High School in the fall-term of 2005-2006. Determining the possible misconceptions should help teachers when they teach this subject. The study findings showed that students could not understand derivative definition that depends on limit, make mistakes in composite functions and trigonometric functions, and establish wrong relations between tangent's slope, and normal's slope. Teachers need to be able to find errors and misconceptions in students' solutions. Teachers also need to be applying meaningful learning strategies such as concept maps, worksheets about derivative (e.g. Appendix B, Appendix C).

T1  - Learning with concept and knowledge maps: A meta-analysis
AN  - 621773821; 2007-08778-004
AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which students learned by constructing, modifying, or viewing node-link diagrams. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.

T1  - Contextual Assessment in Science Education: Background, Issues, and Policy
AN  - 621387566; 2006-10414-004
AB  - Contemporary assessment practices in science education have undergone significant changes in recent decades. The basis for these changes and the resulting new assessment practices are the subject of this two-part paper. Part 1 considers the basis of assessment that, more than 25 years ago, was driven by the assumptions of decomposability and decontextualization of knowledge, resulting in a low-inference testing system, often described as "traditional." This assessment model was replaced not on account of direct criticism, but rather on account of a larger revolution--the change from behavioral to cognitive psychology, developments in the philosophy of science, and the rise of constructivism. Most notably, the study of the active cognitive processes of the individual resulted in a major emphasis on context in learning and assessment. These changes gave rise to the development of various contextual assessment methodologies in science education, for example, concept mapping assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment. In Part 2, the literature relating to the assessment methods identified in Part 1 is reviewed, revealing that there is not much research that supports their validity and reliability. However, encouraging new work on selected-response tests is forming the basis for reconsideration of past criticisms of this technique. Despite the major developments in contextual assessment methodologies in science education, two important questions remain unanswered, namely, whether grades can be considered as genuine numeric quantities and whether the individual student is the appropriate unit of assessment in public accountability. Given these issues and the requirement for science assessment to satisfy the goals of the individual, the classroom, and the society, tentative recommendations are put forward addressing these parallel needs in the assessment of science learning.

AB  - An experiment was performed to understand the use of Intellectual Capital in a knowledge-based organization. A theoretical model was created; it interconnects the Intellectual Capital components as a way of understanding the intellectual wealth of a learning organization. Hypotheses were formulated from this. Data were then collected at two different time periods. These were then analysed using two scientific tools: concept mapping and structural equations modeling. Both were found to provide valuable information in studying Intellectual Capital in a knowledge-based firm. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept Mapping to Measure Outcomes in Study Abroad Programs
AN  - 621477918; 2006-13404-007
AB  - Faculty efforts to measure outcomes in study abroad programs typically fall short of current expectations for measurable results and increased competencies. Part of the problem stems from the dual challenge of conducting rigorous, objective assessment of these programs without losing the rich, subjective meaning of the cultural experience for student growth and development. The concept mapping method developed by Trochim is a potentially powerful tool for overcoming this challenge, allowing evaluators to utilize qualitative and quantitative research designs simultaneously. This paper illustrates the use of the method in an American social work study abroad program based in Mexico. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The efficacy of concept mapping in aural skills training
AN  - 621652166; 2006-99005-033
AB  - It was the purpose of this study to explore if there is a more effective way to practice aural skills, one that could be individualized as well as computer based: a method of practice that would enhance what the instructor does in the classroom and help the student reinforce their recognition of the basic elements of aural skills and dictation. Concept mapping, which has been beneficial in other educational settings, especially math and science, might be such a way. The goal of this study was to examine if this procedure could be applied to aural stimuli in the same way it has been applied to verbal information. Sixty-four students in a first year college aural skills class were randomly assigned to two groups. Following a pretest of twenty-five chords randomly chosen from a pool of fifty, one group was presented with a lesson on concept mapping while listening to the chords and the other group received a distractor task. The results of these tests showed a higher gain score for the treatment group, M = 5.33, than for the control group, M = 1.25. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), showed a moderately significant gain of p = .030 (one-tailed) for the treatment group. Overall, the test results indicated a positive effect of the treatment on the ability of the participants to recognize chords in the posttest. Due to the limitations in the present study, more research is suggested to determine the effectiveness of the process. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Contentious Issues in Science Education: Building Critical Thinking Patterns Through Two-dimensional Concept Mapping
AN  - 621469952; 2006-20048-004
AB  - Using a survey and follow-up qualitative research design, an elaborate model of technology integration has been studied in a science education classroom. Using a coding system known as cognotes, teacher-interns were first taught how to recognize electronic discussion contributions consisting specifically of critical approaches such as compare, contrast, cause and effect, inductive and deductive reasoning. An electronic concept map outlining the instructor's consideration of a contentious issue (creationism vs. evolution) was supplied to students. Students further developed concept maps (using Inspiration® software) in two ways: (a) students hyperlinked the individual concepts in their map to html-based learning logs and (b) students hyperlinked their own relational phrases between concepts to "captured" electronic discussions. The impact of the instructional approach was assessed through a survey of 68 students, standardized semi-structured interviews, and focus group methodology. Students were especially positive with regard to using a two-dimensional hyperlinked graphic organizer to lend a framework to their understanding of a contentious issue in science education. With regard to electronic discussion, students identified improvements in (a) their ability to formulate arguments, (b) their ability to lead effective discussions, and (c) their ability to substantiate their conceptual frameworks. The technology-integration model described is generic in its application and could be used with a variety of content knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Determining the Exchangeability of Concept Map and Problem-Solving Essay Scores
AN  - 621171970; 2006-04570-005
AB  - This study investigated the score exchangeability of concept maps with problem-solving essays. Of interest was whether sixth-grade students' concept maps predicted their scores on essay responses that used concept map content. Concept maps were hypothesized to be alternatives to performance assessments for content-area domain knowledge in science. Both special (n = 16) and general (n = 16) education students participated in a science unit that covered three ecosystem cycles: (a) the water cycle, (b) the nitrogen cycle, and (c) the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle. Assessment tasks required students to draw three concept maps and respond to two essay questions. Results showed that concept maps and essay tasks lacked consistent exchangeability. Findings indicated low predictive validity between map scores and essay scores and, thus, maps should not be considered alternative content-area domain assessments.

T1  - Designing navigation support in hypertext systems based on navigation patterns
AN  - 621145041; 2006-03776-004
AB  - In this paper, we present two studies designed to help students navigate effectively and learn from a hypertext system, CoMPASS. Our first study (W=74) involved an analysis of students' navigation patterns to group them into clusters, using a k-means clustering technique. Based on this analysis, navigation patterns were grouped into four clusters, enabling us to understand the kinds of support that students needed. This formed the basis of our next study, in which we designed and implemented metanavigation support to help students navigate and learn science content. Support in the form of prompts was provided to one group (N= 58) while a second group (N= 58) with no support served as the comparison group. Our results suggest that students in the support group performed better on a concept-mapping task. Based on the results we provide suggestions for providing metacognitive support in hypertext systems. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - From Freud to Erikson to Marcia: Concept Maps in Personality Psychology Courses
AN  - 620955174; 2005-13307-016
AB  - This study examined concept maps produced by personality psychology students as a function of different types of concept map instruction. The results indicated the number of quantitative items in the students' concept maps significantly increased from the pretest to the posttest, as would be expected over the course of an academic semester. More importantly, the type of instructions the students received at the pretest played a significant role in the number of cross links depicted in the maps at the posttest. I discuss the results in terms of the utility of instruction type when using concept maps in social science courses. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A Theoretical Note on Concepts and the Need for Cyclic Concept Maps
AN  - 620913723; 2005-11187-001
AB  - This article examines concepts and propositions from a theoretical perspective, and establishes the need for and develops an extension to Concept Maps (CMaps), called Cyclic Concept Maps (Cyclic CMaps). Cyclic CMaps are considered to be an appropriate tool for representing knowledge of functional or dynamical relationships between concepts. CMaps, on the other hand, are viewed as an appropriate tool for representing hierarchic or static knowledge. The two maps complement each other and collectively capture a larger domain of knowledge, thus forming a more effective knowledge representation tool.

T1  - Using concept maps to optimize the composition of collaborative student groups: A pilot study
AN  - 620953677; 2005-11910-010
AB  - Aim: The aim of this paper is to stimulate interest in the practical classroom application of concept mapping strategies as an approach that teachers can easily use to enhance collaborative learning. Background: Concept mapping has been developed as a tool to support meaningful learning. However, much of the research literature fails to explain how concept maps might be most gainfully employed within the classroom. As a result, concept mapping is a tool that is under-used. Methods: Students on a postgraduate teacher preparation programme for nurses were arranged in triads on the basis of the morphology of individually-produced concept maps for the topics of 'genetics' and 'pathogenic microbes'. They were arranged in heterogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'pathogenic microbes', and then in homogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'genetics'. The number of acceptable propositions found in their individual maps was compared with the number found in the consensus group maps, and gain scores were calculated for each participant. Findings: Participants arranged in triads of individuals having very different knowledge structures were found to make a greater improvement than those arranged in triads composed of individuals with qualitatively similar knowledge structures. Conclusions: The study was undertaken with a very small sample and only looked at two topic areas. However, the findings support the idea that collaborative groups work most effectively when individuals within the group bring different perspectives to a problem, and that this perspective can be usefully identified within the classroom environment as variations in concept map morphology.

T1  - Effect of conceptual change approach accompanied with concept mapping on understanding of solution concepts
AN  - 620808034; 2005-06322-002
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping instruction, compared to traditional instruction (TI), on 8th grade students' understanding of solution concepts and their attitudes toward science as a school subject. Solution Concept Test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administered to a total of 64 eighth grade students from two classes of a general science course, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group received the conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping in a lecture by the teacher. This instruction explicitly dealt with students' misconceptions. It was designed to suggest conditions in which misconceptions could be replaced by scientific conceptions and new conceptions could be integrated with existing conceptions. The control group received TI in which the teacher provided instruction through lecture and discussion methods. The results showed that conceptual change text accompanied with concept mapping instruction caused a significantly better acquisition of scientific conceptions related to solution concept and produced significantly higher positive attitudes toward science as a school subject than the TI. In addition, logical thinking ability and prior learning were strong predictors for the concept learning related to solution. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The associations of autonomy support and conceptual press with engaged reading and conceptual learning from text
AN  - 621053288; 2005-99009-054
AB  - This study examined the associations of autonomy support and conceptual press, with reading engagement and conceptual learning from text. When students perceive their teacher to be supporting autonomy, it means that student choice, ownership, and personal goals are emphasized. When students perceive their teacher to be supporting conceptual press, it means that the teacher (a) promotes understanding of the substantial principles of a domain; (b) helps students use information integration strategies during reading, such as concept mapping, and (c) promotes persistence on moderately challenging tasks. Based on the self-process model of motivation (Connell & Wellborn, 1990) and an engagement perspective of reading (Baker, Dreher & Guthrie, 2000), it was hypothesized that as students perceived their instruction to be motivating, their reading engagement would increase. In turn, as engaged reading increases, conceptual learning from text would increase. For this investigation, 244 fourth- and fifth-grade students reported their perceptions of their teachers' use of conceptual press and autonomy support in reading instruction. Multifaceted components of reading engagement were measured. Reading engagement was defined as the manifestations of affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes during reading. In addition, participants completed a reading performance assessment in the domain of science designed to measure prior knowledge, strategic reading, and conceptual learning from text. Structural equation modeling was used to compare alternative theoretical models depicting the relations among motivated reading instruction, engaged reading, and conceptual learning from text. The direct effects model had a direct path connecting motivating reading instruction with conceptual learning from text whereas the hypothesized indirect effects model contained an indirect path from motivating reading instruction to conceptual learning from text via engaged reading. Results confirmed the hypothesis that the model including an indirect effect of motivating reading instruction on conceptual learning from text through engaged reading explained the data more fully than a direct effect model. This is consistent with the self-process model of motivation (Connell & Wellborn, 1990). These results have implications for theories of the role of social contexts in engagement and achievement, particularly in the domain of reading, and also suggest ways by which teachers might foster reading engagement among students.

T1  - Comparing several human and computer-based methods for scoring concept maps and essays
AN  - 620914340; 2005-11432-002
AB  - This article reports the results of an investigation of the convergent criterion-related validity of two computer-based tools for scoring concept maps and essays as part of the ongoing formative evaluation of these tools. In pairs, participants researched a science topic online and created a concept map of the topic. Later, participants individually wrote a short essay from their concept map. The concept maps and essays were scored by the computer-based tools and by human raters using rubrics. Computer-based concept map scores were a very good measure of the qualitative aspects of the concept maps (r = 0.84) and were an adequate measure of the quantitative aspects (r = 0.65). Also, the computer-based essay scores were an adequate measure of essay content (r = 0.71). If computer-based approaches for scoring concept maps and essays can provide a valid, low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' content knowledge, then these approaches will likely gain rapid acceptance by teachers at all levels.

T1  - Stress among allogeneic bone marrow transplantation patients
AN  - 620636984; 2005-00410-009
AB  - BMT (bone marrow transplantation) is acknowledged as one of the most stressful treatments in modern cancer care. When investigating the impact of BMT on patients it is crucial that the analytic method employed captures direct patient perceptions, allowing the patient to define the domains under investigation. In this study, a multivariate analytic method, concept mapping (CM), was used to identify perceived stressors among 109 allogeneic BMT recipients. CM employs multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses to empirically identify the structure underlying the investigated conceptual domain. The analyses of the BMT stress data resulted in an eight-cluster solution. The stress clusters, ranked from the most severe to the least severe, were identified as: Change of life and impact of long-lasting treatment; Side-effects; Distress related to treatment outcome and physiological status; Family-related stress; Fear of death and depressive thoughts; Other concerns; Negative social support; and Stress related to lack of information and the medical staff. A number of stressors generated by the patients were quite novel, and identified important information likely to be useful in clinical settings as well as subsequent research with this high-risk population.

T1  - A Collaborative Approach to Nutrition Education for College Students
AN  - 620520569; 2004-19187-003
AB  - It is well established in the literature that college students have poor eating habits and that many barriers exist to achieving optimal nutrition for this busy population. Little is known about students' perceptions of this problem or suggestions for improving their dietary habits. Similarly, college health professionals need innovative approaches to nutritional education. In an effort to develop an online nutrition resource specifically geared to college students, the authors assessed the availability of Internet-based nutritional information for this population and conducted focus groups with students and health professionals to identify relevant nutrition concerns. They used concept-mapping techniques to conduct a systematic analysis of the qualitative information generated from their focus group participants. Their findings emphasize the need for targeted resources for college students and the importance of using students' suggestions in developing nutrition programs.

T1  - Using Concept Mapping for Assessing and Promoting Relational Conceptual Change in Science
AN  - 620384298; 2004-13816-004
AB  - In this article, we adopted the relational conceptual change as our theoretical framework to accommodate current views of conceptual change such as ontological beliefs, epistemological commitment, and social/affective contexts commonly mentioned in the literature. We used a specific concept mapping format and process--digraphs and digraphing--as an operational framework for assessing and promoting relational conceptual change. We wanted to find out how concept mapping can be used to account for relational conceptual change. We collected data from a Grade 12 chemistry class using collaborative computerized concept mapping on an ongoing basis during a unit of instruction. Analysis of progressive concept maps and interview transcripts of representative students and the teacher showed that ongoing and collaborative computerized concept mapping is able to account for student conceptual change in ontological, epistemological, and social/affective domains.

T1  - The interaction of reading skills and science content knowledge when teaching struggling secondary students
AN  - 620333180; 2004-11689-007
AB  - Science content area texts are difficult for most middle school students, particularly whose reading skills are below grade level. This article describes an innovative approach to integrating the teaching of middle school science content and reading skills to increase levels of student success with content area textbooks. For reading instruction, this approach features carefully selected vocabulary, word reading instruction, oral (including partner reading) and silent reading with reading fluency practice as needed, and explicit instruction on comprehension strategies, such as retelling, concept mapping, and summarization. The teaching of the science content incorporates instructional design principles that have been documented to improve comprehension of science content, process skills, and higher order thinking. Six aspects of instructional design that are discussed are the identification and teaching of big ideas, the systematic instruction of vocabulary (including science affixes), a review and integration of core concepts, visual displays of how core concepts are integrated, mnemonics for core concepts, and structured hands-on activities.

T1  - Evaluation of nutritional education using concept mapping
AN  - 620521842; 2004-18616-008
AB  - The concept mapping method is presented in the current study as a new tool to assess the learning process taking part in the hallmark of a nutritional education program addressed to obese diabetic patients. Population: eight patients were interviewed prior to and after completion of 1-week in-hospital stay during which concept maps were designed. Concept maps quantitative and qualitative analysis disclose both (i) the importance of previous knowledge among patients prior to nutritional education and (ii) the maintenance of misconceptions after it. Nutritional education allows patients to acquire and structure their knowledge while providing them with a certain amount of medical vocabulary. An underlying correlation between concept maps design and the results of psychological tests identifying eating behaviour troubles (EBT), depression or anxiety has not been clearly identified. However, the nutritional education is more beneficial to those patients with a higher degree of self-assertiveness and with a lesser degree of anxiety, depression and eating disorder.

AB  - This study compared the use of paper/pencil and computer tools for creating concept maps. Participants were 52 students in two combined 9th/10th grade biology classes. An independent measures research design was used. There were two treatment groups: computer and paper/pencil. The computer group created concept maps using 
Inspiration software on desktop computers. The paper/pencil group made concept maps in the traditional manner. The t statistic was used to evaluate the mean difference between the two treatments. The group using the computer created more complex maps than the group that used paper/pencil. This difference was significant. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using simulation diagrams to facilitate reasoning about mechanisms and systems
AN  - 620635932; 2004-99020-083
AB  - This study attempts to investigate the effectiveness of simulation diagrams, an instructional tool intended to facilitate reasoning about mechanisms and systems. In particular, the focus is on whether simulation diagrams can promote the construction of mental models of mechanisms and systems by making their underlying structures and processes transparent, and by conveying the functional relations among entities explicitly. Experiment 1 compares participants in the simulation diagram condition to participants in the summary condition. It was found that participants who were trained in simulation diagrams and who constructed simulation diagrams improved on systems thinking, whereas participants who were trained in summary writing and who wrote summaries did not. Experiment 2 compares participants in the simulation diagram condition to participants in the concept map condition. It was found that participants who received training in either concept maps or simulation diagrams and who constructed either concept maps or simulation diagrams improved on systems thinking. However, participants in the simulation diagram condition improved more than participants in the concept map condition. This was due to more thinking about functional relations by the simulation diagram group. Additional findings from both experiments further support the claim that simulation diagrams may help develop students' understanding of functional relations and thereby promote the construction of mental models of mechanisms and systems.

T1  - How do students navigate and learn from nonlinear science texts: Can metanavigation support promote science learning?
AN  - 620621741; 2004-99013-045
AB  - Digital texts which are based on hypertext and hypermedia technologies are now being used to support science learning. Hypertext offers certain opportunities for learning as well as difficulties that challenge readers to become metacognitively aware of their navigation decisions in order to trade both meaning and structure while reading. The goal of this study was to investigate whether supporting sixth grade students to monitor and regulate their navigation behavior while reading from hypertext would lead to better navigation and learning. Metanavigation support in the form of prompts was provided to groups of students who used a hypertext system called CoMPASS to complete a design challenge. The metanavigation prompts aimed at encouraging students to understand the affordances of the navigational aids in CoMPASS and use them to guide their navigation. The study was conducted in a real classroom setting during the implementation of CoMPASS in sixth grade science classes. Multiple sources of group and individual data were collected and analyzed. Measures included student's individual performance in a pre-science knowledge test, the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI), a reading comprehension test and a concept map test. Process measures included log file information that captured group navigation paths during the use of CoMPASS. The results suggested that providing metanavigation support enabled the groups to make coherent transitions among the text units. Findings also revealed that reading comprehension, presence of metanavigation support and prior domain knowledge significantly predicted students' individual understanding of science. Implications for hypertext design and literacy research fields are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Editorial - Theory Testing Research versus Theory-Based Research
AN  - 620497039; 2004-17852-001
AB  - What is the role of theory in educational research? The editor was using theory as a basis for deciding on what variables to look at. But a critical difference was that in the natural sciences, and psychology, there is an interplay between theory and experiment - theory informs you of critical experiments, and findings from experiments permits modification, acceptance or rejection of theory. McGaghie's paper on concept mapping in the present issue shows that by getting experts to rate similarity among concepts, one can generate concept maps which purport to represent the mental organization of knowledge. But as Schmidt points out in the Reflections in this issue, while the data are consistent with concept maps as a mental representation, they cannot be used to conclude that concept maps are 
the mental representation of experts. The essence of science is to identify regularities in nature so that we can predict how future events, observed under particular circumstances, will unfold. Theories are essential in our quest to understand and predict phenomena. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using Concept Mapping to Aid African American Students' Understanding in Middle Grade Science
AN  - 620194650; 2003-09540-004
AB  - This article reports on the results of a nine-week investigation that examined the effectiveness of concept mapping on science achievement of 182 African American middle grade science students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes (by ability levels). Ability level was examined as a covariate on student achievement. For this sample of students, analyses of covariance indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that concept mapping has a positive effect on average (lower) ability level African American science students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Remediating High School Students' Misconceptions Concerning Diffusion and Osmosis through Concept Mapping and Conceptual Change Text
AN  - 620131452; 2003-06769-001
AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of combining conceptual change text and concept mapping strategy on students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis. Students' conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis was measured using the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test developed by Odom and Barrow. The test was administered as pretest and post-test to a total of 44 ninth-grade students in two intact classes of the same high school located in an urban area. The experimental group was a class of 24 students who received concept mapping and conceptual change text instruction. A class of 20 students comprised the control group who received a traditional instruction. Group Assessment of Logical Thinking Test and pretest scores were used as covariates in this study. A pretest-post-test control group design utilising the analysis of covariance showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the favour of the experimental group after treatment. While the average percentage of students in the experimental group holding a scientifically correct view had risen from 22.5% to 54.1%, a gain of 31.6%, the percentage of correct responses of the students in the control group had increased from 19.1% to 38.7%, a gain of 19.6% after treatment.

T1  - Theoretical Perspectives on Learning in an Informal Setting
AN  - 620072360; 2003-04700-003
AB  - Research into learning in informal settings such as museums has been in a formative state during the past decade, and much of that research has been descriptive and lacking a theory base. In this article, it is proposed that the human constructivist view of learning can guide research and assist the interpretation of research data because it recognizes an individual's prior knowledge and active involvement in knowledge construction during a museum visit. This proposal is supported by reference to the findings of a previously reported interpretive case study, which included concept mapping and semistructured interviews, of the knowledge transformations of three Year 7 students who had participated in a class visit to a science museum and associated postvisit activities. The findings from that study are shown in this report to be consistent with the human constructivist view of learning in that for all three students, learning was found to be at times incremental and at other times to involve substantial restructuring of knowledge. Thus, we regard that the human constructivist view of learning has much merit and utility for researchers investigating the development of knowledge and understanding emergent from experiences in informal settings.

T1  - Metaphor and content: An embodied paradigm for learning
AN  - 620256446; 2003-95015-045
AB  - Through a direct application of two cognitive science theories, conceptual metaphor (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999) and structure mapping (Gentner, 1983, 1989; Gentner & Markman, 1995), this project defined an instructional design model for the design, development, and assessment of metaphor-enhanced, computer-mediated learning environments. It used the model to produce an instructional product with a metaphor-based interface. The project also built a parallel learning environment that employed a concept map interface. To test the metaphor-based product's effectiveness at enabling learners to build rich mental models of (55 female, 2 male; mean age of 21) through the instruction, randomly assigning half to the concept map interface environment and half to the metaphor-based interface environment. Participants completed four essay-type assessment questions. Trained raters, blind to participant assignment, isolated any of the 13 targeted concepts present within participants' protocols and, through consensus, constructed a concept map for each participant, representing that participant's mental model of the targeted domain. Map attributes were translated into four weighted subscores (nodes, branches, levels, and cross-links) and summed. Comparison across the two groups indicated no significant difference for richness of mental model, t(55) = -.72, p > .05, although the discussion suggests methods for increasing the power in subsequent experimental sessions. A significant interaction between Subscore and Achievement, F(3, 51) = 3142, p < .01, suggests that concept map crosslinks are much more sensitive to differences in domain integration and the general richness of a participant's mental model than the level and branch subscores. This result has implications for classroom application. Concept maps have taken a place as a learner's, a teacher's, and a researcher's tool. With cross-domain validation and domain-specific extensions, specification of the relative sensitivity of various subscales, that is, the structure of the concept map, will enable educators to justify weighting scales and identify learner achievement. Credible concept map weighting scales also enhance learners' self-reliant and impartial assessment of personal growth in domain-specific knowledge. Results suggest that learners who have difficulty integrating domain concepts require direct, explicit instruction to help them to make connections between disparate conceptual strands.

T1  - The effects of collaborative concept mapping on the achievement, science self-efficacy and attitude toward science of female eighth-grade students
AN  - 620253198; 2003-95021-045
AB  - This study sought to examine whether collaborative concept mapping would affect the achievement, science self-efficacy and attitude toward science of female eighth grade science students. The research questions are: (1) Will the use of collaborative concept mapping affect the achievement of female students in science? (2) Will the use of collaborative concept mapping affect the science self-efficacy of female students? (3) Will the use of collaborative concept mapping affect the attitudes of females toward science? The study was quasi-experimental and utilized a pretest-posttest design for both experimental and control groups. Eighth grade female and male students from three schools in a large northeastern school district participated in this study. The achievement test consisted of 10 multiple choice and two open-response questions and used questions from state-wide and national assessments as well as teacher-constructed items. A 29 item Likert type instrument (McMillan, 1992) was administered to measure science self-efficacy and attitude toward science. The study was of 12 weeks duration. During the study, experimental group students were asked to perform collaborative concept map construction in single sex dyads using specific terms designated by the classroom teacher and the researcher. During classroom visitations, student perceptions of collaborative concept mapping were collected and were used to provide insight into the results of the quantitative data analysis. Data from the pre and posttest instruments were analyzed for both experimental and control groups using t-tests. Additionally, the three teachers were interviewed and their perceptions of the study were also used to gain insight into the results of the study. The analysis of data showed that experimental group females showed significantly higher gains in achievement than control group females. An additional analysis of data showed experimental group males showed significantly greater gains in achievement than experimental group females. The analysis of science self-efficacy data showed that neither experimental nor control group females increased their scores pre to posttest, both showed small decreases in scores. However, the posttest scores of the experimental group females were significantly higher than the posttest scores of the control group females. The analysis of the attitude toward science survey data showed that the scores of the experimental group females did not change from pre to posttest. However, scores of the control group females declined from pre to posttest. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - An investigation of the relationship between middle school science teachers' knowledge and beliefs regarding the coherence and connections among science concepts and their classroom practices
AN  - 620249632; 2003-95015-043
AB  - In the last three decades, the United States has experienced many science education reform initiatives resulting in mixed success. Recently, research has found teachers' beliefs about their content and teaching have influence on what is taught. This investigation attempts to learn about the relationship between middle school teachers' beliefs and knowledge regarding the coherence and connectedness of science concepts and their classroom practice. This phenomenological investigation used an inductive qualitative research approach with multiple instruments and processes including; a survey, interviews, classroom observations, concept maps and classroom materials for data. The results suggest that middle school science teachers' ability to teach science in a connected and coherent fashion may be tied to their mental schema for organizing science ideas, curriculum materials, and their reflections on what they are teaching and why. Further research should help isolate and mitigate outside influences leading to a better understanding of teachers' beliefs about science.

T1  - Identifying Critical Junctures in Learning in a College Course on Evolution
AN  - 620015172; 2003-02464-010
AB  - The purpose of this research study was to (a) describe how concept mapping can be used as an integral instructional strategy for teaching a college course on evolution, (b) evaluate the utility of incorporating concept mapping in a college course on evolution, (c) determine whether students' concept maps reveal "critical junctures" in learning as the course unfolds, and (d) assess the impact of concept mapping on students' study practices and on students' understanding of course content. Key findings include: (a) Critical junctures in learning evolution can be identified by monitoring the degree of concordance of superordinate concepts appearing on the class set of concept maps submitted after each of the course lectures; (b) students who made concept maps reported spending an average of 37% more study time on this college biology course than on their previous biology courses; and (c) the use of "seed concepts," "micromapping," a standard concept map format, and a standard concept map checklist made the strategy feasible for the instructor to implement and for the student to adopt. A concept map performance index formulas was also developed for this research study in order to assess students' overall mapping performance.

T1  - Effects of partner's ability on the achievement and conceptual organization of high-achieving fifth-grade students
AN  - 619859552; 2002-11643-004
AB  - This study investigated high-achieving fifth-grade students' achievement gains and conceptual reorganization during a unit on convection. Specifically, the achievement and cognitive gains that occurred as a result of interactions of high-achieving students with a high-achieving or low-achieving laboratory partner were compared. The study design included an instructional sequence of three dyadic inquiry investigations related to convection currents as well as pre- and postassessments consisting of a multiple-choice test, card sorting task, construction of a concept map, and an interview. Results showed no significant differences for achievement of high-achieving students regardless of the partner's achievement level and only slight differences in conceptual reorganization. The implications of this study for heterogeneous grouping and construction of knowledge by dyads is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Effects of the level of generativity in concept mapping with knowledge of correct response feedback on learning
AN  - 619964515; 2002-95021-010
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of blending both feedback and concept map generation on learning terminology and learner comprehension. The overall effect of each treatment was measured by individual scores on the total criterion test, the terminology test, and the comprehension test. This study also investigated those instances in which there was a significant difference between test scores of learner generated concept map items versus those that were matched to researcher generated concept map items by students who used partially generated concept maps with feedback and those without feedback. The sample population of the study included 150 freshmen students at a large northeastern university. There was a mix of male (n = 79) and female (n = 71) students, in both science (n = 55) and non-science (n = 95) majors. The findings in this study indicated that: (a) the use of concept mapping was not significantly different from those who did not use concept mapping on the criterion test scores; (b) those who did not receive feedback (totally generated and partially generated maps) did significantly better than those with feedback on the comprehension test score; (c) those working with the partially generated maps with feedback did significantly better on the terminology test score items that matched on the learner generated items versus those that matched the researcher generated ones; and (d) there were significant differences between science and non-science majors, with science majors doing significantly better on the terminology test.

T1  - Meaningful learning: The essential factor for conceptual change in limited or inappropriate propositional hierarchies leading to empowerment of learners
AN  - 619904501; 2002-15334-003
AB  - States that the construction and reconstruction of meanings by learners requires that they actively seek to integrate new knowledge with knowledge already in their cognitive structure. "Situated learning" occurs when learning is by rote or at a lower level of meaningful learning. Concept mapping has been used effectively to aid meaningful learning with resulting modification of student's knowledge structures. When these knowledge structures are limited or faulty in some way, they may be referred to as Limited or Inappropriate Propositional Hierarchies (LIPH's). Conceptual change, or more accurately conceptual reconstruction, requires meaningful teaming to modify LIPH's. Collaborative group learning facilitates meaningful learning and new knowledge construction. World-wide economic changes are forcing changes in business and industry placing a premium on the power and value or knowledge and new knowledge production. These changes require changes in school and university education that centers on the nature and power of meaningful learning. Computer tools are available to facilitate teaching activities targeted at modifying LIPH's and aiding meaningful learning in general. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A science teacher's reflections and knowledge growth about STS instruction after actual implementation
AN  - 619821143; 2002-10386-002
AB  - The major purpose of this study was to describe a science teacher's views of STS (Science-Technology-Society) instruction and what she acquired after implementing a 2-semester STS-oriented science course in a high school of Taiwan. The teacher's journals, interview data, concept maps, and relevant student questionnaire responses were analyzed. The teacher believed that STS instruction was a potential way of practicing so-called "constructivist" teaching and her pedagogical knowledge about STS showed a considerable growth. As a result of STS instruction, her epistemological views of science seemed to progress toward more constructivist-oriented views of science. The heavy content load of Taiwan's national curriculum, regular cross-class standard tests, the lack of peers' or administrative support, the resource limitations in Chinese language, and the cultural impacts were identified as major factors that inhibited her implementation of STS instruction.

T1  - Integrating concept mapping and the learning cycle to teach diffusion and osmosis concepts to high school biology students
AN  - 619636776; 2001-09066-001
AB  - Explored the effectiveness of concept mapping, the learning cycle, expository instruction, and a combination of concept mapping/learning cycle in promoting conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis. Four high school biology classes were taught diffusion and osmosis concepts with the aforementioned treatments. Conceptual understanding was assessed immediately and seven weeks after instruction with the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test. 108 secondary students (grades 10–11) participated in the study. The results indicated the concept mapping/learning cycle and concept mapping treatment groups significantly outperformed the expository treatment group in conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis. There was no significant difference among the learning cycle group and other treatments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Investigating the quality of student discourse: What constitutes a productive student discourse?
AN  - 619922267; 2002-17376-005
AB  - In this article the authors present an analytic framework that they used to study the quality of student discourse in collaborative learning tasks that focus on deepening conceptual understanding. The authors illustrate this framework with an example of two 15-yr old boys who collaborated on a concept mapping task about electricity. Inspired by socio-constructivist and sociocultural perspectives on science learning and instruction, the authors focus on the amount and type of discourse about concepts, the amount and type of elaboration, the amount and type of co-construction and on the use of available tools. Results show how these dimensions shape the conditions for deepening students' understanding of concepts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - On the validity of cognitive interpretations of scores from alternative concept-mapping techniques
AN  - 619642273; 2001-11485-002
AB  - Provides a framework for examining cognitive validity claims that includes conceptual and empirical analyses and uses it to evaluate the validity of a connected understanding interpretation of 3 concept-mapping (CM) techniques: (1) construct-a-map from scratch; (2) fill-in-the-nodes; and (3) fill-in-the-lines. The 1st technique imposes little structure on students (low-directedness), whereas the other 2 techniques are more structured (high-directedness). The framework focuses on analysis of the CM tasks' intended demands, and the tasks' correspondence with inferred cognitive activities (ICAs) and performance scores. To infer cognitive activities, the authors examined concurrent and retrospective verbalizations of teachers and expert and novice high school chemistry students in performing the CM tasks and compared the directedness of the CM tasks, the characteristics of verbalization, and the scores obtained across techniques. The framework allowed the authors to determine that (a) the 3 CM techniques provided different pictures of students' knowledge, and (b) ICAs across CM techniques differed in relation to task directedness. The low-directed technique provided students with more opportunities to reveal their conceptual understanding than did the high-directed techniques.

T1  - The differential effects of prior knowledge on learning: A study of two consecutive courses in earth sciences
AN  - 619614155; 2001-06549-001
AB  - Studied the relationship between learning in a university 1st-yr Introduction to Geomorphology course, prior knowledge from a prerequisite course, and prior knowledge in the earth science subjects. 10 dimensions of knowledge were tapped before and after the course by conventional (achievement) and cognitive structure measures derived from concept mapping. Analysis of learning outcomes yielded these results for 13 students: (1) students acquired only a small portion of the content in the course, (2) prior geological and geomorphological knowledge did not affect learning new content, (3) minor effects appeared within rather than across knowledge dimensions and affected mainly learning of smaller knowledge units, and (4) concept definition was not a valid probe of knowledge. The differential effects of prior knowledge are seen to question the central role that schema theories ascribe to prior knowledge in future learning. It is concluded that the results suggest additional factors to be considered in the sequencing of courses, the acquisition of complex knowledge with partial meaning of the basic knowledge units, and the use of new cognitive structure probes of knowledge.

T1  - Students' use of web-based concept map testing and strategies for learning
AN  - 619568924; 2001-00124-002
AB  - Develops and evaluates a web-based concept map testing system for science students. Ss were 38 Taiwanese 17-yr-old high school students. Authors found that the students' performance on the system was not significantly related to their achievement as measured by traditional standard tests. Their views about the use of the system, in general, were positive. An analysis of students' future use of the system and their motivation and learning strategies reveals that those with more critical thinking metacognitive activities and an effort regulation management strategy showed more willingness to use the online testing system. Moreover, students with high test anxiety also showed a preference to be tested through the system. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Comparison of the reliability and validity of scores from two concept-mapping techniques
AN  - 619679566; 2001-16695-005
AB  - Reports the results of a study that compared 2 concept-mapping techniques, 1 high-directed, "fill-in-the-map," and 1 low-directed, "construct-a-map-from-scratch." The researchers examined whether: (1) skeleton map scores were sensitive to the sample of nodes or linking lines to be filled in; (2) the 2 types of skeleton maps were equivalent; and (3) the 2 mapping techniques provided similar information about high school chemistry students' connected understanding. Results indicated that fill-in-the-map scores were not sensitive to the sample of concepts or linking lines to be filled in. Nevertheless, the fill-in-the-nodes and fill-in-the-lines techniques were not equivalent forms of fill-in-the-map. Finally, high-directed and low-directed maps led to different interpretations about students' knowledge structure. Whereas scores obtained under the high-directed technique indicated that students' performance was close to the maximum possible, the scores obtained with the low-directed technique revealed that students' knowledge was incomplete compared to a criterion map. It is concluded that the construct-a-map technique better reflected differences among students' knowledge structure. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Select-and-fill-in concept map scores as a measure of students' connected understanding of science
AN  - 619654219; 2001-14116-009
AB  - Developed and explored the validity of a select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map as a measure of students' connected understanding of science (CUS) in 2 studies. Study 1 explored the use of SAFI with 635 middle school students (MSSs). Study 2 continued this work with 129 university students (USs). In both cases maps were integral parts of evaluation and took place during regular classes. Study 1, specifically, addressed concerns related to the assessment format and the cognitive processes required by students to complete the SAFI assessments. Studies 1 and 2 both addressed aspects of internal consistency (IC) and the relationships of map scores to those from other measures such as multiple-choice (MC) and relatedness rating (RR) assessments. The results show that scores for both studies possessed high IC and exhibited large mean increases with increased domain exposure. Further, SAFI scores are strongly related to scores from standardized MC achievement measures for MSSs where work with individual students suggests that Ss used strategies requiring connected understanding to successfully complete the maps. SAFI scores form USs are found to exhibit large relationships with scores from direct-instruction MC and RR exams. These findings support the SAFI format as a measure of CUS.

T1  - Concept mapping effects on science content comprehension of low-achieving inner-city seventh graders
AN  - 619551548; 2000-16760-004
AB  - Compared the use of a concept-mapping procedure with low-achieving, inner-city students (average age of 12.2 yrs). 124 seventh-grade students from an urban parochial school were randomly assigned to 2 equally sized groups. One group was taught by a read-and-discuss, teacher-directed method, and the second group, given the same type of introductory lesson as the first, followed a model of concept mapping that connected major and minor concept ideas. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a science chapter served as the dependent variable. Prior to any teaching, a pretest was administered. Results showed a statistically significant difference in comprehension between the pretest and posttest for the experimental group. Effect size estimates revealed that concept mapping can improve comprehension scores of low-achieving seventh graders over a traditional instructional technique. When students lack background information on a topic to aid comprehension, the active participation in constructing semantic or concept maps may help students form a cognitive schema to assimilate and relate the new topic information.

T1  - Tools for integrating women's health into medical education: Clinical cases and concept mapping
AN  - 619538664; 2000-16518-002
AB  - Describes 2 teaching tools, case-based learning and concept mapping, and how they support cross-disciplinary, multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary learning; use a biopsychosocial model; and promote the integration of sex- and gender-based science into the medical curriculum. The process of case development at MCP Hahnemann University is outlined in detail for a specific case. The case, which integrates 3 different components of women's health, is presented in full. The authors then provide an example of a concept map dealing with women and alcohol use; the map defines current knowledge and serves as a blueprint for developing curricular goals and teaming objectives for the topic. It is noted that properly constructed concept maps and cases help teach patient-centered approaches to problem solving, address sex- and gender-based differences in disease as well as in pathophysiology and pharmacology, integrate psychosocial issues—such as family dynamics, environmental stressors, access to health care, effective gender-based communication between patient and provider, and cultural variations—along with biomedical ones, and encourage a multidisciplinary approach to patient care.

T1  - Does individual tutoring produce optimal learning?
AN  - 619946887; 2002-18035-007
AB  - Compared the effectiveness of individual tutoring and group instruction. 100 5th-6th grade students completed a 4-wk environmental science module as part of a teacher-student dyad, student-student dyad, a member of a same-age peer group with teacher, or a member of a same-age peer group without a teacher. Subjects' (Ss') learning was assessed following completion of the module by the construction of concept maps and the composition of essays concerning environmental science. Results show that Ss who worked in large, same-age cooperative groups without a teacher demonstrated their conceptual understanding of the topic as well as did those Ss who were tutored by a teacher. All Ss demonstrated significant improvements in their understanding of environmental science: those Ss in child-child dyads performed more poorly than all other Ss.

T1  - The use of textbooks as a tool during collaborative physics learning
AN  - 619666227; 2001-16245-004
AB  - The study examined how features of student interaction, and the way an individual student contributes to that interaction (his or her participation), relates to the improvement of conceptual understanding within the domain of physics. The study also investigated how textbooks are used during collaborative work and how that use affects the quality of student interaction and outcomes. The participants were 56 students aged 15 or 16. The students worked in dyads on a concept-mapping task that functioned as an introduction for a new course about electricity. A condition in which the students were provided with 2 textbooks was compared with a condition without the availability of textbooks. The use of textbooks had a negative influence on the amount of elaboration and coconstruction in the student interaction. Individual learning outcomes were positively related to the amount of collaborative elaboration in the student interaction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Development of knowledge about electricity and magnetism during a visit to a science museum and related post-visit activities
AN  - 619469647; 2000-05546-006
AB  - Reports on part of a larger study of how 11- and 12-yr-old students construct knowledge about electricity and magnetism by drawing on aspects of their experiences during the course of a school visit to an interactive science museum and subsequent classroom activities linked to the museum exhibits. This study focuses on the influence of post-visit activities on learning and knowledge construction in 2 students. A descriptive interpretive approach was used, with principal data sources comprising student-generated concept maps and semistructured interviews at 3 stages of the study. The findings provide evidence that the integrated series of post-visit activities resulted in students constructing and reconstructing their personal knowledge of science concepts and principles represented in the science museum exhibits. Also, the results demonstrate the interrelationships between learning that occurs at school, home, and in informal learning settings. The authors note the importance for classroom teachers and science museum staff of planning pre- and post-visit activities and conclude that this not only supports the development of scientific conceptions, but also helps to detect and respond to alternative conceptions that may be produced or strengthened.

T1  - The effect of talk and writing on learning science: An exploratory study
AN  - 619469607; 2000-05546-002
AB  - Investigated the role of talk and writing on learning science in 43 8th graders (27 boys and 16 girls) randomly assigned to 3 treatment groups (a writing-only treatment group, a talk-only treatment group, and a combined talk and writing treatment group) and a control group. A mixed factorial design (4 × 2 × 2), with a pretest and 2 posttests (immediate and delayed), was employed to test the effects of gender and treatment on dependent measures which were based on data from multiple-choice tests, essay questions, and concept maps. Records of student talk and writing were analyzed to describe the mechanisms involved. The findings suggest that talk is important for sharing, clarifying, and distributing knowledge among peers, while asking questions, hypothesizing, explaining, and formulating ideas together are all important mechanisms during peer discussions. Analytical writing is an important tool for transforming rudimentary ideas into knowledge that is more coherent and structured. Also, talk combined with writing seemed to enhance the retention of science learning over time. It is suggested that gender and ability may be important mediating variables that determine the effectiveness of talk and writing for enhancing learning.

T1  - Collaborative learning tasks and the elaboration of conceptual knowledge
AN  - 619455673; 2000-02272-002
AB  - Presents the results of an experimental study of the influence of collaborative task characteristics on the characteristics of elaboration of conceptual knowledge in student social interaction. With a pre-test and post-test we measured individual learning outcomes. We constructed a coding scheme that focuses on the communicative functions and propositional content of utterances and on elaborative episodes. The subjects were 40 students (mean age 16 yrs old) who worked in dyads on a collaborative task about electricity in one of four conditions. We compared a concept mapping task with a poster task and investigated the effect of a phase of individual preparation. The post-test scores were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. Individual preparation created better learning results and the asking of more questions. The concept mapping conditions showed more discussion of electricity concepts, collaboratively elaborated conflicts and reasoning, but no higher individual learning outcomes. In the concept mapping conditions, elaboration was related to individual learning outcomes. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The religion-in-the-science-classroom issue: Seeking graduate student conceptual change
AN  - 619492138; 2000-08507-002
AB  - Examines the extent to which 9 science education graduate students enjoy a well-articulated position on the compatibility of science and religion and are comfortable with their views and plans for the role of religion in science classroom discussions. The authors focused on examining changes in student mental states as a legitimate form of conceptual change after a course intervention. The intervention asked students to write a "talk back to the author" paper shortly after reading a provocative essay on the topic. Then the students read and discussed a variety of alternative views after which Ss wrote 4 more formal position papers on the science-religion topic. A content analysis was conducted on both papers, developing separate concept maps of the overall class response in the 1st and 2nd papers, noting changes in emphases. A individual evaluation form was developed based on categories that emerged in the class analysis. These included ontological, epistemological, and social/affective dimensions of conceptual change. The conceptual change for each student from talk-back to position paper was subsequently reported using individual graphs and citing text examples. Results showed conceptual change or improved mental state in all three categories for most students. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - How a qualitative approach to concept map analysis can be used to aid learning by illustrating patterns of conceptual development
AN  - 619526236; 2000-13940-003
AB  - This paper describes a qualitative approach to analyzing students' concept maps. The classification highlights 3 major patterns which are referred to as "spoke', "chain' and "net' structures. Examples are given from Year 8 science classes. The patterns are interpreted as being indicators of progressive levels of understanding. It is proposed that identification of these differences may help the classroom teacher to focus teaching for more effective learning and may be used as a basis for structuring groups in collaborative settings. This approach to analyzing concept maps is of value because it suggests teaching approaches that help students integrate new knowledge and build upon their existing naive concepts. The authors also refer to the teacher's scheme of work and to the National Curriculum for science in order to consider their influence in the construction of understanding. Further work is in progress to better understand how students with different conceptual structures can be most appropriately helped to achieve learning development.

T1  - The impact of Korean language accommodations on concept mapping tasks for Korean American English language learners
AN  - 619551120; 2000-95003-169
AB  - As the U.S. population becomes increasingly multicultural, there is growing need in assessment for the valid accommodation of English Language Learner (ELL) students. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities and differences in performance of Korean American sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade ELL students taking an English version of a concept mapping task (showing relationships graphically) in environmental science with either no language accommodation or with accommodation through translations and aid in making propositions (which took into account the Korean proposition word order of subject-object-verb). The study was conducted in two parts (a) ELL and non-ELL students taking concept mapping tasks using paper and stickers (the Stickers Accommodation Study) and (b) only ELL students taking both a computer version of the concept mapping task and the stickers version (the Repeated Measures Study). For the Stickers Accommodation Study, results did not show significant differences between accommodated and non-accommodated groups. Background variables like prior knowledge, length of time in U.S., and English academic language proficiencies did predict concept mapping performance of the Stickers Accommodations Study students as a whole. The various outcome measures were analyzed as a latent variable using confirmatory factor analysis with background variable covariates, or MIMIC modeling. Prior knowledge was the only variable found to be significant predictors of the factor, as measured by concept mapping, concept map summary and explanation task performance for both ESL and non-ESL participants in the Stickers Accommodation Study. The same result was found for the ESL students only. In the Repeated Measures Study, differences were examined between performance on a Korean-only and an English-with-Korean-translation version of a computer concept mapping task. There was a significant difference for the Repeated Measures Study students in favor of students taking the English-with-Korean-translation version. A MIMIC model was also run for the Repeated Measures Study and additional background variables like academic language proficiencies in both English and Korean and prior formal schooling were found to be significant predictors. A discussion of the findings and implications for future research are presented. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Exploring the development of conceptual ecologies: Communities of concepts related to convection and heat
AN  - 619510515; 2000-13577-002
AB  - Examined the relationships and development of communities of concepts related to heat and convection among 61 5th-grade students who worked with a partner for a series of heat and convection laboratory investigations. Students' knowledge was assessed before and after instruction through the use of a written test, concept maps, card sort tasks, and interviews. During instruction each dyad was audiorecorded and observed by a field researcher. The types of knowledge elicited by each type of assessment were identified. Findings include the influence of familial and cultural experiences on conceptual development, as well as the extent to which competing phenomena (evaporation and dissolving) have on the development of new conceptual understandings. The study also found that each assessment measure elicited different types of knowledge. Concept maps were effective in describing students' existing schemas related to heat prior to instruction. Multidimensional scaling and the card sorting task provided information on students' conceptual organization for clusters of concepts. The interviews and dyad discourse transcripts were most effective in revealing the processes and prior knowledge that students used as they interpreted new observations in light of preexisting experiences.

T1  - Learner factors associated with radical conceptual change among undergraduates
AN  - 619443797; 1999-95023-090
AB  - Students frequently enter learning situations with knowledge inconsistent with scientific views. One goal of science instruction is to enable students to construct scientifically accepted ideas while rejecting inaccurate constructs. This process is called conceptual change. This study examined factors associated with students at three levels of conceptual change to elucidate possible influences on the conceptual change process. Factors studied included motivation (including utility value, interest, attainment value, mood, self efficacy, and task difficulty), prior experiences with science, perceptions of the nature of science, connections to objects or events outside the classroom, and specific activities that helped students learn. Four science classes for undergraduate preservice elementary teachers participated in the study, conducted during a three week unit on electricity. Data sources included concept maps, drawings, reflective journal entries, quizzes, a science autobiography assignment, and interviews. Concept maps, drawings, and quizzes were analyzed, and students were placed into high, moderate, and low conceptual change groups. Of the ninety-eight students in the study, fifty-seven were interviewed. Perhaps the most important finding of this study relates to the assessment of conceptual change. Interviews were conducted two months after the unit, and many items on the concept maps had decayed from students' memories. This indicates that time is an important factor. In addition, interview-derived data demonstrated conceptual change levels; concept maps were insufficient to indicate the depth of students' understanding. Factors associated with conceptual change include self efficacy and interest in topic. In addition, moderate conceptual change students cited specific activities as having helped them learn. Low and high students focused on the method of instruction rather than specific activities. Factors not found to be associated with conceptual change include: utility value, mood, task difficulty, and prior experiences with science, and connections to objects and events outside the classroom. Attainment value, perceptions of the nature of science, and mood cannot be ruled out as possible factors due to the problematic nature of assessing them within the context of this study.

T1  - The effect of computer simulations and the learning cycle on students' conceptual understanding of Newton's Three Laws of Motion. (Sir Isaac Newton, concept mapping)
AN  - 619445015; 1999-95021-109
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how three different methods of instruction would affect a student's conceptual understanding of Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion. The three methods were the expository, learning cycle, and computer simulations. Three sections of students enrolled in a suburban mid-western high school's introductory physics course were the subjects of this study. The students' conceptual understanding of Newton's three laws of motion were assessed prior to and after instructional treatment with concept mapping. All concept maps were scored by the teacher and a colleague well-practiced in the use of concept maps. The inter-rater reliability coefficients ranged from 0.23 to 0.61. After instruction, a 2-tier multiple-choice instrument was used to determine if any gains had been achieved in students' conceptual understanding as well as to identify any remaining misconceptions. All gain scores in concept mapping assessment categories were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs. ANOVAs were also run on all 12 individual items on the 2-tier test as well as overall student total scores, No significant differences were found between any of the groups. The split-half reliability of the two-tier instrument was 0.59. Difficulty indices ranged from 0.12 to 0.56, and discrimination indices ranged from 0.11 to 0.61. Each item was analyzed to determine student understanding of, and identifying misconceptions about the nature of forces as they pertain to Newton's laws of motion. Analysis of concept mapping results and 2-tier items, clearly indicated that most of the students in all groups still adhere to the common misconception that motion implies that a force must be present in order to maintain an object's state of motion or conversely that no motion implies that there are no forces acting on the object.

T1  - The investigation of exploratory learning strategies using computer-based modeling tools when solving veterinarian clinical case study problems
AN  - 619444901; 1999-95021-023
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using two types of exploratory, model-based learning activities to help participants solve clinical case study problems in the content domain of veterinarian pharmacokinetics. A total of 75 veterinary medicine students used a computer modeling program called STELLA to either construct a model of a pharmacokinetic system to help solve a clinical case study problem, or to experiment with a model already constructed. This study investigated two model-based learning approaches: (1) Model-Provided Learning and (2) Model-Assembling Learning. It was hypothesized that Model-Assembling learning would allow participants to use more inductive reasoning strategies by creating their own model and promote self-reflection on a specific mental model. Furthermore, it was believed that this approach would allow participants to make their mental models explicit and test them against the mathematical and scientific models (i.e., conceptual models) presented to them during the instruction. Results indicated that metacognitive awareness as measured by the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) was not a good predictor for learning outcomes as measured by an instructor-developed exam. The Model-Assembling group outperformed the Model-Provided group on an Instructor-Developed test designed to measure both basic-level and inference-level comprehension of the concepts of pharmacokinetics presented in the case study problem. Descriptive data collected provided an understanding of the nature of the strategic knowledge (cognitive and metacognitive) that students brought to bear on the problem-solving tasks using the software and materials provided. Mental model analyses of concept maps drawn by a select number of participants indicated that they had to actively test and revise their mental via a trial-and-error approach using STELLA. Recommendations are provided for educators interested in using model-based learning activities and modeling tools such as STELLA to teach complex science concepts. These recommendations are based on a comparison of the results of this study along with an analysis of relevant research literature. Recommendations include the use of support measures, model progression techniques, adequate training, collaborative learning, and other learning environment issues.

T1  - Children's concepts: Tools for transforming science teachers' knowledge
AN  - 619422396; 1999-11239-001
AB  - Examined the roles that students' science concepts play in promoting teachers' professional growth. Two cohorts of teachers (N = 26 and 30) participated in the study as part of a constructivist-based graduate course on elementary and middle school science methods. A modified learning cycle was used during course instruction as a framework for teachers to explore sound, light, and electricity. Data on teachers' pedagogical and conceptual growth was obtained from pre- and postconcept maps, journal reflections, and portfolios. Results of the concept map analysis showed that teachers' maps became more integrated and cohesive as seen in the increase of crosslinks, hierarchies, and relationships drawn for each science topic. The journals and portfolios showed that students' science knowledge served as discrepant events that evoked teachers' dissatisfaction with their own content knowledge and motivated them to reconsider their pedagogical practices. Students' concepts also served as change agents, resulting in changes in teachers' views of their roles and instructional behaviors. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Children as scientists: Adding, connecting and elaborating ideas on the way to conceptual development
AN  - 619439928; 1999-95013-077
AB  - In this study, I explored how children develop and construct their ideas and alternative frameworks in science. Prior work in this area suggested that changes from alternative conceptions to understandings that more closely resemble scientists' models do not occur in a sequential, linear fashion, nor are they easily accomplished. By employing a constructivist framework grounded in dynamic systems to look at learning, alternative conceptions were viewed not as ideas that need to be "confronted and replaced" but rather as pieces of an intricate puzzle of understanding that when combined create a more complete, functional, continuous understanding of science. Specifically, the study examined students' understandings and conceptualizations of light as they studied it formally for eight weeks. Understandings were measured through interviews, student-generated concept maps, classroom interactions and by examining student work samples. The central questions guiding the investigation were: What were children's (ages 9 and 10) conceptions of light? Did children's ideas about light develop during their eight week study of it? If so, what was the nature of these changes? Results from the study indicated that children had numerous ideas about light before their formal study of it based on their experiences with the world. As children studied light, they learned about it in the dynamic, synergistic and interactive processes of adding new ideas, connecting ideas to one another and elaborating understandings to arrive at progressively more complex and scientific understandings of light. Alternative conceptions, served as both productive and non-productive resources for learning. Further, alternative conceptions and prior understandings did not disappear as children developed their ideas about light. Rather "old" ideas were used and reused to provide support the gradual process of cognitive development of children's ideas about light. Findings from this study can be used to provide science instruction that is both rich in content and rich in opportunities to experience the recursive and dynamic nature of science learning.

T1  - The effects of a shared, intranet science learning environment on the academic behaviors of problem-solving and metacognitive reflection
AN  - 619441225; 1999-95009-131
AB  - This study investigated the effects of a shared, Intranet science environment on the academic behaviors of problem-solving and metacognitive reflection. Seventy-eight subjects included 9th and 10th grade male and female biology students. A quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-test data collection and randomization occurring through assignment of biology classes to traditional or shared, Intranet learning groups was employed. Pilot, web-based distance education software (CourseInfo) created the Intranet learning environment. A modified ecology curriculum provided contextualization and content for traditional and shared learning environments. The effect of this environment on problem-solving, was measured using the standardized Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal test. Metacognitive reflection, was measured in three ways: (a) number of concepts used, (b) number of concept links noted, and (c) number of concept nodes noted. Visual learning software, Inspiration, generated concept maps. Secondary research questions evaluated the pilot CourseInfo software for (a) tracked user movement, (b) discussion forum findings, and (c) difficulties experienced using CourseInfo software. Analysis of problem-solving group means reached no levels of significance resulting from the shared, Intranet environment. Paired t-Test of individual differences in problem-solving reached levels of significance. Analysis of metacognitive reflection by number of concepts reached levels of significance. Metacognitive reflection by number of concept links noted also reach significance. No significance was found for metacognitive reflection by number of concept nodes. No gender differences in problem-solving ability and metacognitive reflection emerged. Lack of gender differences in the shared, Intranet environment strongly suggests an equalizing effect due to the cooperative, collaborative nature of Intranet environments. Such environments appeal to, and rank high with, the female gender. Tracking learner movements in web-based, science environments has metacognitive and problem-solving learner implications. CourseInfo software offers one method of informing instruction within web-based learning environments focusing on academic behaviors. A shared, technology-supported learning environment may pose one model which science classrooms can use to create equitable scientific study across gender. The lack of significant differences resulting from this environment presents one model for improvement of individual problem-solving ability and metacognitive reflection across gender.

T1  - The effects of feedback cues, relevant information, and scoring procedures on concept mapping performance
AN  - 619444012; 1999-95005-138
AB  - The effects of different types of feedback and scoring algorithms on concept mapping performance were investigated. Four hundred and sixty-five undergraduate life science students studying genetics participated. Students were randomly assigned to one of eight groups in a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design. The topic was mitosis and meiosis. All concept mapping data were collected on the computer. There were two different contrasting approaches to scoring of concept map data, two levels of access to additional information about the concepts, and two different cues given to subjects regarding the meaning of the feedback they were presented. The two scoring algorithms represent theoretically distinct approaches to providing feedback to students. One scoring method comes from a traditional static conceptualization of cognitive structure while the other scoring method relies upon a mathematical modeling procedure derived from macro dynamic system theory. Both scoring procedures used the same composite expert criterion. Students were either provided with strategic (outcome) feedback cueing, or they were given cognitive feedback cueing. Significant differences were found for the type of feedback cueing presented to students. Students who were presented with cognitive outscored those given outcome feedback. Additional analyses revealed that students who had less relevant prior knowledge of the topic area profited from cognitive feedback and access to additional information on concepts. Students with high prior knowledge did better on the mapping task when they had access to additional relevant information. No significant differences were found from scoring procedures. The results of this research are discussed in light of the limitations and implications of the study. One outcome of the study is that concept maps have become a regular part of the instructional experience for students of this course at this major four-year university. Continuing research that builds on this study is also described. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effectiveness of learning with concept mapping on the science problem-solving of sixth-grade children
AN  - 619440780; 1999-95005-192
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship of concept mapping to science problem solving in sixth grade elementary school children. The study proposes to determine whether the students' ability to perform higher cognitive processes was a predictor of students' performance in solving problems in science and whether gender and socioeconomic status are related to performance in solving problems. Two groups participated in the study. Both groups were given a pre-test of higher cognitive ability--the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Ability. One group received instruction on a science unit of study in concept mapping format and the other group received instruction in traditional format. The instruction lasted approximately 4 weeks. Both groups were given a problem-solving post-test. A comparison of post-test means was done using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) as the statistical procedure with scores on the test of higher cognitive ability as the covariate. Also, Multiple Regression was performed to analyze the influence of participants' gender and socioeconomic status on their performance in solving problems. Results from the analysis of covariance showed that the group receiving instruction in the concept mapping format performed significantly better than the group receiving instruction in traditional format. Also the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes emerged to be a predictor of performance on problem solving. There was no significant difference in the analysis of the performance of males and females. No pattern emerged regarding the influence of socioeconomic status on problem solving performance. In conclusion, the study showed that concept mapping improved problem solving in the classroom, and that gender and socioeconomic status are not predictors of student success in problem solving.

T1  - The effect of the use of concept maps on community college students' conceptual understanding of biology course content
AN  - 619443009; 1999-95001-107
AB  - Purpose of the study. The major purpose of this study was to measure the change, if any, in students' conceptual understanding of biology course content using concept maps (experimental) or a standard lecture format (control). In addition, the effectiveness of the use of concept maps as advance organizers was measured according to the various subgroups of cognitive development level, age, ethnicity, gender, class time, and educational background. A final concern was the relationships between conceptual understanding of biology course content and the students' cognitive development level. Procedure. A quasi-experimental design was used to conduct the study during a sixteen-week semester. The study was conducted during the fall, 1997, semester at a community college using 190 students enrolled in General Biology 1406. Major data were collected using a pretest, posttest, and the Test of Logical Thinking. Data were treated through the application of analysis of covariance, Pearson product-moment correlation, and the Fisher Z-transformation technique. Findings. The findings of this investigation were as follows: (1) Concept maps used as advance organizers had a significant effect on student conceptual understanding of biology course content. (2) The use of concept maps as advance organizers had a significant effect on student conceptual understanding of biology when students are classified according to their cognitive developmental level, age, gender, major, course time, and educational background. (3) A significant relationship between cognitive developmental level and conceptual understanding was also found. Conclusions. The use of concept maps, as advance Organizers, is an effective method for improving student learning in general biology classes. A positive relationship exists between students' cognitive developmental level and conceptual understanding. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Learning to relate qualitative and quantitative problem representations in a model-based setting for collaborative problems solving
AN  - 619420540; 1999-10985-001
AB  - Investigated how 24 10th graders acquire, extend, and successively relate knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects of classical mechanics. In the 1st phase of the study, Ss were taught either qualitative or quantitative aspects of classical mechanics by means of 2 different instructional units. In both units, concept maps were used for the presentation of information. In the 2nd phase, dyads were formed with Ss who worked on different instructional units and thus possessed different knowledge. The 2 Ss then collaboratively worked on problems that were beyond their competence and demanded the coordinated use of knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects. During the collaborative problem solving, protocols were taken of the Ss' mutual exchange of information. An analysis of the multicomponent tests revealed that qualitative as well as quantitative knowledge can successfully be taught by means of concept maps. Ss who initially were taught qualitative aspects of physics gained significantly more from the information provided by their quantitatively instructed partners during the collaborative problem solving than the other way around. Ss gradually shifted their focus from quantitative to qualitative problem representations during collaborative problem solving. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Reducing task-related variance in performance assessment using concept maps
AN  - 619380160; 1998-95023-085
AB  - Task-related variance causes scores from performance assessments not to be generalizable and thus inappropriate for high stakes use. It is possible that task-related variance is due, in part, to students' inability to transfer their knowledge consistently from one assessment task to another. If this is so, then a cognitive tool such as a concept map might be useful. This study examines the effects of concept maps on the task-related variance components of Political Science performance assessments. On three in-class graded exercises, some students used concept maps while writing two essays, while other students did not. The task variance components remained unchanged across groups, but the subject main effect components increased and the subject-by-task interaction components decreased. Also, the scores from the concept mapping groups had higher generalizability coefficients than for those who did not use a concept map. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Using concept maps to assess student learning in the science classroom: Must different methods compete?
AN  - 619367546; 1998-11687-002
AB  - A method of scoring concept maps was developed to assess knowledge and comprehension levels of science achievement in students in 7th- grade life science classes with the students' regular teacher serving as teacher/researcher. By linking scoring of concept maps to instructional objectives, scores were based upon the correctness of propositions. High correlations between the concept map scores and unit multiple choice tests provided strong evidence of the content validity of the map scores. Correlations between map scores and state criterion-referenced and national norm-referenced standardized tests were indicators of high concurrent validity. This approach to concept map scoring represents a distinct departure from traditional methods that focus on characteristics such as hierarchy and branching. A large body of research (e.g., M. A. Ruiz-Primo and R. Shavelson, 1996) has demonstrated the utility of such methods in the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes. Results suggest that a concept map might be used in assessing declarative and procedural knowledge, both of which have a place in the science classroom. Results suggest that science curriculum and its corresponding assessment need not be dichotomized into knowledge/comprehension vs higher-order outcomes.

AB  - Within a sociocultural context, this study examined how science teachers' knowledge of science and science pedagogy changed as a result of participating in a constructivist-based graduate science methods course. 14 elementary and middle school science teachers worked with an assigned partner for the duration of the course. Teachers with more than 5 yrs of experience were paired with teachers who had 5 or fewer yrs of experience. Results from pre- and postinstruction concept maps, journals, portfolios, and transcripts of discourse revealed that within the zone of proximal development, peers, teachers' students, instructors, readings, and tools mediated the development of content and pedagogical knowledge.

T1  - Usefulness of concept maps in college chemistry laboratories: Students' perceptions and effects on achievement
AN  - 619363150; 1998-11037-003
AB  - The problem addressed by this study is that 1st-yr college chemistry students learn little of the conceptual material associated with the chemistry experiments they perform. The thesis of this research is that the construction of prelab and postlab concept maps help students understand the concepts involved in the experiments they perform. The study was conducted using 32 non-science majors enrolled in a 1st-yr chemistry course. The experimental group constructed prelab and postlab concept maps, while the control group wrote essays explaining the conceptual chemistry of the 4 experiments used in this study. Both groups took 25-item achievement tests 1 wk after each experiment. Prelab and postlab concept maps were scored and evaluated for significant differences. Five students were interviewed to investigate their perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in chemistry laboratories. No significant differences were found between treatment groups with respect to students' conceptual understanding as determined by the multiple choice achievement tests. Students responded very positively toward the use of concepts maps in the laboratory. They felt strongly that constructing prelab and postlab concept maps helped them understand the conceptual chemistry of the experiments. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Conquering the perfect girl myth: Achievement based role models and adolescent girls
AN  - 619378587; 1998-95020-300
AB  - Adolescence is not an easy time for girls, they experience eating disorders, depression, negative body image and suicide attempts at a significantly greater rate than their male peers. Brown and Gilligan (1992) talked with hundreds of adolescent girls and found that many girls imagine a mythical "perfect girl" whose unattainable and unrealizable characteristics contributes to the disintegration of their own voices and hopes. This research seeks to identify intervention factors that might help girls resist the "perfect girl" images that surround them. The hypothesis is that by making a young girl familiar with women who are accomplished in the worlds of business, science, law, sports or letters, she will improve her achievement orientation, reduce personal anxiety (worries), and reach a better understanding of how her life can be linked to adult accomplishments. The research uses Sheroes!, a 37 minute video created by the author, that draws examples from interviews with 120 accomplished American women. By proxy, the women candidly discuss their accomplishments and reflect on their adolescence. The short term effect of watching Sheroes! was measured in a group of seventh grade girls at Lansing Middle School in Lansing, New York. During the experiment both control and experimental groups were pre-tested for self-esteem and self-concept. Concept mapping was used to express and then assess changes in cognitive structure. It was expected that the control group's pre and post maps would remain stable, while the experimental group's maps would show change in a positive manner. The study shows that viewing Sheroes! had a measurable effect. Analysis of the data for the five dependent variables revealed significant differences in the pre and post maps for the experimental group in the direction predicted for three of the variables, and a trend in a positive direction for a fourth. Sheroes!, or its equivalent, has promise as a means to provide role concepts for girls as they struggle with popular culture and the pressures of adolescence. The research results suggest that even though it is a minimal intervention, exposing girls to the authentic voices of real women has a significant cognitive impact.

T1  - The use of metacognitive tools in a multidimensional research program
AN  - 619376365; 1998-95019-146
AB  - Metacognition may be thought of as "cognition about cognition", or "thinking about thinking." A number of strategies and tools have been developed to help individuals understand the nature of knowledge, and to enhance their "thinking about thinking." Two metacognitive tools, concept maps and Gowin's Vee, were first developed for use in educational research. Subsequently, they were used successfully to help learners "learn how to learn." The success of metacognitive tools in educational settings suggests that they may help scientists understand the nature of knowledge production and organization, thereby facilitating their research activities and enhancing their understanding of the events and objects they study. In September 1993 I began an ethnographic, naturalistic study of the United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service - Rhizobotany Project at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I spent the next two and one-half years as a participant observer with the Project. The focus of my research was to examine the application of metacognitive tools to an academic research setting. The knowledge claims that emerged from my research were: (1) Individual researchers tended to have narrow views of the Rhizobotany Project that centered on their individual areas of research; (2) The researchers worked in "conceptual isolation", or failing to see the connections and interrelatedness of their own work with the work of the others; (3) For those researchers who constructed concept maps and Vee diagrams, these heuristics helped them to build a deeper conceptual understanding of their own work; and (4) Half of the members of the research team did not find concept mapping and Vee diagramming useful. Their reluctance to use these tools was interpreted as an indication of epistemological confusion. The prevalence of conceptual isolation and epistemological confusion among members of the Rhizobotany Project parallels the results of previous studies that have demonstrated the instability and inconsistency of science students' and researchers' epistemological commitments and beliefs.

T1  - The relationship of multiple intelligences profiles to success in computer-based concept mapping
AN  - 619377112; 1998-95017-055
AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of concepts and their interconnections. Research has shown that concept maps reflect the student's cognitive structure, enabling both teachers and students to determine the level of understanding of material attained before, during or after instruction. Several studies have determined that the addition of the use of a computer-based concept mapping tool for preparing maps increases the level of complexity of students' maps. However, not all students are successful mappers, whether prepared on a computer or drawn with paper-and-pencil. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between preservice teachers' multiple intelligences profiles, as defined by the work of Howard Gardner (1983), and the levels of complexity in their computer-based concept maps. This study was conducted with preservice teachers (N = 20) enrolled in a science methods course at a northeastern university graduate program. After an initial questionnaire to determine their computer and academic background and prior exposure to concept mapping, students received instruction on how to develop concept maps and on how to create concept maps using the computer-based concept mapping tool, Inspiration. They completed the MIDAS instrument to determine their individual intelligence profiles. A unit on the 'Phases of the Moon' was taught, after which the subjects took a paper-and-pencil test and then prepared computer-based concept maps of their understanding of the material. The findings in the study substantiated the hypothesis that strengths in multiple intelligences were predictive of success in concept mapping. Using the Pearson product-moment correlation, one intelligence, musical-rhythmic, produced a significant correlation (r = 0.54, p < 5.05) with the level of complexity in the preservice teachers' concept maps. Ability in music and success in concept mapping both require higher order thinking skills, suggesting that success in concept mapping can be increased among students, when concept mapping is used consciously to develop higher order thinking. Ascertaining students' multiple intelligences profiles can increase teachers' understanding of their cognitive abilities and shed light upon the underlying influences in cognitive tasks such as concept mapping.

T1  - Students' concept patterns revealed by computer analysis of language-constrained science concept maps
AN  - 619376518; 1998-95007-044
AB  - This dissertation consists of four studies that develop a computer-based methodology to construct and evaluate concept maps to explore commonalities in students' representation of ideas in a domain. It also explores whether a progression in learning is evident in concept maps of cross-age students who have experienced a similar curriculum. The first two studies determine the validity and reliability of the language-constrained concept mapping using The Computer-assisted Concept Mapper as a software analog to traditional concept mapping. Students manipulate teacher-provided concepts and linking phrases; the program encodes each concept map to preserve the relations and equivalent topology. Validity and reliability of this approach is confirmed. The third study explores the ability of The Concept Map Analyzer hypercard stack to analyze a large number of concept maps and discriminate groups of similar maps. Three hundred seventy-eight sixth, ninth, and twelfth grade students in one school district created concept maps selecting from thirty provided concepts and ten linking phrases related to the water cycle. All pairs of maps are compared for similarities in concepts used and concepts-connected. The algorithm, based on the Pathfinder analysis C-measure, divides the set of common elements by the set of all elements in both concept maps. The similarity ratios which define the congruence between each pair of maps are subjected to cluster analysis to identify groups of similar maps. The number of concepts used and concepts-connected increases from sixth through twelfth grade; however, all three grade levels are represented in each of the seven clusters. The fourth study explores represented levels of understanding. Software provides a graphic composite of each cluster that shows relations selected by at least the specified percentage of students. The complexity and richness of composite maps generally increases with grade level; however, grade-level composites in this study show only weak differences and progression in understanding for this domain. This method of analyzing large numbers of concept maps reveals gaps in understanding, alternative relationships, and common beliefs of groups. This information may be useful when designing instruction for conceptual learning, evaluating the effectiveness of a curriculum, or developing a group's shared vision.

T1  - Using explanatory knowledge during collaborative problem solving in science
AN  - 619375073; 1998-12545-004
AB  - Evaluated the effects of a scaffolded explanation-based approach to collaborative discussion on students' understanding of photosynthesis. 48 4th- and 5th-grade students, identified as having high or average "intentional" approaches to learning, were divided into 3 groups (high, average control, and average intervention). Students worked both collaboratively and individually on 2 reasoning tasks in the domain of photosynthesis. The results of the concept-mapping tasks indicate that the average intervention group developed a more accurate scientific and functional understanding of photosynthesis than the average control group who did not receive the intervention. The scaffolded explanation-based intervention did not have a significant effect on the structure of students' explanations. The importance of the nature of students' discussion to advance their beliefs about scientific phenomena is supported and the usefulness of explanation and concept-mapping techniques as evaluative measures of student knowledge during collaborative problem solving is emphasized. Appendices of the Revised Implicit Learning Theory Interview, list of links for concept map, Problem-Explanation Task on Photosynthesis, and an overview of procedure are provided.

AN  - 619336527; 1998-02830-004
AB  - Reports on 69 preservice teachers' (aged 19–49 yrs) use of a concept mapping tool to create and modify concept maps about science-related curriculum content knowledge. The preservice teachers who used the tool were planning science-based instruction that would be delivered to an elementary school class. Data gathered from interviews, journals and analysis of the concept maps constructed showed how the preservice students used the concept mapping tool to construct their curriculum content knowledge in the form of more powerful integrated patterns. It was also found that the process of concept map construction enhanced preservice teacher skills in planning instruction. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of Gowin's Vee heuristic diagraming and concept mapping on meaningful learning in the radiation science classroom and laboratory
AN  - 619259673; 1997-95023-244
AB  - The effects of Vee heuristic diagraming and concept mapping utilization during classroom and laboratory learning by college level nuclear medicine technology students were investigated in this study. Meaningful learning was evidenced by group performance gains, positive attitudinal preferences, and student misconception identification and remediation. The effects of the learning intervention on group performance gains were calculated for two groups of 16 students each. The effect size was a moderate to large effect of 0.66. An ANCOVA was conducted for group performances using the student's SAT score as the covariate. The group differences were significant at the 0.05 level. There were no significant differences based on gender. ANOVA analyses were conducted to test for SAT category efficacy. There were significant differences based on SAT category (p = 0.024), with the groups falling into the low and moderate SAT categories showing the greatest gains in using the learning intervention (effect sizes of 0.81 and 0.77, respectively). Attitudinal preferences toward Vee diagraming and concept mapping were identified. After 21 weeks of using the learning intervention, 72% of the respondents could agree with, or did not oppose Vee diagraming and concept mapping as a learning modality. A qualitative analysis of the learning intervention was conducted. The student Vee diagrams and concept maps were successfully utilized as interaction guides in order to identify student misconceptions, and to successfully facilitate remediation in the form of a cognitive congruence between the student and the instructor. The convergence of the quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that this learning intervention did encourage meaningful learning, as seen in group performance gains and remediative teacher-student interactions, and as such, confirms the Ausubel-Novak-Gowin theory of meaningful learning.

T1  - Psychometric and edumetric validity of dimensions of geomorphological knowledge which are tapped by concept mapping
AN  - 619214243; 1997-43545-005
AB  - The validity of several dimensions of knowledge which were inferred from concept maps was assessed for its psychometric and edumetric aspects. Data were collected from 14 students who enrolled in the university first-year introductory geomorphology course and in its prerequisite introductory geology course. They took an objective geomorphology test, the tree construction task, and the Standardized Concept Structuring Analysis Technique (SConSAT) version of concept mapping. Comparisons among these dimensions of knowledge before and after the geomorphology course yielded convergent evidence. For the psychometric perspective, the SConSAT version of concept mapping and tree construction had similar knowledge structure representations, and the cognitive map correctness was moderately positively correlated with the objective test but not with the geomorphology course test. For the edumetric perspective, the majority of the dimensions of knowledge structures from the SConSAT showed large improvements following the geomorphology course. This evidence shows that the knowledge structure dimensions have moderate to good construct validity which warrant their widespread use for evaluating learning outcomes in both experimental and classroom settings.

T1  - Examining the construction process: A study of changes in Level 10 students' understanding of classical mechanics
AN  - 619098792; 1997-05517-002
AB  - Explored 22 students' conceptual understanding and conceptual growth regarding classical mechanics in the natural context of a Grade-10 science classroom. The goal was to determine the pervasiveness of a pattern observed in an earlier study (Shymansky et al, 1993) in which learners initially gave evidence of scientifically valid knowledge structures but then returned or regressed to an earlier primitive level of understanding. In the current study, concept mapping and interview methods were used to capture Ss' construction of knowledge patterns across a survey course designed to focus on big ideas in physics. Analyses of mean ratings of student-generated concept maps and interview transcripts over 3 data collections did not consistently reveal the progression–regression patterns across the instruction. Ss' knowledge structures remained stable across the 10 wks and at 4-wk follow-up. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Knowledge restructuring in the life sciences: A longitudinal study of conceptual change in biology
AN  - 619121680; 1997-06858-004
AB  - Examined successive and progressive changes in the structural complexity of knowledge held by introductory, college-level biology students and how those changes are affected by the students' primary learning mode and gender. To examine the way learners restructure knowledge over the course of a semester, 67 male and 94 female science and nonscience majors constructed concept maps at 4-wk intervals throughout the term. The maps were then evaluated for structural complexity and change based on the works of other investigators. Results suggest that a substantial amount of knowledge restructuring takes place and that much of it is incremental in nature. The observed relationships between knowledge restructuring and predominant learning mode and gender of students are potentially significant. The evidence suggests that students who use "active," "deep" information processing strategies construct more elaborate, well-differentiated knowledge structures. Furthermore, it appears that gender may be an important mediator of meaningful learning. It is particularly noted that where gender differences were found, they tended to favor females.

T1  - A qualitative analysis of gender differences in the experience of depressive symptoms
AN  - 619241070; 1997-95002-243
AB  - It is well established that women as opposed to men are more frequently identified as exhibiting depressive symptoms and are diagnosed as experiencing unipolar depression. Despite variations in research methodology or diagnostic criteria, women as opposed to men predominate in treated and untreated cases of depression by a ratio of approximately 2 to 1. Significantly higher rates of unipolar depression have been found among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic women as opposed to men in these ethnic groups. These phenomenon appear to hold true even after factors such as levels of income, occupation, and education are controlled. This trend is evidenced for women in the United States as well as for women in western European countries. Various theories have been proposed to explain these phenomena. These theories represent a broad range of perspectives including learned helplessness theory, coping theory, gender role theory, and biological or hormonal factors unique to women. However, no research based on these theoretical explanations has yet completely accounted for the predominance of women regarding depression and depressive symptoms. This investigation is phenomenologically focused, aimed at the identification and exploration of latent constructs salient to women's and men's experience of depressive symptoms. This investigation employs a two-study research design that blends qualitative and quantitative research strategies. In Study 1 an alternative research methodology, concept mapping, was used to elicit and graphically represent participants' perceptions of depressive experience. Participants in Study 1 were community college students (n = 59). Qualitative data reduction was also employed to derive a depressive symptom inventory based on these perceptions. In Study 2 this questionnaire was administered to a larger sample (n = 393) of community college students. Stepwise discriminate function and regression analysis were employed to determine the variat (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Evaluating behavioral and cognitive task analysis methods for the design of training for technical troubleshooters
AN  - 619240033; 1997-95001-050
AB  - Task analysis delineates how experts use learned skills to perform complex work. Task analysis specifies the knowledge which skilled performers have encoded into schema and mental models, as well as how they operationalize this knowledge. Task analysis, therefore, is a key component of instructional design, as well as of related areas such as systems analysis and design; knowledge engineering, elicitation, acquisition, and representation; psychological or mental testing; performance analysis; job analysis; business process engineering; and performance technology. Ironically, task analysis methods have not received enough systematic examination. There are well over a hundred task analysis methods and variations, most inadequately specified and validated, and no generally accepted taxonomies to classify either tasks and task analysis methods. Thus, task analysis method selection is now more art than science. This study develops a framework adapted from psychological testing for the comparative analysis of task analysis methods and evaluates several methods: the PAQ, task description, PARI, GOMS, think-aloud protocol analysis, and concept mapping. Training for technical troubleshooting is the focus of this evaluation, but the framework generalizes to other uses of task analysis and other domains of knowledge. Anderson's theory of cognition and knowledge types is advanced as a basis for further work on taxonomies for tasks and task analysis methods, as well as a system for matching task and appropriate analytical methods.

T1  - Problems and issues in the use of concept maps in science assessment
AN  - 618866741; 1996-05582-001
AB  - A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes. A student's concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in his or her memory (cognitive structure). The purpose of this article is to examine the validity of claims that concept maps measure an important aspect of students' knowledge structures in a subject domain such as science. The review led to the following conclusions: (a) an integrative working cognitive theory is needed to limit the current variation in concept-mapping techniques for assessment purposes; (b) before concept maps are used for assessment and before map scores are reported to teachers, students, the public, and policy makers, research needs to provide reliability and validity information on the effect of different mapping techniques; and (c) research on students' facility in using concept maps, on training techniques, and on the effect on teaching is needed if concept map assessments are to be used in classrooms and in large-scale accountability systems.

T1  - The effectiveness of concept and software mapping for representing student data and process schema in science
AN  - 618998595; 1996-95014-094
AB  - This study explored the potential of students' science schema. It focuses on two mapping techniques: concept mapping and software mapping. Concept mapping representing data schema was used for assessment of student achievement. Software mapping representing process schema was used to assess students' interactions with the software program. The purposes of the study were: (1) to investigate the relationships between concept mapping and software mapping techniques, (2) to show that software mapping is as effective as concept mapping as a vehicle for defining students' science achievement schemata, and (3) to provide a basis for "standardization" in the assessment of science schema with software use. The study showed that there is a positive relationship (.84) between concept mapping and software mapping. This relationship supports the notion that these two kinds of techniques can represent schema, and there seems to be a relationship between data and process schema. It could be said that software mapping can be used as a valid and reliable achievement tool as well as concept mapping. The subjects were divided into two study groups (Group I and Group II) for concept mapping and software mapping activities. The results showed that there is no significant difference between Group I and Group II on concept mapping and software mapping scores. It means that the order of the activity, doing concept mapping or software mapping as a first or second activity, has no effect on the results. From an information processing perspective, the functional behavior of subjects in the study explained the relationship between observable stimuli (input) and observable responses (output). The protocol analysis showed that an interaction with computer software provided more cognitive activation and stimulation than concept mapping for children. Also, the software mapping application provided more information about science schema than the concept mapping activities during the think-aloud p (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effective use of analogies in earth science
AN  - 618998150; 1996-95014-193
AB  - This study examined the effect of prior knowledge and teaching method on the learning of earth science concepts with analogies. Research questions looked at whether greater conceptual learning occurred with analogies when learners had prior knowledge of the subject and when learners were explicitly taught the limitations of the analogy. Research questions also examined whether identified misconceptions increased or decreased after analogy instruction. Concept maps and a multiple-choice test were used to assess prior knowledge, detect misconceptions, and assess conceptual knowledge. An additional example-non-example test was also used as a post-test. Experimental groups did significantly better than a non-instructional control group on the multiple-choice assessment. The experimental group also had significantly higher post-test than pre-test scores. Significant differences between the prior knowledge and teaching method groups were not detected on the multiple-choice and concept map assessments. However, a significant interaction between prior knowledge and teaching method was detected on the example-non-example test. The source of this interaction was in the high prior knowledge groups. The high prior knowledge group taught with the no-limitations teaching method had a higher mean score than the high prior knowledge group taught with the limitations teaching method. The various assessments highlighted some possible misconceptions such as the plates being viewed as a layer separate from the crust and/or mantle, and raised questions about the objective quantification of those misconceptions. Assessment of prior knowledge, differences between analogy teaching method groups, and problems scoring concept maps were also discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of student-constructed concept maps on achievement in a first-year college instructional chemistry laboratory
AN  - 618996213; 1996-95008-214
AB  - Instructional science laboratories are important in the training of non-science and science students, because in these laboratories students learn how to explore the natural world. The quality of chemistry laboratory instruction has been declining due to rising costs, safety concerns, and an emphasis on manipulative skills. Traditionally, there have been few instructional strategies which promote conceptual understanding by laboratory students. The problem addressed by this study is that first-year college chemistry students learn very little of the conceptual material associated with chemistry experiments they perform. The construction of concept maps, based on the constructivist learning theory, is a technique previously developed to help students learn the conceptual material associated with laboratory work. The thesis of this research is that the construction of a prelab concept map, and the restructuring of this map during and after the laboratory period, help students understand the concepts involved in the experiments they perform. The study was conducted using 32, all female, non-science majors enrolled in a first-year chemistry course covering general and organic chemistry. Only the laboratory portion of the course was used in this study. The experimental group constructed prelab and postlab concept maps, while the control group wrote essays explaining the conceptual chemistry of the four experiments used in this study. Both groups took 25-item achievement tests one week after each experiment. The experimental group turned in prelab and postlab concept maps, which were scored and evaluated for significant differences. Five students in the experimental group were interviewed at the end of the semester to investigate their perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in chemistry laboratories. No significant differences were found between treatment groups with respect to students' conceptual understanding as determined by the multiple-choice achievem (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Assessing conceptual change through concept mapping
AN  - 618750654; 1995-95016-106
AB  - This study used a microgenetic methodological approach to investigate the power of concept mapping to detect daily changes in learners' cognitive structures. Nineteen mathematics and science teachers attending a five-day symbolism on fractals, chaos, and dynamics constructed a series of five concept maps. The first concept map was drawn prior to the beginning of the symbolism, and the remaining four concept maps were drawn after each day of instruction. Concept maps were scored using a scoring algorithm developed by Novak and Gowin in 1984. Scores were used to quantify changes in subjects' conceptions of subject-matter content over the five days of the symbolism. Conceptual change was measured by subjects' use of propositions, levels, cross links, and a summary score. Subjects' attitudes toward concept mapping also were assessed. Subjects responded to a questionnaire concerning (a) their desire to learn more about concept mapping, (b) their intent to use concept mapping in the future, and (c) the advantages and disadvantages of concept mapping as an assessment tool and as a learning tool. Subjects also completed a semantic differential scale eliciting affective responses regarding their perceptions of concept mapping. Data were analyzed to determine the quantitative changes in subjects' concept maps and the associated trends. Multivariate analysis of variance techniques revealed significant differences (p <) in means across the five days for each dependent variable (propositions, levels, cross links, and summary scores). Orthogonal polynomial contrasts identified a linear trend (p <1) for each of the dependent variables across time. Helmert contrasts detected daily differences (p <) in means for all dependent variables except levels. Analysis of the semantic differential scale indicated a global acceptance of concept mapping. Subjects expressed a desire to learn more about concept mapping and an intent to use concept mapping in the future. The re (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The validity of concept maps for assessing cognitive structure
AN  - 618745655; 1995-95008-150
AB  - Concept maps are used to assess student comprehension in structured domains such as biology and physics. Numerous studies report that concept mapping training in combination with domain instruction changes students' cognitive structures. However, no reliability data exists for this instrument and validity data is almost nonexistent. This paper examines the reliability and validity of concept maps as an index of cognitive structure. Three groups of graduate students in statistics and measurement classes served as subjects. The concept mapping trained students learned to draw concept maps prior to domain instruction. The concept mapping untrained students were encouraged to "draw a picture that reflects how you think" but were not trained in concept mapping procedures. The control group learned concept mapping after domain instruction. All groups completed a classroom achievement test, judged the similarity of pairs of concepts, and drew maps or pictorial representations twice after domain instruction. Maps and pictures were compared to the instructors' concept maps. The more similar a student's map is to the instructors' map, the higher the student's score. Students in the two concept mapping training groups drew maps that were reliable over time. Representations drawn by students in the concept mapping untrained group were not reliable. Students' concept maps after domain instruction were significantly more similar to the instructor's map than were students' maps prior to domain instruction. The group that received concept mapping training after domain instruction did not differ significantly from the group that was trained before instruction. This result is interpreted as supporting the validity of the concept map as an index of cognitive structure. The correlation between concept map scores and achievement test scores was fairly strong. This was interpreted as supporting the validity of concept maps. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The effects of concept mapping and cooperative learning experiences on achievement, transfer problem solving ability, and attitudes toward the instructional experience of middle school science students
AN  - 618743238; 1995-95008-048
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects on science achievement, transfer problem solving ability, and attitudes toward the instructional experience for students using concept mapping, cooperative learning, and a combination of concept mapping and cooperative learning in a unit of study. A concept map is a two-dimensional, visual representation of a body of knowledge. Proficiency in concept map construction fosters meaningful learning and positive attitudes toward school and subject. Cooperative learning strategies are structuring techniques for promoting productive student-student interaction in the classroom by creating a situation where each student's success is dependent upon the success of all group members. This study was an investigation of the possibility that a cooperative learning structure can provide the support necessary for middle school science students to experience success with concept mapping. In this 6-week study, intact classes of middle school science students constructing concept maps in cooperative learning groups were compared with classes constructing concept maps independently and with classes working cooperatively without concept mapping. At the end of one 3-week unit of study in science, and again at the end of a second 3-week unit, selected measures of science achievement and transfer problem solving ability were administered to all students to evaluate the effects of the different classroom structures on these dependent variables. A measure of attitudes toward the instructional experience was administered once when both 3-week units were completed. Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) conducted for all content units on pretest scores indicated that the treatment groups were generally equivalent on these variables before treatment began.

AN  - 618641253; 1995-23133-001
AB  - Reviews literature about teaching science. Teaching is defined in reference to changes in the learner and, thus, falls in the cognitive psychology tradition. Constructivism, a cognitive view that learners actively construct or formulate their own understandings of phenomena, is discussed. Building new schemata in the presence of misconceptions is addressed. Misconceptions can be addressed by using anomalous data, using text, creating cognitive conflict with discussion, using integrated approaches (the learning cycle), and using analogies. Also discussed is the building of new schemata in the absence of misconceptions through the use of analogies, examples, conceptual models, concept maps, discussion and dialogue, and student–student dialogue in cooperative learning. Motivation and interest are addressed, and remedial instruction and instruction for populations with disabilities are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Network representations of knowledge about chemical equilibrium: Variations with achievement
AN  - 618641191; 1995-23182-001
AB  - Examined variation in the organization of domain-specific knowledge by 50 Year-12 chemistry students and 4 chemistry teachers. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the Pathfinder network-generating algorithm (R. W. Schvaneveldt, 1990) were used to investigate individual and group differences in student concepts maps about chemical equilibrium. The network constructed from maps of higher achievers (
n = 32) showed greater coherence, more concordance in specific paired links, more important specific conceptual relationships, and greater hierarchical organization than did the network constructed from maps of lower achievers (
n = 22). Results suggest that transforming paired links in concept maps into proximity matrices for input to multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) provides a suitable methodology for comparing and documenting changes in the organization and structure of conceptual knowledge within and between individual students.

AN  - 618633002; 1995-23124-001
AB  - Investigated changes in 14 11th graders' understanding of acid, base, and pH concepts before, after, and during a series of acid–base titrations (ABTs) using 3 technologies: chemical indicators (CIs), pH meters (PHMs), and microcomputer-based laboratories (MBLs). Changes in Ss' understanding were analyzed by constructing concept maps (CMs) from the propositions they used in interviews before and after the ABTs. Ss using MBLs had a larger positive shift in their CM scores (CMSs), which indicates a greater differentiation and integration of their knowledge. CI Ss had a more moderate positive shift in their CMSs, and PHM Ss had a smaller positive shift. MBL Ss constructed more inappropriate links in their CMs than did the CI or PHM Ss, indicative of a high level of involvement with the technology. Results indicate that the level of information offered by the technology affected Ss' understanding of the chemical concepts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - A window into thinking: Using student writing to understand conceptual change in science learning
AN  - 618642183; 1995-23163-001
AB  - Followed conceptual changes shown in 25 6th-grade students' writing over a 12-wk unit on matter and molecules. Six target students completed pre- and posttests regarding their understanding of the unit's conceptual goals, and their classroom writings were used to construct concept maps. Maps were compared across time to assess changes in the schema of core concepts, complexity, and organization as a result of instruction. After patterns were located in target students' maps, the remaining 19 students' maps were analyzed for similar patterns. The ideas that students identified in their writing showed changes in all 3 areas as the lessons progressed. When instructional events were analyzed in relation to students' expressed ideas, comprehension of goal concepts appeared more often when students were able to explain their new ideas orally and in writing.

T1  - Understanding cellular respiration: An analysis of conceptual change in college biology
AN  - 618601047; 1995-03457-001
AB  - Documented the frequencies of conceptual difficulties confronted by college students trying to understand cellular respiration (CRes). Using concept maps, clinical interviews, and an open-ended instrument, viewpoints were elicited from 100 (novice) introductory biology students before and after relevant instruction in CRes and from 100 (experienced) students enrolled in advanced biology courses. Results show significant group differences in the frequencies of scientifically acceptable and alternative conceptions. Findings suggest that novices harbor a wide range of conceptual difficulties that constrain their understanding of CRes. Many of these difficulties persist after instruction and new ones arise. Often these conceptual problems, if not addressed in introductory classes, remain intact among experienced students despite well-planned, repeated instruction at advanced levels.

T1  - Student views of collaborative concept mapping: An emancipatory research project
AN  - 618495932; 1994-31422-001
AB  - Studied student's attitudes toward collaborative concept mapping in a high school physics class. 46 Ss, juniors in a Canadian private school, designed activities and experiments, negotiated the terms and modes of evaluation, and negotiated the structure of classroom interactions. Ss engaged in 5 activities: (1) experiments (the core activities), (2) reading relevant chapters in main text and additional available texts, (3) preparing weekly textbook questions and word problems, (4) writing essays on special topics not covered in the text, and (5) constructing concept maps that included the key ideas of the relevant chapter of the main text. Student evaluations largely supported the efficacy of concept mapping. The major implications of this project for teaching and research address how students use ideas to make sense of content presented, research design (by students), and the metaphor of cognitive design apprenticeships.

T1  - The concept map as a research and evaluation tool: Further evidence of validity
AN  - 618464896; 1994-23275-001
AB  - Examined the extent to which differences exist in the concept maps (CMs) of 25 advanced college biology majors and 25 beginning nonmajors in the domain of mammals. Furthermore, it explored whether these differences are reflected in the way Ss assign class membership as revealed in a card sorting task. Results indicate that CMs of biology majors were structurally more complex than those of nonmajors and that differences in the structural complexity and organizational patterns depicted in CMs were reflected in the underlying dimensions used to assign class membership. Together, these findings suggest that the CM provides a theoretically powerful and psychometrically sound tool for assessing conceptual change in experimental and classroom settings.

AB  - Addressed female college students' fundamental beliefs about nature, that is, the natural world. Data were collected via semistructured interviews involving a set of elicitation devices used to encourage Ss to talk about the natural world. Beliefs are presented in the form of a concept map and characterized by a set of bipolar descriptive codes: naturalism and religion; chaos and order; mystery and knowledge; function and purpose; mundane and special; and science/no science. Data indicate science's apparent lack of influence on students' beliefs about nature even though these students had been successful in college level science courses.

T1  - The concept map as a tool for the collaborative construction of knowledge: A microanalysis of high school physics students
AN  - 618322147; 1993-35371-001
AB  - Investigated concept mapping (CMP) as a means of assessing the quality of 29 male high school physics students' understanding from 2 perspectives: the analysis of the process of constructing meaning and the analysis of the products of this cognitive activity. Ss worked in collaborative groups during all of the concept mapping sessions. The concept maps as products differed in their hierarchical organization, the number of links, and the benefit to the individual Ss. Ss mediated propositions verbally and nonverbally, took adversarial positions and appealed to authority, and formed temporary alliances based on presumed expertise. CMP led to sustained discourse on the topic and improved the declarative knowledge of several Ss both in terms of hierarchical organization and local configuration of the concepts. It also let unintended and scientifically incorrect notions become ingrained and go unchallenged. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - An investigation of the effectiveness of concept mapping as an instructional tool
AN  - 618302339; 1993-27432-001
AB  - Conducted a meta-analysis of literature on the use of concept mapping (CM) as an instructional tool to determine the effectiveness of CM in student achievement and attitudes. The effectiveness of teacher-prepared vs student-prepared maps was also investigated, as was a potential gender effect. The major features of 19 studies were tabulated, and results were organized based on characteristics of the sample, treatment and control group, and the experimental design. CM had generally medium positive effects on student achievement and large positive effects on student attitudes. Improved achievement was more evident in studies that used biology as their content focus, and was also considerably stronger in studies that used conventional instruction rather than a placebo for their control groups. Student-prepared maps were not found to be more effective than teacher-prepared maps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The social construction of scientific concepts or the concept map as conscription device and tool for social thinking in high school science
AN  - 618259017; 1993-07429-001
AB  - Examined the social construction of knowledge of 123 high school students engaged in collaborative concept mapping (CM) and proposed a framework for understanding concept maps sociologically. An interpretive methodology based on constructivist inquiry by E. Guba and Y. S. Lincoln (1989), Lincoln and Guba (1985), and a constant comparative analysis by A. L. Strauss (1987) were used. CM fostered interactions that were not favorable to the development of complex expressions. CM provided a framework within which Ss engaged in sustained discourse over periods of 1 hr, the fixed set of concepts delimited the content of the discourse, and Ss built a map of thematic territory. CM, as a tool of social thinking, helped more in planning for appropriate group experiences and in adapting the CM teaching–learning heuristic for interactive classrooms.

T1  - A comprehensive use of concept mapping in design instruction and assessment
AN  - 618246229; 1993-03323-001
AB  - Describes the use of concept mapping (CM) in developing a hierarchically sequenced microbiology program for high school students. The impact of the new program on Ss' achievements was determined by comparing 218 Ss who studied the new program using CM themselves and 98 Ss who studied the new program without CM. CM Ss' overall gain was higher. Most Ss could perform CM by themselves or with little help from the teacher. Ss' and teachers' attitudes toward mapping were mostly favorable toward the cognitive benefits of CM. Many Ss did not like certain aspects of CM, including the fact that mapping is a moderately difficult task to master. It is concluded that some teachers exploit the potential of CM better than others. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Attitude of teachers towards concept mapping and vee diagramming as metalearning tools in science and mathematics
AN  - 618302149; 1993-27382-001
AB  - Examined teacher attitudes toward the metalearning tools, concept mapping and vee diagramming. The Attitude towards Concept- and Vee-Mapping Inventory was developed and validated. This instrument was used to collect data from 48 biology, 36 chemistry, 24 physics, and 33 math teachers who had been trained in and had used the 2 tools. Ss showed a largely favorable attitude toward learning the techniques and using them in teaching science rather than math. Both science and math teachers expressed views favoring both metalearning tools in terms of their benefits in the areas of meaningful learning and reduction of anxiety levels.

AB  - 23 male and 17 female undergraduates who experienced cooperative and individualistic concept mapping experiences for 6 mo and were adjudged to be good concept mappers were significantly more successful in solving 3 biology problems than were 20 undergraduates who served as controls. Written and think-aloud procedures and interviews were conducted as part of the administration of the Biology Problem Solving Test. Gender differences emerged in the ability to solve specific problems. No significant difference was found between students who mapped concepts cooperatively and those who mapped individually.

T1  - The concept map as an advance organizer
AN  - 618097047; 1992-10862-001
AB  - 40 of 82 8th-grade students in 4 science classes completed a concept map at the beginning of a 2-wk science unit under the teacher's supervision. At the end of the unit, a test was administered to the experimental and control groups. A 1-tailed 
t test indicated that the use of concept mapping as an advance organizer produced a significant academic gain. Three possible explanations are suggested: (1) Ss may have been helped by the organization and visual relationship of the advance organizer, (2) its construction by a teacher may have made the concept map more complete and accurate, or (3) a concept map development by the teacher may have provided the students with greater direction for learning the concepts and facts that overlapped with the teacher's final test.

AB  - Audio-tutorial science lessons were provided to 191 1st- and 2nd-grade children (instructed), and interviews were conducted periodically to assess changes in science concept understanding from Grades 1 through 12. 48 Ss not receiving audio-tutorial lessons in Grades 1 and 2 (uninstructed) were also interviewed periodically from Grades 1 through 12. Instructed Ss showed more valid concept understandings and fewer invalid concepts (misconceptions) than uninstructed Ss in Grades 2, 7, 10, and 12. Concept maps prepared from interview transcripts showed wide variation in knowledge for both groups, and concept maps scored using a scoring algorithm also showed significant differences favoring instructed Ss. A discussion of concept maps as a tool to represent knowledge structures is included. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Students' misunderstandings and misconceptions in college freshman chemistry (general and organic)
AN  - 617938072; 1991-19781-001
AB  - Freshman chemistry may be the most problematic traditional science discipline taught in the 1st yr of college due to the many abstract, nonintuitive concepts that are not directly interrelated. In such cases, general teaching strategy of concept mapping must be replaced by alternative specific strategies. Illustrative examples of students' learning difficulties and misconceptions in freshman general and organic chemistry are presented in the students' terms, followed by the corresponding successfully applied, specific, concept-oriented, eclectic intervention strategies that the author uses to overcome the difficulties. Students' misconceptions in freshman chemistry that are not interrelated logically and/or derived from one another are not prone to the general concept mapping approach and should be dealt with by using the appropriate, specific teaching strategy.

AN  - 617937277; 1991-19705-001
AB  - Concept mapping was used to tap the conceptual disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge of 7 biology and 6 geography teachers with short or long teaching experience. The disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge of Ss in both subject areas was unsatisfactory. The 2 types of knowledge did not improve with experience and pedagogical knowledge slightly deteriorated. Ss mastered their disciplinary knowledge better than their pedagogical knowledge. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - The concept map as a research tool: Exploring conceptual change in biology
AN  - 617936503; 1991-19777-001
AB  - Examined the concurrent validity of concept maps as vehicles for documenting and exploring conceptual change in biology. 91 university students enrolled in an elementary science methods course were assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups. Ss completed an inventory that assayed knowledge of life zones in the ocean and then constructed a concept map on the same topic. Ss in the experimental group subsequently received 45 min of computer-assisted instruction on marine life zones; controls received equivalent exposure to an unrelated topic. Upon completing the instructional sequence, Ss again completed the inventory and developed a postinstruction concept map on marine life zones. Experimental Ss showed significant and substantial changes in the complexity and propositional structure of the knowledge base, as revealed in concept maps; no such changes were found in controls.

T1  - The effect of concept mapping on students' anxiety and achievement in biology
AN  - 617932744; 1991-19740-001
AB  - Studied the effects of the metacognitive strategy of concept mapping on anxiety and achievement in biology among 30 boys and 21 girls (aged 14–18 yrs) in Nigeria. Ss in the experimental group became familiar with concept mapping strategy over 3 wks; the controls were introduced to the treatment's science concepts via expository teaching. The Affect Adjective Checklist and a biology achievement test were used in pre- and posttest administrations to measure the treatment effect. Concept mapping was significantly more effective than expository teaching in enhancing learning in biology. In addition, concept mapping reduced anxiety toward the learning of biology, particularly in males. Overall, females had higher anxiety scores that did males. A significant reduction of anxiety was noticed for males. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept maps as a heuristic for science curriculum development: Toward improvement in process and product
AN  - 617932452; 1991-19771-001
AB  - Outlines the use of concept maps as tools for science curriculum development and discusses the changes that occur in the teacher's view of the curriculum with successive revisions of the maps. The maps created by 6th-grade teachers were analyzed using 3 criteria: hierarchical structure, progressive differentiation, and integrative reconciliation. Changes made to the maps during the revision process, including additions and deletions, showed increased clarification of both the concepts to be learned and the connections between them. Consecutive map revisions showed the development of a cohesive conceptual Grade 6 science curriculum. Thus, the use of concept maps can help science teachers develop a science curriculum that is hierarchically arranged, integrated, and conceptually driven.

T1  - Concept mapping brings long-term movement toward meaningful learning
AN  - 618159392; 1992-37052-001
AB  - Investigated the use of concept mapping (CM) as a tool to enhance meaningful learning (ML) in college autotutorial biology students over a 3-instructional unit exposure. 20 students were introduced to CM, and 20 students served as controls. CM appeared to move students slowly toward more meaningful learning. Although this short exposure to mapping, with comparatively small groups, resulted in no statistically significant differences between mappers and controls in measures of initial learning, retention, and learning efficiency, all differences favored the mappers. CM interacted with Scholastic Aptitude Test scores. CM appeared to enhance clarity of learning as supported by 2 error analyses and student claims. CM appeared to enhance integration and retention of knowledge as supported by analysis of cross links, a comparison of student maps with initial and post interviews, and student claims.

AB  - Investigated among 104 9th-graders in 7 science classes the use of concept mapping (CM) and science instructional laboratories. The study measured several student skills and aptitudes and applied aptitude × treatment interactions to investigate interactions between a CM treatment and student aptitudes. The Ss were assigned to control and treatment groups. The treatment groups received instruction in CM and were asked to construct concept maps before and after the completion of a series of laboratory activities. The control group completed the same laboratory activities but did not construct concept maps. All Ss were given a comprehension test after completing the laboratory activities. High ability Ss performing CM achieved lower scores on the comprehension test than did able Ss who did not construct concept maps. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Attaining meaningful learning of concepts in genetics and ecology: An examination of the potency of the concept-mapping technique
AN  - 617791388; 1990-29512-001
AB  - Examined the efficacy of the concept-mapping strategy in 138 students (aged 15 yrs, 8 mo–21 yrs, 7 mo). Ss received instruction in both genetics and ecology: 63 Ss drew concept maps based on these lessons (experimental group) and 75 Ss did not (controls). All Ss were tested for learning in both subjects. Experimental Ss performed significantly better on the test of learning in genetics, and ecology, than their control group counterparts.

T1  - Concept maps and Vee diagrams: Two metacognitive tools to facilitate meaningful learning
AN  - 617883673; 1991-03370-001
AB  - Reviewed research on concept mapping and Vee diagraming from Grade 1 through university. Metacognitive learning occurs whenever a person acquires some general strategy that facilitates learning or understanding of knowledge. Concept maps are a representation of meaning or ideational frameworks specific to a domain of knowledge. Vee diagrams represent the structure of knowledge and the structural elements of new knowledge construction. Skill in using these tools takes time and overcoming ingrained habits of primarily rote-mode learning may be difficult. Rote-mode learning may be responsible for the underrepresentation of women in the sciences since females tend to play the "school game" more conscientiously. When meaningful learning was facilitated by concept maps, student anxiety levels decreased and attitudes improved. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

AB  - Data collected from 138 pre-degree biology students on ecology and genetics show that (1) the 63 Ss in the experimental group who were exposed to the concept-mapping strategy had significantly lower levels of anxiety than the 75 control Ss in ecology and genetics; (2) after treatment, the experimental group of Ss perceived ecology to be less difficult. They also recorded a significantly lower mean score in their perception of the difficulty of genetics when compared with controls. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)

T1  - Concept mapping, Vee mapping, and achievement: Results of a field study with Black high school students
AN  - 617151358; 1986-18484-001
AB  - Studied the effectiveness of 2 specific learning heuristics, concepts mapping and Vee mapping, in helping approximately 242 Black, inner-city, high school students learn biology concepts meaningfully. Instructional treatments that either utilized the 2 experimental heuristics as study aids or utilized outlining as a study aid were compared. The instructional treatments were administered over approximately a 1-semester period. Ss from 2 urban high schools in Indiana took part in the study. Achievement instruments designed to measure meaningful (higher order) learning were developed. It was found that analysis of variance (ANOVA) of the achievement test means failed to reveal significant differences between the experimental and comparison treatment. However, there were suggestions of a tendency toward an effect of the experimental treatment, and several factors (e.g., difficulty of achievement instruments) contributing to the difficulty in distinguishing achievement differences were identified.
