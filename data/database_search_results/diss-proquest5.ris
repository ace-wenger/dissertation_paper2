T1  - Radiation Sciences Students' Perceptions of the Clinical Learning Environment: A Phenomenological Study
AN  - 2895670275
AB  - This dissertation in practice (DIP) examines the perceptions of the clinical learning environment (CLE) from the perspective of students currently or recently enrolled in a radiation sciences program at a midsized, midwestern university. This qualitative study, which followed a hermeneutical phenomenological method, sought to identify suggested improvements for the CLEs of the radiation sciences students to improve their educational experience and perceptions of their learning environment. The literature review examines the lived experiences of radiology students and recent alumni in the CLE (i.e., student education level and perceived clinical skill, teaching strategies of reflection, problem-based learning, concept mapping, layered learning practice model and role modeling as well as clinical climate and feedback) of radiology adjacent disciplines. I used semi-structured interviews to collect data, as well as reviews of reflective journals, subsequently coding and theming these to produce insights about the clinical environment. My findings and analysis identify two major areas for improvement, the toxic climate of the CLE and the lackluster feedback provided on clinical activity. My proposed solutions for improving the clinical climate are to implement servant leadership in place of the current command and control management and use of clinical preceptors in all clinical areas. Solutions for improving the feedback include implementation of a verbal feedback system that happens in real time and improvement to the written comments on the evaluation forms. I detail these solutions and discuss implementation strategies, required resources, and stakeholder involvement.

T1  - Design, Evaluation, Optimization, and Adaptation of a Web Application for Type 1 Diabetes Self-Management
AN  - 2890697721
AB  - Introduction:Self-guided web applications (apps) are one of the digital solutions with the lowest long-term development and maintenance costs that can be used in the field of selfmanagement of chronic health conditions (e.g., type 1 diabetes [T1D]). People living with T1D (PWT1D) are in a constant state of decision-making for glycemic control and to avoid short-term (e.g., hypoglycemia) and long-term (e.g., retinopathy) complications. Providing access to an online tool delivering diabetes self-management education and support (DSME/S) to PWT1D could be beneficial, especially when access to in-person specialized healthcare is challenging. However, a self-guided web app with evidence-based evaluation is lacking. This doctoral project aims to investigate the development of self-guided web apps, specifically in the context of T1D.Methods:A systematic review was performed to understand the development of self-guided web apps for the self-management of chronic health conditions. A self-guided web app for adult PWT1D was then developed with a multi-disciplinary team and tested. A mixed-method registry-based proof-of-concept study was conducted for the web app evaluation. Self-reported questionnaires and semi-structured interviews were used. Data was collected at 6 months (user satisfaction, impact on hypoglycemia, web app engagement) with a follow-up at 12 months and analyzed using paired and independent t-tests and Person correlation tests. Interviews were conducted after 6 months of use (n=16), recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using inductive and deductive thematic approaches. The same web app was then used to explore the needs of youth for diabetes self-management (DSM) in the context of healthcare transition. Purposive sampling was used to recruit 21 youth living with T1D from the registry, social media, and word-of-mouth. After coding the transcribed interviews, themes were grouped using an inductive approach with concept mapping.Results: Results from the systematic review (n=20 publications) demonstrated: 1) an absence of behavior change theory-based self-guided web apps for PWT1D; 2) less than half of the publications (40%, n=8) discussed the acceptability of the features; and 3) inconsistency in the definition of web app adherence. The Support bilingual (English and French) self-guided web app for DSME/S was then developed based on the Behavior Change Wheel and Behaviour Change Techniques. It is accessible from any device with an Internet connection. It is comprised of four learning paths based on the user’s diabetes treatment with six categories of learning modules (e.g., diet and medication) and multiple features (e.g., discussion forum, videos). The web app evaluation was conducted on 207 Support users (mean age 49.2 ± 13.7, 35% men, 96% White). Support received a median [quartile 1; quartile 3] satisfaction of 40 [35;45] (/49). There was a decrease in hypoglycemia frequency and fear at 6 and 12 months; 51% of users reported an increase in confidence in preventing hypoglycemia after using Supportfor 6 months. Features facilitating access (e.g., email newsletters) and personalization of the information (e.g., personalized learning path) are the most appreciated. User engagement was measured by the number of page views related to the content and features, the median [quartile 1; quartile 3] was 54 [24;147] pages during the first 6 months and 0 [0;10] for the following 6 months.Alternate abstract:Introduction :Les applications web sont des outils de santé digitale qui nécessitent un moindre coût de développement et de maintenance à long-terme et qui peuvent être utilisées pour la gestion de conditions de santé chroniques, comme le diabète de type 1 (DT1). Les gens vivant avec le DT1 sont dans un état constant de prise de décision pour la gestion glycémique. Fournir de la formation et du soutien pour la gestion de leur maladie est nécessaire. Il y a toutefois une absence d’application web autoguidée fondée sur des évidences scientifiques. Ce projet vise à investiguer leur développement, en particulier pour le DT1.Méthodes :Une revue systématique d’applications web autoguidées pour l’autogestion des conditions chroniques a été faite. Une application web pour les gens vivant avec le DT1 a été ensuite développée avec une équipe multidisciplinaire et évaluée via une étude de preuve de concept avec approches mixtes. Des adultes du Québec vivant avec le DT1 ont été recrutés via le registre BETTER. Les données sont auto-rapportées via des questionnaires en ligne (0, 6 et 12 mois) et des entrevues semi-structurées à 6 mois. Des analyses descriptives, corrélation de Pearson, tests t indépendants et pairés ont été faits. Les entrevues (n=16) ont été enregistrées, transcrites, codées et analysées avec une méthode thématique inductive et déductive. La même application web été utilisée pour explorer les besoins des jeunes (14 à 24 ans) vivant avec le DT1. Un échantillonnage dirigé a été utilisé pour recruter 21 jeunes pour des entrevues individuelles. Après avoir codé les entrevues, les thèmes ont été regroupés avec la cartographie conceptuelle de façon inductive.Résultats : Les résultats de la revue systématique (20 articles) indiquent: 1) une absence d’applications web autoguidées pour les gens vivant avec le DT1; 2) une faible proportion d’études discutant de l’acceptabilité des fonctionnalités (40%, n=8); 3) une inconsistance dans la définition d’adhésion aux application web. L’application web bilingue (anglais et français) Support a par la suite été développée avec une équipe multidisciplinaire basée sur la Roue de Changement de Comportement et les techniques de changement de comportements. Elle contient quatre parcours d’apprentissage selon le traitement suivi, six catégories d’information (p.ex. diète et médication) et plusieurs fonctionnalités (p.ex. forum de discussion et vidéos). Son évaluation a été réalisée auprès de 207 utilisateurs (l’âge moyen : 49,2 ± 13,7 ans ; 35% homme ; 96% Blancs). Supporta reçu un score de satisfaction de 40/49 [35;45] (médiane [quartile 1; quartile 3]). La fréquence et la peur d’hypoglycémie ont diminué à 6 et à 12 mois; 51% des utilisateurs indiquaient une augmentation de leur confiance à prévenir l’hypoglycémie après 6 mois. Les fonctionnalités facilitant l’accès (p.ex. des courriels pour les bulletins de nouvelles) et la personnalisation de l’information (p.ex. des parcours différents) sont les plus appréciées. L’engagement, en terme de pages vues, était de 54 [24;147] pages pour les 6 premiers mois et de 0 [0;10] pour les 6 mois suivants. Lors des entrevues chez les jeunes, ces derniers avaient un intérêt pour des informations fiables, pratiques et originales à l’application et un accès à du soutien social directement sur l’application.Conclusions : Ce projet contribue au domaine de la santé digitale en présentant le développement d’un outil basé sur les évidences scientifiques, à jour avec l’évolution digitale et en considérant les besoins des utilisateurs. La résultante est Support, une ressource web de formation à l’autogestion du DT1, appréciée par les adultes vivant avec DT1 et qui pourra être adaptée aux besoins des plus jeunes.

T1  - The Impacts of Cooperative Learning Paired With Case Study Teaching Method on Students' Critical Thinking Ability Regarding Issues in Agricultural and Life Sciences at the Collegiate Level
AN  - 2880597029
AB  - Critical thinking skills are crucial for academic success, gaining employment, contributing to the workplace, and everyday life, making the need for critical thinking instruction apparent. However, employers identify critical thinking as a skill currently lacking. The case study method is one teaching methodology that has effectively filled the gap. Areas such as business, health care, law, nursing, social sciences, and others have found that real-life scenarios and situations incorporated into their case study teaching methodology have been particularly effective in developing and utilizing students’ critical thinking skills and abilities. Additionally, there is a strong need to examine how curriculum design changes may be made to ensure that university graduates are either graduating or leaving college and entering the workforce with the ability to perform critical thinking skills successfully, naturally, and in depth.Therefore, this dissertation aimed to determine the impacts of cooperative learning paired with the case study teaching method on students’ critical thinking abilities and depth of ability. Specifically, this study examined the effects of cooperative group learning on students’ critical thinking abilities and depth of ability, as assessed by the QUEEN Model for Assessing Critical Thinking and its five critical thinking behavioral constructs: Questions, Understanding, Evaluation, Explanation, and Neoteric; guided reflection statements; and concept maps. Data were collected from an undergraduate Issues in Agricultural and Life Sciences course in which 42 students participated. This study utilized descriptive statistics and paired-samples t-tests to describe the students’ critical thinking ability. Hedges’ g was used to determine effect size.

T1  - Mitigating Vr Cybersickness Caused by Continuous Joystick Movement
AN  - 2878257239
AB  - When users begin to experience virtual reality (VR) for the first time, they can be met with some degree of motion sickness and nausea, especially if continuous joystick locomotion is used. The symptoms that are induced during these VR experiences fall under the umbrella term cybersickness, and due to these uncomfortable experiences, these users can get a bad first impression and abandon the innovative technology, not able to fully appreciate the convenience and fascinating adventures VR has to offer. As such, this project compares the effects of two cybersickness mitigation methods (Dynamic Field of View (FOV) and Virtual Reference Frame), both against each other and combined, on user-reported cybersickness symptoms to determine the best combination to implement in commercial applications to help create more user-friendly VR experiences. The hypothesis is that combining the FOV reduction and the resting frame methods can mitigate VR cybersickness more effectively without hindering the user’s experience and the virtual nose method is more potent at mitigating cybersickness compared to dynamic FOV. To test these hypotheses, an experimental game was developed for the Meta Quest 2 with five levels: a tutorial level and four maze levels (one for each scenario). The participants were asked to complete the tutorial level until they got used to the virtual reality controls, and then they were instructed to complete the maze level twice with one of the following conditions for each run: no method, dynamic field of view only, virtual nose only, and dynamic field of view and virtual nose combined. After completing each maze trial, the participants were asked to complete a simulator sickness questionnaire to get their thoughts on how much sickness they felt during the test. Upon concluding the testing phase with 36 participants and compiling the data, the results showed that while the subjects preferred the dynamic FOV method even though they were able to complete the trials significantly faster with the virtual nose method, it is inconclusive regarding which method is truly more effective. Furthermore, the results showed that it is also inconclusive if the scenario with both methods enabled is significantly better or worse than either method used separately.

T1  - Art-At-Work: Creativity and Social Practice as Collaborative, Interdisciplinary Research
AN  - 2878257023
AB  - Art-At-Work describes the tools, vocabularies, strategies and experiences that render the emergent spaces of collaborative interdisciplinary research. This body of work generates a story board for the unfolding narrative of a studio-laboratorypractice where artists research with scientists and scientists create with artists. The long-term goals and short-term deliverables of this research focus attention toward the process of building connection, tools and space for future work that creates channels for collaboration among disciplines. With each conversation, concept map, prototype, reflection and iteration, creatives and researchers are exploring the spaces among fields of practice by generating ways of sharing experiences that enrich our academic community and establish connections for future inquiry.Creativity and social practice inform the ways that art has engaged with science throughout this work and as this practice among fields continues to evolve, they will remain critical elements of future collaborations, research and development. The scope of the presented research is immersed in the growing dialogue between art and science and is undertaken with the intention of building capacity for practitioners to generate inter-inquiry agency and investigate the possibilities of working across studios, laboratories and knowledges. Activating different configurations of qualitative insight highlight the role that art can have in the development of transdisciplinary language and methodologies as well as the potential to consider outcomes that are informed by these processes. The findings of this research outline the critical role that time, space and support play in establishing ground for creatives and researchers to engage in the work that builds this new environment. While the disciplines discussed in this research include art and science, collaborative interdisciplinary research is not limited to these domains. Inquiry, creativity and iteration are connective elements among many disciplines and this research will ask readers to consider how innovative we dare to be through growing interdisciplinary collaborative activity by accepting the invitation to practice art at work.

T1  - Interdisciplinary Approach to Understanding Stakeholder Reasoning and Decision-Making for Water
AN  - 2861007078
AB  - On a global scale, humanity is compelled to address complex or ‘wicked’ resource-related issues in the face of accelerating environmental change. In our work, we use the term wicked problem to refer to an issue that has multiple potential solutions and involves various stakeholders. The paths to reach resource sustainability under environmental uncertainty are difficult to identify, plausible outcomes remain uncertain, and tradeoffs required by any path chosen are challenging to understand. Environmental sustainability issues may involve perspectives from multiple stakeholders (i.e., scientists, policymakers, community members, and industry), often leading to conflicting interests and cultural misalignments that trigger the need for a more integrated approach. Participatory modeling (PM) has been identified as an emerging strategy to address these problems. PM aims to generate a shared understanding of the challenges confronting a given resource system through social learning and collaborative thought experiments that explore potential societal responses supported by computational tools. This approach has many examples, but our understanding of how social learning, knowledge shifts, and decision-making occurs in this context remains limited. In this study, we focus on how people understand and collaborate through PM using freshwater supply models of the Middle Rio Grande River Basin. We conducted online workshops with activities targeting key competencies and collaboration, exposing participants to online scientific data and models. Through these workshops, participants identified conflicts, co-created knowledge, and developed potential solutions informed using scientific models. Results of the study allowed us to determine what mechanisms facilitated social learning and the effectiveness of various tools used to present scientific data and models to non-scientists. In this study, we extensively explore stakeholder engagement, participatory modeling, and scenario analysis in the Paso del Norte region's water challenges, utilizing SWIM 2.0. Our research underscores the significance of collaborative processes, knowledge co-creation, and diverse perspectives. The findings highlight participatory methodologies' potential in addressing complex water issues and fostering stakeholder trust. Furthermore, we emphasize the role of group dynamics and negotiations during the collective construction of a group concept map, shedding light on its impact on collaborative success, scenario analysis, and trust-building.

T1  - A Multi-Modal Multiple Descriptive Case Study of Graduate Students’ Statistical Thinking in Statistical Tests Seven Months After Completing a Simulation-Based Introductory Level Course
AN  - 2841249161
AB  - Though statistical testing is commonly practiced, the logic of statistical tests is confusing, thinking about distributions is difficult, and the way statisticians formulate expectations as probability distributions is poorly understood. To support instruction, the statistics education community has increasingly utilized simulation-based pedagogies that place the logic of statistical inference at the core of instruction. Might this approach support and sustain the development of graduate students' statistical thinking, especially during statistical testing? How do graduate students, who have completed a simulation-based course, think while conducting statistical tests, months after completing the course?To answer these questions, a multi-modal multiple descriptive case study of six graduate students in the educational sciences was conducted. Data sources included audio, video, and gaze recordings, analytic memos generated by the researcher, as well as written artifacts generated by the participants. Participants generated concept maps for the logic of statistical tests, conducted statistical tests using statistical software, interpreted results from statistical tests, and participated in a retrospective video-cued interview. Data were analyzed through an interpretivist epistemological stance and employed the constant comparative method to identify relevant moments across all data artifacts to credibly describe participants’ thinking. Results suggest that students’ planning (i.e., deciding what to do and when to do it) was generally quite good. However, students generally struggled in monitoring and evaluating their plan (i.e., ensuring that the plan was being executed correctly, and that no changes to the plan were needed). Furthermore, they generally did not seem to think about null models, core to the logic of statistical testing. Instead, they focused on point and interval estimates for statistics of interest, and primarily thought about sampling variability in terms of a bootstrap dot plot, if at all.This study is one of the first to examine graduate students’ statistical thinking several months after the completion of a simulation-based introductory course. How students were thinking – generally able to reproduce a plan for analyzing the data consistent with what they were taught, and with a focus on variability through the examination of a bootstrap dot plot – suggests that statistics instructors might anchor instruction about statistical tests to descriptive statistics and their interpretation and contextualization. Furthermore, it suggests that the likelihood approach to statistical inference, evaluating hypotheses against given data, may be conceptually easier for students to think about.

T1  - Automating Data Harmonization: Resources and Methods to Improve Harmonization of Clinical Trial and Observational Study Data for Precision Medicine
AN  - 2820269629
AB  - Background: The lack of semantically interoperable, correctly labeled, and annotated health data is potentially one of the greatest obstacles in the implementation of data driven health care. It is estimated that less than 5% of data has been analyzed, due in part to the cost, time, and expertise required to harmonize data across sources when conducting clinical analyses. Harmonizing data for analytics involves (1) mapping variables across datasets, (2) grouping variables representative of analysis concepts, and (3) transforming concept-mapped variables' values to a unified analysis feature. In this dissertation, we developed automatic data harmonization approaches for clinical analyses.Methods: To map variables (step 1), a Bag of Words (BoW) model encoded each variable’s documentation allowing variables to be compared and ranked using cosine similarity. To group variables (step 2), reference variables selected from two study datasets, acting as anchors, were used to select variable pairings from all other datasets. To transform categorical variable values (step 3), encoded values from a BoW weighted embedding model were compared and unified using cosine similarity. Continuous variable values were transformed by applying a z-score to each variable and combining them. 1,658 variables from four cardiovascular observational studies were manually harmonized create a gold-standard for evaluating each of the harmonization steps. Further evaluation included using these approaches in two clinical analysis use cases.Results: Evaluating the variable mapping approach against the gold-standard mappings yielded a precision of 0.95 and F1 of 0.82. Grouping variables by concepts yielded an average precision of 0.95 and F1 of 0.87. Harmonizing values of concept-mapped variables resulted in an average recall of 0.83 for categorical variables and an average concordance index of 0.88 for continuous variables.Impact: This dissertation contributes significant, novel resources for automatic variable harmonization. The approaches developed provide scalable, automatic alternatives to manual data harmonization providing the potential to significantly reduce the time and resources spent on clinical analysis. Additionally, these approaches allow for variable harmonization directly between studies, which provides generalizability and interoperability for non-standardized data or cases when standards are insufficient.

T1  - Effects of Informal STEM Education on Underrepresented Students
AN  - 2806463537
AB  - Informal learning environments are critical to supplemental student learning outside the formal classroom space. The problem the research addressed is the lack of informal STEM learning programs for underrepresented minority, female, urban, and rural students. The purpose of this research was to demonstrate the effect informal STEM learning has on the population’s self-efficacy and interest in STEM. The intervention for this research study was a seven-day informal learning summer camp involving five STEM projects from around the field and aligned with relevant fields offered by the Purdue University Polytechnic Institute. The participants worked in large and small group sessions with program volunteers to gain foundational learning outcomes. The outcome was measured using the STEM-CIS survey instrument in a pre-and post-testing format. The data was coded from the Likert scale and then used to calculate statistics and effect size for Likert-style data. The intervention was performed during the summer of 2021 and yielded results showing that students felt the effect of having role models and professionals involved in the STEM field.

T1  - User Preferences for Hearing Aid Features: Outcomes, Concepts, and Test Construction
AN  - 2890694413
AB  - Modern hearing aids can vary in both digital signal processing (DSP) and non-signal processing (non-DSP) features. The complexity and availability of these features can differ at opposite ends of the technology spectrum, potentially influencing aided benefit and preference. Furthermore, the amount of feature choices in modern hearing aids has led to increasing complexity in the selection process.The first aim of this dissertation was to investigate the aided benefit and preference differences between premium and entry-level hearing aids, and to investigate the drivers of any preference differences. No significant differences were found between the entry-level and premium hearing aids in aided loudness ratings, speech quality, speech recognition, and consonant recognition. However, most participants preferred the premium hearing aids.Investigation of this preference using group concept mapping revealed nine clusters, representing both DSP and non-DSP features. Three clusters were rated as significantly more important by participants that preferred the premium hearing aids. These three clusters represented technologies predominantly found in premium hearing aids (such as remote fitting compatibility).The second aim was to design the Hearing Aid Feature Importance Evaluation (HAFIE) questionnaire. This provides clinicians with a methodology to gather patient feature importance ratings to facilitate hearing aid recommendations.Questionnaire items were designed using concept mapping results as a theoretical framework. Hearing care professional focus groups provided feedback for modification. Validation of the 34-item questionnaire was conducted via Qualtrics. Exploratory factor analysis was used to assess factor structure, resulting in three subscales: “Advanced connectivity & streaming”, “Physical features & usability”, and “Sound quality & intelligibility”. Seven items were removed due to poor factor loading, resulting in a 28-item questionnaire with three subscales. Reliability of each of these subscales was assessed via Cronbach’s alpha and item-total correlation and was found to be appropriate.This thesis has resulted in a conceptual framework of the different aspects of the hearing aid user experience, identifying features which may influence user preference. Furthermore, it has resulted in the development of an evidence-based hearing aid selection tool, providing a structured methodology which may potentially be useful in a clinical setting.

T1  - Voorstad on the Move to Better Health: Evaluation of a Community Health Promotion Programme in a Socioeconomically Deprived City District in the Netherlands
AN  - 2878263584
AB  - IntroductionHealth inequality, a persistent health gap between groups with a higher and a lower socioeconomic status (SES), is a wicked problem caused by multiple factors in the social, physical, and economic environment and the interplay between individuals, groups, and communities. It is broadly acknowledged that more effective strategies to reduce health inequalities should be based on an ecological perspective, addressing factors at multiple levels and looking at the interaction between factors. Nonetheless, up till now, behaviour change approaches have been dominant in health promotion programmes, despite limited effectiveness, particularly in reducing health inequalities.Multilevel strategies, such as a community health promotion approach, based on action principles that align with the Ottawa Charter such as citizen participation and intersectoral collaboration, are promising. As the implementation and evaluation of community health promotion programmes have proved challenging, research is needed that takes into account processes, values, and action principles featuring such programmes. Participatory action research is recommended, as it reflects the values of health promotion, such as participation and empowerment, and it facilitates the development of capacities and learning, thus contributing to health. From July 2016 to December 2019, a community health promotion programme called Voorstad on the Move (VoM) was implemented in a socioeconomically deprived city district in the Netherlands. In line with national and local policy objectives, the programme aimed to contribute to the improvement of health and to find ways to reduce health inequities.AimThe aim of this thesis is to study and understand the impact of a community health promotion programme on health and health-supportive environments on the one hand and the working of the action principles in that programme on the other hand, thereby contributing to finding ways to reduce health inequalities. Four interrelated research questions were formulated:1. How do Voorstad inhabitants perceive health and health-supportive environments?2. What benefits do citizens who participate in the Voorstad on the Move programme observe in terms of perceived health, health literacy, and empowerment?3. What factors and mechanisms contribute to citizen participation and intersectoral collaboration?4. What is the overall impact of the Voorstad on the Move programme in terms of health promotion activities, social and physical environment, and inhabitants’ perceived health?MethodsThe study used a mixed-methods design and combined mainly qualitative data from various sources. The research activities included in-depth interviews, focus group discussions, concept mapping, photovoice, social network analysis, document analysis, and analysis of citizens’ survey data. The use of multiple strategies and multiple research methods across multiple levels was assumed to be the most effective approach. The combination of information from multiple sources and methods – triangulation – increased data validity. Also, partners and citizens were involved in the planning of the research as well as in different research activities. A prominent strategy was action research, which aims to involve all stakeholders, capturing the different perspectives of citizens and professionals and engaging citizens with low SES. It also enables those involved to continually optimise their strategies, and it contributes to developing both theories and research methods to understand and explain what works and why it works.Alternate abstract:IntroductieSociaaleconomische gezondheidsverschillen, de hardnekkige gezondheidskloof tussen groepen met een hoger en een lagere sociaaleconomische status (SES), is een ‘wicked’, of moeilijk oplosbaar probleem, dat veroorzaakt wordt door meerdere factoren in de sociale, fysieke en economische omgeving en de interactie tussen individuen, groepen en gemeenschappen. Het is algemeen erkend dat effectieve strategieën om die gezondheidsverschillen te verkleinen gebaseerd moeten zijn op een sociaalecologisch perspectief en zich moeten richten op meerdere factoren op verschillende niveaus en op de wisselwerking tussen die factoren. Echter, tot op heden zijn gedragsverandering benaderingen en bijbehorende interventies dominant in gezondheidsbevorderingsprogramma’s, ondanks hun beperkte effectiviteit, vooral als het gaat om het verkleinen van gezondheidsverschillen.Veelbelovend zijn multilevel strategieën, zoals een wijkgerichte aanpak van gezondheids‑ bevordering–overeenkomstig de Ottawa charter uit 1986- gebaseerd op actieprincipes als bewonersparticipatie en intersectorale samenwerking. Omdat gebleken is dat zowel de implementatie als de evaluatie van wijkgerichte gezondheidsprogramma’s een uitdaging is, is onderzoek nodig dat rekening houdt met de processen, waarden en actieprincipes die onderdeel uitmaken van zulke programma’s. Hiervoor wordt participatief actieonderzoek aanbevolen, omdat het de waarden van gezondheidsbevordering, zoals participatie en empowerment in zich heeft. Tegelijkertijd faciliteert het de ontwikkeling van vaardigheden en van elkaar leren, wat ook weer bijdraagt aan gezondheid van de betrokkenen.Van juli 2016 tot en met december 2019 is er een wijkgezondheidsprogramma genaamd Voorstad Beweegt (VB) geïmplementeerd in een stadswijk met een lage sociaaleconomische status in Nederland. In aansluiting op landelijke en lokale beleidsdoelstellingen had het programma tot doel bij te dragen aan de verbetering van de gezondheid en manieren te vinden om gezondheidsverschillen te verminderen. In de aanpak stonden de actieprincipes bewonersparticipatie en intersectorale samenwerking centraal. De implementatie van het VB-programma werd vormgegeven en ondersteund door de VB-coalitie, een projectgroep bestaande uit leden van het sociaal wijkteam, de wijkmanager, een opbouwwerker, buurtsportfunctionaris en een gezondheidsmakelaar. De projectleider vanuit de GGD, was tevens actieonderzoeker en schrijver van dit proefschrift.DoelHet doel van de studie die in dit proefschrift is beschreven, is enerzijds de impact van een wijkgezondheidsprogramma op de gezondheid van bewoners en hun omgeving te onderzoeken. Anderzijds was de studie gericht op het bestuderen en begrijpen van de werking van de actieprincipes in dat programma en hiermee bij te dragen aan het vinden van manieren om gezondheidsverschillen te verminderen. Hiertoe zijn vier onderling samenhangende onderzoeksvragen geformuleerd:1. Wat zijn de percepties van inwoners van Voorstad van gezondheid en van een gezondheidsbevorderende omgeving?2. Welke factoren en mechanismen dragen bij aan bewonersparticipatie en intersectorale samenwerking?3. Wat levert deelnemen aan het Voorstad Beweegt-programma bewoners op, in termen van ervaren gezondheid, gezondheidsvaardigheden en empowerment?4. Wat is de overall impact van het programma Voorstad Beweegt in termen van gezondheidsbevorderende activiteiten, sociale en fysieke omgeving en de ervaren gezondheid van inwoners?MethodenIn deze studie is gebruik gemaakt van een mixed-methods-ontwerp en een combinatie van voornamelijk kwalitatieve gegevens uit verschillende bronnen. De onderzoeksactiviteiten bestonden uit diepte-interviews, focusgroepdiscussies, concept mapping, fotovoice, sociale netwerkanalyse, documentanalyse en bewonerssurveys. De combinatie van informatie uit diverse bronnen en methoden – triangulatie – verhoogde de validiteit van gegevens. Samenwerkingspartners en bewoners werden betrokken bij de planning van het onderzoek en bij verschillende onderzoeksactiviteiten.

T1  - Conceptualising the Problematic Nature of Feedback in Higher Education:Mapping the Path to Enabling Student Engagement
AN  - 2877964317
AB  - The aim of this thesis is to provide a framework that integrates the literature on the problems with student feedback engagement with student perspectives to provide an institutional roadmap to effective development of student engagement with feedback. Much of the current feedback research explores individual issues and problems with feedback without considering how these problems impact on each other. There is comparatively little available research on the impacts of institutional structures and policies and their impacts on feedback delivery and engagement, with little appreciation of the interplay between tutor teaching practices, student feedback engagement and what institutions do. Using a three-stage pragmatic mixed methods process, the research sought to identify, from the literature, the problem factors that inhibit assessment feedback engagement in higher education. It then identified the problem factors with feedback engagement from the student point of view. Finally, linkages between each of the eight problem factors identified were considered to conceptualise the interplay between the problem factors. The framework for enabling student development through feedback engagement was developed as the main output of this research. The significance of this study is that the framework presents a multilayered viewpoint on the linkages between the problems with feedback engagement, including student, staff, and institutional factors, giving readers a framework off which to hang future research, staff development, and institutional policies.

T1  - Example-Based Terrain Authoring with Complex Features
AN  - 2838333950
AB  - Synthesis of terrains with complex features has been a challenging problem in computer graphics since most of the existing methods are based on the height field representation. Complex features in terrains adds to the overall realism of the terrain. Hence, there is a need to synthesize terrains in real-time with complex features that adhere to user input. The methodology described in this thesis describes a novel way to synthesize terrains with complex features based on user drawn sketches. Layered stack data structure is used to ensure that the resulting terrain has complex features. Since, Neural Networks are used to generate the terrains, the process is real-time.

T1  - Understanding, Formalizing, and Reconstructing Mental Models with an Online Tool for Serious Discussions
AN  - 2833082612
AB  - We live in a time when humanity faces many existential threats - climate change, resource depletion, biodiversity loss, and refugee crises. Wicked problems need to be properly approached and cannot be solved without human participation, which is hard to organize and support. Participatory modeling (PM) is one method that facilitates stakeholders' engagement in the decision-making process and enables collaboration to achieve a mutually acceptable solution. Mental models are essential tools in PM as they are informal representations of how the world works. The way we perceive, behave, and decide is also influenced by our mental models. Direct observation, learning, and experience can help in maintaining and updating our mental models. At the same time, mental models are constantly relied upon to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict, and explore. Overall mental models play an essential role across all domains of human agency. So, a tool that helps to formalize computer simulations from the mental models expressed by a group within a given problem situation will be of much benefit for practitioners from various fields like behavioural science, economics, education, and sustainability as they can gain many insights. We developed a real-time, moderated tool, named Discussoo, for understanding and formalizing mental models of participants of online discussions. Users are presented with a topic to debate, on which they can express their opinions/thoughts in the form of comments. Users can also respond or expand on other users’ opinions and/or initiate a new line of discussion. The discussion chain is then mined in real-time, using an ensemble of algorithms (including but not limited to concept mining, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis) to extract opinions, keywords, and concepts. This information is transcribed into formal models using Concept maps, Causal Loop Diagrams, and Networks Diagrams as the discussion evolves. To provide feedback, the system presents users with dynamic visualizations of the collective mental model, which they can use as contextual information to refine and update their individual mental models. Targeted moderator comments can also introduce feedback to steer or "nudge" the discussion towards a desirable collective mental model, outcome, consensus, or agreement. Discussoo can be used in a variety of settings and problem situations, where the steering of collective mental models could improve the functioning, resilience, or sustainability of a given system or used by policy makers or any other organization who would benefit from a more direct, transparent and meaningful engagement of their stakeholders.

T1  - Development and Implementation of Integrated Strategy to Inculcate Productive Thinking Among Elementary School Students
AN  - 2817283031
AB  - Productive thinking is a cognitive ability to solve problems creatively. It is a way of thinking that combines creative thinking and critical thinking in an integrated manner. The present study aimed at fostering productive thinking among elementary school students through an integrated strategy. This integrated strategy is the integration of different techniques like brainstorming, concept map, videos and activities with a five step FIESI (Foundation, Ideation, Evaluation, Stabilization, and Implication) model at different phases of this model. Quasi experimental pretest posttest non-equivalent control group design was used. The study was delimited to teaching of Science to standard VIII students of CBSE School in Vadodara city. All the students studying in standard VIII in CBSE School in Gujarat constituted as the population of the present study. Two Kendriya Vidyalayas were selected conveniently from Vadodara city. Students of one section of standard VIII from each of the selected schools were selected as the sample for experimental and control groups. Experimental group was taught science by the researchers through the developed integrated strategy for one academic session (2019-20,) while the control group was taught through their regular science teachers using traditional method of teaching during the same period. Both the groups were made equivalent through a science achievement test. Productive thinking was measured through a productive thinking scale that was prepared by the researchers. Mann Whitney U-test was used to analyze the data. Findings revealed the effectiveness of integrated strategy in fostering productive thinking among elementary school students.

T1  - Applying Retrieval Practice in Climate Change Education: How Retrieval-Based Learning May Enhance High School Students’ Conceptual Understanding on Climate Change Topics
AN  - 2769978007
AB  - This dissertation explored ways to apply retrieval practice strategy on climate change learning at the high school level. Three studies presented that retrieval practice could be used broadly on different topics of climate change and in different learning scenarios. The first study focused on the effect of question placement on learning when students studied sea level rise from an educational video lecture. The results suggested that applying retrieval practice in a style of embedded short-answer questions in videos has clear advantage over restudying the video lecture in both immediate and delayed tests, but no difference in students' performance was found between the two common question embedding practices - dispersed and stacked question styles. The second study expanded the application of retrieval practice by combining it with learner-generated drawing strategy. We explored the effect of retrieval-based sketching method with different levels of retrieval support when students studied the Earth's energy budget from a video lecture. Results did not show any significant difference in students' performance between the "no support", "50% support", and "100% support" drawing conditions on either the immediate or the delayed test. Building on the findings of the second study, the third study focused on the effect of retrieval practice combined with different drawing strategies (concept mapping or sketching) on carbon cycle learning. Results demonstrated that retrieval practice by paragraphing was more beneficial on learning than concept mapping or sketching with open access to the text learning material, or simply restudying the material. However, the results also revealed no difference between the two drawing types on learning, regardless of whether they were implemented with retrieval practice. Generally, retrieval practice could engage learners to deepen the learning processes by reconstructing their knowledge after initial learning. We have demonstrated retrieval practice can be implemented at the high school level to facilitate the learning of various climate science topics.

T1  - Concept Maps for Middle School Computer Science Assessment
AN  - 2766167570
AB  - Concept Mapping has long been used in academic settings for various purposes but has been underutilized for assessment. Creating the concept map task and scoring the maps have been barriers to their widespread acceptance, but these difficulties are mitigated with automation and simple tools for the teacher to use. The aim of this work is to show that concept maps can be used effectively as computer science assessments in secondary schools. Ultimately, they can be used to measure student knowledge and to complement other forms of classroom assessments. We used the Code.org CS Discoveries Units 1-3 Curriculum taught in two newly trained and one veteran computer science teachers' classrooms to demonstrate that a concept map task can be used to achieve similar results to more traditional forms of assessment. The concept maps were collected using a web browser-based program and scored by another computer program using eight different scoring schemes created by the researchers. We compared these scores to assessments created by the teacher and an assessment created by the researchers that aligns with the objectives of the curriculum. The tools and concept map assessment method are appropriate for distance learning, and we found they offer an assessment alternative comparable to, and complementary to, existing methods.

T1  - Culturally Sensitive Delivery of School-Based Services to Salvadorian Immigrant Students: A Comprehensive Review and Analysis of the Literature
AN  - 2763282812
AB  - The purpose of this study was to use a comprehensive review and analysis of the literature to help fill the research gap regarding school-based services for Salvadorian immigrant youth in the United States. Using Bronfenbrenner’s ecological systems theory, journal articles were critically analyzed for the five elements of the ecological subsystems. The study reviewed thirty documents, including research studies, articles, and book chapters under three topics; Salvadorian immigrant youth and families, trauma intervention literature, and cultural competence literature. Content relational concept mapping analysis was used to determine what themes from trauma intervention literature address the unique cultural and historical experiences of Salvadorian immigrant youth. Twenty-one themes were derived from coding Salvadorian specific literature. Most emergent themes were family, Religion, respect for teachers, immigration journey/status/policy, violence, psychoeducation for caregivers, and mental health impacts. All twenty-one themes were found in trauma intervention literature and cultural competence literature with higher instances of coded themes under teachers, psychoeducation for caregivers, mental health impacts, and family themes. Results indicate there are several ways in which trauma intervention literature and cultural competence literature showcases the potential abilities of schools to provide culturally sensitive interventions to Salvadorian immigrant youth and take into consideration the ecological environment in which a Salvadorian immigrant student resides. From the findings, a checklist was created for professionals to inform themselves on Salvadorian history and culture in order to help cultivate meaningful mesosystemic relationships with children and families and tailor interventions to be culturally sensitive.

T1  - Collegiate Sport as Biopolitical Dispositif: Excavating Black Collegiate Athletes’ Educational Experiences
AN  - 2739799640
AB  - In this dissertation, I am chiefly interested in the educational experiences of black collegiate athletes. Throughout the project I build upon previous research investigating the macro-, meso-, and micro-level challenges of United States society that influence the educational opportunities of black collegiate athletes. Specifically, this dissertation aims to interrogate the social, political, cultural, and economic relations within United States society from the period of enslavement up to the contemporary era of exploitation that influences the lived experiences of black bodies and the educational experiences of black collegiate athletes. In the literature review, I work through the intercollegiate sport marketplace and “collegiate sport model” as they developed during the political economic rise of neoliberalism. From there, I give more detail on how the neoliberal logics of collegiate sport complicate the NCAA’s mission of providing a quality education for “student-athletes” and the adverse effect this particularly has on black collegiate athletes. After I bring attention to the historical and contemporary challenges for black athletes, I go on to connect these experiences to broader social, political, and economic institutional issues within the US education system and medical field. To better make sense of how these institutions in United States society, since slavery, have discursively, and materially, constructed the framework from which black athletes derive their subjectivities and educational experiences, in the latter portion of the literature review I use a biopolitical analysis to illustrate the collegiate sport dispositif. In addition to bringing in this biopolitical theoretical approach, in Chapter 3 I explain how I added another component to this line of literature through interviewing black collegiate athletes and having them complete a concept map. Unlike many previous studies, that only utilized interviews, in this study I have 15 black collegiate athletes diagram their experiences through a concept map that allowed me to analyze the interview conversations in addition to the participants’ visual representation. Using this empirical material, I analyzed the position of black collegiate athletes within wider social structures and biopolitical institutions that condition their lived experiences, make them subject, and construct the framework from which they derive their educational experiences. In Chapter 4, I amplify the voices of these 15 black collegiate athletes to articulate their educational experiences as they are positioned within the collegiate sport dispositif. Finally, in Chapter 5, I discuss how the collegiate sport dispositif works to make black collegiate athletes subjects and frame their existence in a way that binds their lives to the exigencies of revenue generation for the collegiate sport marketplace, which leaves them as dehumanized commodities in detrimental educational situations. Lastly, I further discuss how this is intensified in the NIL era and the implications for the future.

T1  - Advancing Equity in Higher Education: The Zone of Proximal Self
AN  - 2734703892
AB  - This dissertation is motivated by a need in the higher education learning sciences field to understand the cultural, social, and emotional processes of student learning and development in advancing equity for students from first-generation, low-income, and marginalized backgrounds. To address this need, I develop and examine a sociocultural conceptual framework called the zone of proximal self. The zone of proximal self is the distance between a learner’s current self and their possible selves which can be bridged through support from institutional figures, resources, and materials across a broad learning ecology in higher education. The structure of this dissertation paper includes the three papers followed by an integrated discussion in the conclusion. In a series of three papers, I use the zone of proximal self as a lens to study college students’ interactions in postsecondary settings during the Covid-19 pandemic. In my first paper, I use mixed methods approaches to analyze survey results from 524 students at a private four-year university to explore first-generation students’ experiences with institutional resources. In my second and third paper, I draw on a study of 50 students at a public four-year university who were asked to meet with a counselor or advisor throughout an academic term and share their experiences through diary entries, surveys, and an interview across a 14-week semester. Results from the first paper reveal how barriers persist for students in interacting with institutional resources; and it reveals the importance of shifting the focus from the role of student meritocracy to that of institutional structures and variability in access to interpersonal and material resources. The second and third paper highlight three pillars of effective practices from counselors and advisors — creating a brave space, validating students, and supporting students’ social-emotional competencies — which are associated with higher growth in students’ professional and personal goals for their possible selves. Taken together, a zone of proximal self lens illuminates how advancing equity in higher education will require humanizing notions of college student success beyond a narrow focus on academic outcomes. The findings which surfaced from an “interpersonal plane of analysis” (Rogoff, 2003) offer design implications for formal and informal learning environments in higher education to incorporate dimensions of humanizing relational practices between students and institutional figures and resources. Moving forward, this work opens up new lines of research to better theorize and assess how humanizing relational practices emerge and foster growth in the zone of proximal self for students from first-generation, low-income, and marginalized backgrounds.

T1  - Resource-Constrained Synchrony: Kuramoto Oscillators Competing for Shared Resources
AN  - 2726433736
AB  - Many systems of biological interest exhibit oscillatory behavior, from the beating of a heart to the firing of neurons to the flashing of fireflies. Further, these oscillatory agents are rarely isolated from one another, and so may interact with one another. In the presence of such interactions, one possible outcome is synchronization of the oscillatory motions. Such synchrony may be observed in the simultaneous flashing of a great many fireflies, or the simultaneous firing of many neurons during an epileptic seizure. A classic model that captures this synchronization is the Kuramoto model. However, the Kuramoto model is a toy model, and thus much work has been directed to extending the model by introducing additional dynamics. In the dissertation, we will present two extensions of the Kuramoto model that make it more appropriate to the study or neural systems. The first extension will add a resource dependence to the Kuramoto dynamics, making the internal dynamics of the oscillators more complex, and thereby introducing novel phases into the Kuramoto phase diagram (Chapter 2). The next extension will allow the oscillators to compete for a shared supply of resources, creating a secondary avenue of communication between the oscillators (Chapter 4). This additional communication pathway will generate correlations in behavior, which may have some relevance for the differences observed between functional and structural connectivity measures in the brain. These two studies serve to elucidate some interesting results on the dynamics of Kuramoto oscillators competing for shared resources, and so serve as my primary contribution to the study of the physics of synchronizable systems. Further, as a scientist-educator, I am also interested in and committed to the education of young physicists, and so I have pursued a separate line of inquiry that studies the learning of students in a cross-disciplinary network-neuroscience course using the tool of concept networks (Chapter 6). We will find that student-drawn concept networks are a useful tool in studying the learning process at a high level, but that more thought needs to be put toward optimizing the collection task in order to bring out the full power of this tool. Collectively, these three studies --- two in the physics of dynamical systems and one in education --- have enabled me to develop in my role as a scientist-educator.

T1  - Making Sense of and Navigating the Stem Vapor: A Qualitative Study of a Single School Community’s Attempts to Understand the Stem Institution
AN  - 2719106122
AB  - Despite its significant role in every level of education, the definition of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics movement, or STEM, has remained elusive, becoming so vaporous as to provide little meaning. As education organizations navigate the STEM institution, they must collectively make sense of its norms, goals, and practices. Yet little is known about this process, including what sense is made, contributing factors, and implications. This paper describes a study guided by relational ethnography conducted in one K-8 school community that investigates how its members make sense of the STEM institution through cycles of interpretation and action. Sensemaking is investigated through interviews, concept maps, and surveys conducted with nine teachers, administrators, and external partners in the community along with analysis of school and external organization documents. Results are organized around three themes: the external nature of STEM, the process of sensemaking, and collective sensemaking in partnerships. First, the tension between the messy, amorphous institution of STEM and the organizational and personal context of teachers, disciplines, school, and community is described. It is proposed that the interpretation of STEM as external to the local context may contribute to a problem of curriculum narrowing, whereby aspects of disciplinary instruction, namely higher-order thinking skills, are also omitted. Second, four key factors influencing sensemaking of STEM are demonstrated: individual frames, disparate messaging from the environment, collaboration, or the lack thereof, and external partnerships. The factors are shown to provide dual obstacles to implementation of STEM as well as to contextual, collective sensemaking about STEM. Third, an investigation of external partnerships provide evidence for the institutions’ messy and inequitable qualities. The paper concludes with a theory that resistance to STEM implementation demonstrated by study participants suggests problems lie not with a lack of clear institutional messages, but with an understanding by teachers that STEM, as presented, has little to do with their practice. Therefore, efforts to use STEM as a vehicle for implementing standards-based practices like higher-order thinking skills may be problematic. The paper concludes with proposals for research understanding the conflict between STEM and contextual, disciplinary practice, including epistemological and structural tensions.

T1  - Concept Maps for Middle School Computer Science Assessment
AN  - 2714114668
AB  - Concept Mapping has long been used in academic settings for various purposes but has been underutilized for assessment. Creating the concept map task and scoring the maps have been barriers to their widespread acceptance, but these difficulties are mitigated with automation and simple tools for the teacher to use. The aim of this work is to show that concept maps can be used effectively as computer science assessments in secondary schools. Ultimately, they can be used to measure student knowledge and to complement other forms of classroom assessments. We used the Code.org CS Discoveries Units 1-3 Curriculum taught in two newly trained and one veteran computer science teachers’ classrooms to demonstrate that a concept map task could be used to achieve similar results to more traditional forms of assessment. The concept maps were collected using a web browser-based program and scored by another computer program using eight different scoring schemes created by the researchers. We compared these scores to assessments created by the teacher and an assessment created by the researchers that aligns with the objectives of the curriculum. The tools and concept map assessment method are appropriate for distance learning, and we found they offer an assessment alternative comparable to and complementary to existing methods.

T1  - Holistic Nursing Process Maps: A Tool for Student Nurses to Operationalize the Nursing Process to Increase Clinical Reasoning
AN  - 2691059754
AB  - Clinical reasoning (CR) has been identified as a required skill for nursing graduates as a part of the broader term of clinical judgment (Benner et al., 2010). The nursing process is a critical thinking framework unique to nursing and designed to support CR. The ability to use CR in nursing is tested in the United States through high-stakes licensure examination. As a response to the high-stakes testing required to enter the profession of nursing, nursing education has sought to identify ways to improve students’ development of CR. The concept map (CM) has been introduced into nursing education as a tool to increase the development of CR. There is abundant research on the efficacy of the CM as a learning tool in many professional fields. Existing literature does not define the key components of the CM or the relationship to the nursing process. There is very little evidence of nursing students’ experiences in using the CM during nursing school. Novice nursing students lack the understanding or expertise to identify the key components of the CM that are essential to their learning. Overlaying the nursing process with a concept map that guides the novice student through the key components of the nursing process will allow the student to operationalize the nursing process and develop essential clinical reasoning skills. Incorporating and developing a student-friendly nursing-specific Holistic Nursing Process Map (HNPM) in nursing education will contribute to the overall improvement of nursing education. The purpose of this study is to introduce an author-developed concept map titled the HNPM to nursing students to identify a correlation between operationalizing the nursing process in the HNPM and the development of clinical reasoning skills in the pre-licensure nursing students’ first semester in the program of medical surgical nursing. Results indicate an inability to conclusively correlate the use of the HNPM and the development of clinical reasoning in the first semester medical surgical nursing student. There was no significant effect for the intervention group in development of clinical reasoning. There were differences in the development of clinical reasoning as measured by the health sciences reasoning test between campuses and between ethnicities, as well as prior healthcare experience without relationship to the use of the HNPM. Future research is recommended with a larger number of participants, increased fidelity of the use of the HNPM, and completion of the health sciences reasoning post-test by addressing identified challenges to increase participation. Qualitative research may be valuable in identifying differences in the development of clinical reasoning among different demographic groups.

T1  - An Ecological Agency Approach to Understanding Student Absenteeism in a Suburban, Kansas School
AN  - 2677599940
AB  - Student absenteeism is a persistent issue in education and is harmful to both the school and the absentee student. One approach to improving student absenteeism is targeting contextual factors within the learning environment. The study uniquely employs an ecological agency approach to understanding absenteeism within the suburban, Kansas school context. The ecological agency theoretical framework explores the person’s personal history, aspirations, and environmental conditions to better understand potential outlets or restrictions to their intended action. Using a case study methodology in a suburban, Kansas school context during the 2020-2021 school year, the study captures the decision-making of four high school absentee students using semi-structured interviews, drawings, and concept maps. The findings reveal that peer socialization opportunities, methods of instruction, shifts in cultural beliefs due to COVID-19, manifestations of anxiety and lack of space to escape their anxiety, social media bullying, and the inability to receive academic tutoring motivated the participants’ daily decision to either attend or miss school during the 2020-2021 school year. The findings provide a basis to improve several institutional and classroom practices. These practices include more student-led instruction and less teacher-led instruction in both in-person and remote learning environments, promoting socialization through classroom collaboration and clubs based on emerging student interests, reducing instances of bullying through prosocial education, safe spaces for students to escape the classroom to manage their anxiety, and more opportunities for one-on-one tutoring to improve grades. The study illustrates an example of using the ecological agency approach to better understand the personal and environmental factors that lead to absenteeism. The study also informs educational policy and classroom practice to better promote student attendance. Further research should investigate other school contexts using the ecological agency theoretical framework to better understand the influence of the school environment and personal contextual factors upon student absenteeism.

This shrinks the fabrication dimensions of these cavities, making field emission cathodes (FECs) an electron source of choice. Photoemission and thermionic sources are increasingly less suited as the complex laser transport schemes and heating source powering these injectors cannot provide the necessary beam quality and may cause damage to the cathode or the injector itself. Carbon-based FECs have dominated the field emission sources R&D portfolio at DOD and DOE for the past 30 years across various high-power vacuum electronic device activities. Compared to traditional metal cathode technology, carbon-based technology cathodes are able to produce higher charge at low electric fields. Small intrinsic electron momentum and simple fabrication means these can become a leading technology, e.g., in the case of carbon nanotubes, nanoscale emitters make them attractive for producing high brightness beams. Specifically, diamond-based cathodes can handle extreme temperature and mechanical stresses that can occur under high gradient conditions.Most promising is a unique form of diamond, ultra-nano-crystalline diamond (UNCD) due to its material and electrical properties, which include being the most conductive form of diamond due to having the largest amount of grain boundaries. This cathode material allows us to explore new frontiers of cathode physics research, revealing a new field emission mechanism that diverges from classical Fowler Nordheim, termed space charge dominated Fowler Nordheim. This form of Fowler Nordheim is space charge dominated but can surpass the 1D Child Langmuir limit and approaches the 2D limit. This is not space charge limited Fowler Nordheim. This ability to decouple the extracted current from the space charge effects allows for the production of extremely bright beams. This can be achieved by expanding the current cathode testing facilities beyond L band into C band so as to access these high fields and explore the temporal dynamics of a field emission source. This will yield the new physics knowledge needed to construct the world’s first custom-built injector specifically designed for field emission sources.Furthermore, exploring other forms of diamond cathode such as Diamond Field Emitter Arrays (DFEA) yields insight into the applications of transversely shaped beams for advanced accelerator applications such as emittance exchange beam lines. DFEA’s allow for the exploration of additional materials effects on the cathode performance such as the ballast resistance. This ultimately allows the derivation of a comprehensive concept map for the field emission dynamic regimes needed for the design of RF injectors. Previously, the theoretical assumption was that everything operated under classical Fowler Nordheim without any additional contributions from other materials properties or beam effects.

T1  - Investigating Game-Based Instruction as a Tool for Engineering Ethics Education in a First-Year Engineering Program
AN  - 2635491831
AB  - Behaving ethically is a core foundation within engineering and is a necessity according to the National Society of Professional Engineers.  Therefore, engineering ethics education has been increasingly encouraged within engineering curriculums in higher education.  Many instructors have found it difficult to teach engineering ethics effectively using traditional strategies such as lectures.  This has caused a trend toward more active learning strategies being researched and utilized within the engineering ethics space.  One strategy that has been growing in popularity in instruction both inside and outside of engineering is game-based learning or using educational games with instruction to accomplish learning goals.  To this end, three games have been created by researchers at Rowan University, University of Connecticut, University of Pittsburgh, and New Jersey Institute of Technology that are designed to aid in the instruction of first-year engineering students around ethical decision making, reasoning, and awareness.  This thesis study explores how first-year engineering students conceptualize engineering ethics prior to formal education and investigates how game-based instruction can be used as an effective, situated and playful learning strategy.  Students were assessed on their ethical knowledge and reasoning through concept map analysis as well as with the moral reasoning instruments, the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT-2) and the Engineering Ethical Reasoning Instrument (EERI).  Student attitudes towards the three games were assessed through responses to a survey.  While there was little to no change in the learning outcomes of the students, it was found that the students were engaged and enjoyed the games.  This study adds to the field of engineering ethics education and spreads the use of different active learning strategies that can be used to improve the quality of instruction.

T1  - The Wrestle for a Holistic Wreality Through Science and Religion: A Science Teacher's Autoethnography
AN  - 2890700152
AB  - I am an experienced science teacher and express my love of science through poetry. This autoethnography digs deeply into the how and why of my life-long wrestle for a holistic wreality that believes that meaning-rich learning is needed in the science classroom. This wrestle led me to several significant personal experiences and to question many assumptions within my ethnographic background, science and religion. It also opened me to the ideas of Rudolf Steiner and Plato and led to the combined holism of Jan Smuts and Wolfgang von Goethe that became the theoretical framework for this autoethnography.As a science teacher, I love the training of disciplined observation and thinking as well as the empowerment implicit in the independent investigation that science offers. Research shows, however, that the materialist, positivist assumptions of Physical Science create conceptual and alienation challenges for many science students and that the use of the arts can help to address some of these. Research also shows that many science Nobel Laureates practice the arts or are religious. My experiences in the science classroom affirm the benefits of artistic and religious meaning-making. This thesis presents my wrestle for a holistic wreality that contextualises objective scientific facts within subjective indigenous and religious knowledge, for a defragmented or holistic understanding and working relationship between them.This thesis introduces the concept of wreality as an individual’s construct of reality and adds to the field of autoethnographic methodology through the development and use of a Concept Map of Autoethnography. It also demonstrates a metaphorical world using Boal’s ‘theatre of the oppressed’ to allow for a creative and liberating framework for my data presentation and analysis.Findings from this research include the Holism Evolution Graph of my holistic wreality which hypothesises the emergence of a new substance into our holistic universe. The nature of this substance and how we may have an experience of it is described in my autoethnography and referenced against religious texts and researched personal experiences. Findings of a personal nature, such as a reflection on the ethnographic worlds of my youth and my possible mild autism, also emerged

T1  - Cleft Lip and/or Palate and Associated Risks in Lower-Middle-Income Countries : A Systematic Review
AN  - 2890699000
AB  - Background: Cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P) is a complex, heterogeneous disorder which occurs due to the interplay between environmental and biological risk factors. Individuals in lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) are exposed to a multitude of risk factors resulting in a greater occurrence of CL/P. Research and knowledge of which risk factors are associated with CL/P in LMICs may aid health care professionals such as speech-language therapists in low-income countries in the early identification of at-risk infants.Objective:To identify and review published data on the risks associated with CL/P in LMICs.Design:A systematic review of literature was performed on electronic databases using the PRISMA-P. Literature on risks associated with CL/P in LMICs, from 2010 to 2020 was included.Results:Seventeen studies met the inclusion criteria. All studies adopted an observational study design. Biological and environmental risks were identified. Maternal and paternal age (n=7) and low socioeconomic status (n=5) were the most prominently associated environmental risk factors. Regarding biological risk factors, a strong association was identified between family history of cleft (n=7) and CL/P occurrence.Conclusion:Environmental risk factors are now being investigated more than biological risk factors in LMICs, hindering health care workers in the early identification (EI) of the possible cumulative effects of risks in CL/P. Contextually-relevant tools are recommended to promote the EI of at-risk infants.

T1  - An Experimental Study of the Effects of a Bayesian Knowledge Tracing Model on Student Perceived Engagement
AN  - 2838332341
AB  - With the advent of Machine Learning and Deep Learning models, many avenues of development have opened. Today, these technologies are being leveraged to perform a wide variety of tasks that were otherwise not possible with traditional systems. The power of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence makes it possible to compute very complicated tasks at near real-time speeds. To provide an example, Machine Learning models are used extensively in the retail industry to predict and analyze critical parameters such as sales, promotions, customer behavior, recommendations, and offers [1].Today, it is increasingly common to observe AI being used across many of the biggest domains such as Health, Environment, Military, and Business. Artificial Intelligence being used in educational settings has thus been a growing field of focus and study. For example, conversational AI being deployed to act as virtual tutors to answer student questions and concerns [2], [3]. Additionally, there is a fill-the-hole type of AIs that will help students learn tasks such as coding by either showing them how to do it or by predicting where the student might go wrong and suggesting preemptive corrective steps [4]–[6].As described, a great deal of literature exists about the use of Deep Learning and Machine Learning models in education. However, the existing tools and models act as external appendages that add to the course structure, thereby altering it. This proposed study introduces a Bayesian Knowledge Transfer model based on the Long Short Term Memory structure (BKT-LSTM) utilized in a live STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) classroom. The model discovers individual student learning profiles based on past quiz performance and customizes future quizzes based on the learned patterns. The BKT-LSTM model works in tandem with the existing course curriculum and only tests those knowledge items that have already been covered in the classroom. The model does not change the course structure but rather aims to improve the student’s learning experience by focusing on areas of the student’s knowledge that require more practice in learning.Within a live STEM classroom, the BKT-LSTM model acts as a herald of change in the way students interact with the curriculum, even though no major changes are observed in the course structure. Students interacting with the model are subjected to quizzes with questions that target the individual student’s lack of learning in particular knowledge areas. Thus, students can be expected to perceive the change as unwelcoming due to the increasing difficulty in subsequent quizzes. Regardless, the study focuses on measuring the learning performance of the students. Do the students learn more in the new system? Another focus of the study is the student’s perception of engagement while interacting with the BKT-LSTM model. The effectiveness of the new educational process is determined not only by increased student learning performance, but also by the student’s perception of engagement while interacting with the model. Are the students enjoying the new experience? Do the students feel like they are learning something? Another important factor was also studied, that is learning performance of students interacting with the BKT-LSTM. This is not covered in the current thesis but is covered in detail in [7].

T1  - Through the Stakeholders' Eyes: An Evaluation of a Transnational Biomedical Research Training Program Advancing the Growing Practice of Global Health Education
AN  - 2665129487
AB  - BackgroundInfluenced by Embrace the World, Pitt’s strategic plan for its global vision the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) has enhanced its involvement in transnational knowledge sharing endeavors over several decades. The School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh has been directly involved in a global health education initiative involving transnational biomedical research training and scientific skills development. The program involves hosting young Chinese medical professionals or Visiting Chinese Medical Professionals (VCMP) from Tsinghua School of Life Sciences, Beijing, China who work alongside members of the “laboratory community.”Statement of Dissertation of PracticeThis dissertation of practice is an evaluation of this transnational biomedical research training program. The program evaluation includes the assessment of stakeholder perspectives to identify program strengths, areas for development, opportunities, barriers, and goals. Identifying these areas helps develop an understanding of the responsiveness of the system to this transnational training program.MethodsPersonal interviews and focus groups combined with secondary data analysis of the Methods and Logic in Biomedicine curriculum, exit interview surveys designed and conducted by personnel from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPSOM), and contractual objectives were used to identify global health education practices in this transnational training program. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and barriers (SWOB) analysis was conducted. Data was coded using NVivo software.ResultsStudy participant groups’ perspectives align and disconnect in program goals, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and barriers. Effort, generation of data, and personal development are identified as main themes in how each group defines productivity. The “laboratory community” is identified as a system supporting this transnational training program. Reported as an area for development is the espoused value of diversity and inclusion.ConclusionsThis transnational training program in biomedical research is a special niche within global health education. The system supporting this program at the University of Pittsburgh has shown adaptability to challenges. Outcomes of this global health education program are the development of scientific skills sets and the evolution of a young physician scientist.

T1  - Effect of Scaffolded Concept Map Format on Chemistry Learning Outcomes
AN  - 2645206562
AB  - While concept maps are a useful instructional tool for learning, the use of concept maps for scaffolding instruction has been less investigated in the literature. This study investigated the effects of scaffolded concept map format compared with non-scaffolded concept map on learning outcomes. Six hundred and fifteen undergraduate students in an introductory chemistry course were randomly assigned to one of the two concept map groups. This classroom-based experimental study used one-way MANCOVA to examine the effect of scaffolded concept maps in promoting learning outcomes. The result showed that the scaffolded concept map group significantly outperformed the non-scaffolded concept map group on multiple-choice knowledge transfer while controlling for the pretest. However, for the free recall response questions, there was no significant difference between the two groups. The implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Integrating Sustainable Education into An Ict Curriculum: A Study into the Role Of 'Technology Stewardship' in Achieving Transformative Learning Toward Sustainability in a Saudi Arabian ICT Training Context for Pre-Service Teachers
AN  - 2637955120
AB  - This qualitative study explores Saudi pre-service teachers’ experience of building understandings of sustainability in an ICT context. It aims to enhance transformative learning toward sustainability through integrating aspects of sustainable education into ICT curricula. It details the epistemic approaches adopted in the research, one oriented around 'technological stewardship', and explores evidence of paradigmatic shifts stemming from that approach. Action research, as seen by Kemmis (2010), with some aspiration of participatory action research, was chosen as a methodological framework, because it allows the active and collective engagement of the pre-service teachers into a learning experience, which enables access to practical data. Through the data collection methods used (Padlet, drawing maps, WhatsApp, focus group and interviews), this study brings new insight into the actual learning practices and the development of technology stewardship processes by pre-service teachers, and how they expand knowledge, perception and practices as related to sustainability.The findings of this study contribute to a growing body of knowledge in the field of sustainable education, transformative learning and technology stewardship. It adds more understanding and develops a rich picture of the technology stewarding processes with regard to sustainable education. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the engagement in a proto-community, and the practicing of technology stewarding, in advancing sustainable education and transformative learning. Through engagement in practices like decision making about relevant resources, negotiating and developing information trajectories, developing relations with others and validating and appreciating different insights, pre-service teachers develop essential skills for sustainable education and transformative learning. These skills include developing learners’ critical thinking, holistic thinking, problem solving skills (knowing), adaptive thinking, integrative thinking (seeing), and collective action skills (doing) (Sterling, 2007). Moreover, the findings suggest that the learners build rich knowledge about sustainability and its relation to technology, and at the same time develop different levels of technology stewarding responsibilities, through gradually engaging in three levels of learning and practice: ‘learning’, ‘leading’, and ‘empowerment’. Eventually, the study suggests a pedagogical framework for designing a transformative learning experience toward sustainability in an ICT context.The above insights might benefit Saudi educational policy makers, revealing possible ways for integrating sustainable education into curricula. Furthermore, it provides practical ways for educators to plan and design a learning experience that could lead to transformative learning toward sustainability. Moreover, it offers a base knowledge for researchers who are interested in studying technology stewardship as a way of enhancing transformative learning toward sustainabilit

T1  - Voluntourism : Can Universities Make a Difference That Lasts a Lifetime?
TT  - <html><head><meta name='ValidationSchema' content='http://www.w3.org/2002/08/xhtml/xhtml1-strict.xsd'/><title></title></head><body>Volunturismo: Podem as Universidades Marcar uma Diferença Que Durará o Resto da Vida?</body></html>
AN  - 2637954594
AB  - The Voluntourism (VT) phenomenon combines volunteering with travelling. Despite the youth segment’s altruism within these social actions, critics question whether their contributions adequately address the local structural concerns. Students’ education as global citizens challenges universities through experiential learning opportunities that enrich the personal and professional self-development while acting towards the community development. However, the comprehension of the universities’ role among the remaining stakeholders in the international context is limited. Hence, the present dissertation intends to clarify how universities can redesign co-creation experiential learning programs to promote a win-win Voluntourism scenario. In this sense, this study explores the stakeholders’ perceptions of the universities’ intermediation in this touristic sector. Based on the conceptual analysis through Leximancer output, results underline the positive influence of these international experiences on universities to align with the students’ expectations and to include communities as part of their mission. These findings advance universities’ opportunity to focus beyond the knowledge transference while accounting for the education on social, cultural and emotional intelligence competencies. Also, when accounting for the interaction with international communities, universities mostly depend on VT operators. Still, this collaboration points out a way for Voluntourism regulation and accreditation by implementing monitoring and evaluation metrics. Thus, the practical and theoretical implications contribute to the literature finding a win-win path to Voluntourism, having universities as a crucial stakeholder.Alternate abstract:O Volunturismo (VT) define o fenómeno de voluntariar enquanto se viaja. Enquanto o segmento jovem vê estes atos como altruístas, vários críticos questionam-se acerca das suas contribuições face aos problemas estruturais a nível local. Como tal, as universidades são desafiadas na educação de cidadãos globais através de oportunidades de aprendizagem-serviço, que visam o autodesenvolvimento pessoal e profissional enquanto auxiliam no desenvolvimento comunitário. Por conseguinte, esta dissertação pretende compreender como poderão as universidades restruturar experiências de co-aprendizagem entre estudantes-voluntários e comunidades locais, de modo a promover um cenário de Volunturismo mutuamente benéfico. Assim, este estudo explorará a perceção dos diversos stakeholders acerca da intermediação das universidades neste setor turístico. De acordo com resultados apresentados pelo Leximancer e a análise conceptual dos mesmos, evidências confirmam a positiva influência destas experiências internacionais, no alinhamento com as expectativas dos estudantes e na inclusão das comunidades como parte fulcral da sua missão. Paralelamente, as universidades deverão expandir o foco central da partilha de conhecimento, na educação e desenvolvimento de competências sociais, culturais e de inteligência emocional. Contudo, dada a componente internacional, o desempenho das universidades na interação comunitária depende da parceria com os operadores de VT. Porém, esta poderá ser vista como uma oportunidade à regulação e acreditação do Volunturismo, perante a implementação de métricas de monitorização e avaliação. Por último, as implicações práticas e teóricas visam contribuir para a literatura, ao proporcionar uma melhor compreensão de como recriar um cenário de melhores práticas no Volunturismo, através da influência académica.

T1  - Evaluation of a New SCDNR Education Program, King Tides: Flooding the Lowcountry with Plastic
AN  - 2629790446
AB  - The South Carolina Department of Natural Resources (SCDNR) and the ACE Basin National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR) conduct marine education programs for K-12 students throughout the Lowcountry. Most interventions occur on one day lasting 2-4 hours. There are currently two multi-day programs at SCDNR entitled Climate Stewards and From Seeds to Shoreline. For this project, a new multi-day program was developed and evaluated. This program teaches students about the connections between king tides, high tide flooding, and marine debris in the Lowcountry. Students participated in two in-class lessons about the concepts and a field trip. Students’ attitude change was evaluated using attitude survey questions and a 3-2-1 Bridge activity (Project Zero). Concept maps were used to gauge students’ overall knowledge and ability to connect the topics after completion of the program. Concept maps were scored using a rubric developed by Novak and Gowin (1984). Results from this study indicate a well-developed or developing understanding of the concepts in 58.5% of students and an overall increase in mean attitude scores. Evaluation of this program can be used to improve the program for future use and gain a better understanding of how students learn and connect knowledge gained during SCDNR programs.

T1  - Measuring Model-Based Learning of Complex Systems with Multiple Data Streams
AN  - 2616240375
AB  - The dissertation builds on my current research to demonstrate the connection between affect and learning through machine learning and qualitative analysis of interactions where players use a complex systems game. The project is threefold: First, I developed a thinking and learning intervention, the agent-based modeling simulation Ant Adaptation. I showed that the intervention can shift people's schemas from a process schema to an emergent schema during 10-minute museum interactions. Second, to track that conceptual change common in agent-based modeling interventions, I developed a novel form of concept mapping, constructivist dialogue mapping (CDM), which is particularly useful as a learning analytic. Through CDM, I analyzed participants’ spoken elaborations in small subsets to study how people develop their understanding of a system or museum exhibit over time. Third, through video analysis, I developed a method of affect detection to identify how participants are engaged across 17 facial action units. I map those affective-states to moments of learning using machine learning methods. Because the data source is video, the method has outsized potential for scale to predict unseen data. In short, in my work I have applied advanced methods to the design and evaluation of educational interventions.

T1  - Comparative Investigation of Full and Focused Network Feedback on Students’ Knowledge Structure and Learning
AN  - 2604884220
AB  - STEM education has an important role in students’ learning, and one of the challenges in learning STEM is students’ conceptual understanding during the learning process. For example, in many engineering courses, the instructors often employ methods which are predominantly limited to “chalk and talk”. This type of hands-off teaching method discourages students’ engagement with the topic; therefore, many students’ understandings of it are at the surface level. Summary writing is an effective approach for helping learners to integrate and understand the STEM content. In this investigation, the tool Graphical Interface of Knowledge Structure (GIKS) asked students to write a summary essay of lesson content. Next/ Following this, GIKS generated a network map as feedback of the term-term association, which allowed students to reflect on their essay content and structure. This also allowed the instructor to review the essay results simultaneously.In this investigation, knowledge structure referred to an individual’s cognitive structure. In the prior pertinent literature, it was also referred to as individual’s structural knowledge, conceptual network, conceptual representation, conceptual structure, knowledge organization, and semantic structure. Network maps provided a way to understand knowledge structure and could show the transition of knowledge from novice to expert.Network feedback could serve as a form of structural feedback, a form of feedback that directly intended to alter the structure of term-term associations. This research focused on two types of network feedback: Full network feedback and Focused network feedback. Full network feedback referred to the ordinary view of domain content, while in contrast the Focused network feedback allowed a closer look at a few key sub-branches or specific areas of this content. Ultimately, the Full network map provided the broader understanding of the content knowledge, whereas the Focused network map emphasized the most central and important information. Thus, the difference between Full network map and Focused network map depended on whether the Focus located on the overall domain or a key sub-branch of the content.The research questions in this dissertation included:• Which network feedback leads to a better novice/student’s learning performance?• Will students use and value this approach?• What is the influence of students’ achievement goal orientation in this structural feedback approach?In order to investigate and respond to the research questions, the learning performance of students in an engineering course using GIKS, who were randomly assigned to receive either Full network feedback or Focused network feedback, were compared. The control group was Full network feedback and the experimental group was the Focused network feedback. Participants’ knowledge structure was measured at three times. Findings indicated that Focused network feedback relative to Full network feedback had a significant impact on individual’s knowledge structure (KS) improvement in 45 days after the treatment.

T1  - The Co-Development of a School-Based Nutrition Intervention to Prevent Childhood Obesity in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia
AN  - 2593869086
AB  - Background: Childhood obesity is a major public health issue in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC) and effective prevention initiatives are much needed. This study aimed to co-develop, with stakeholders, a school-based intervention for obesity prevention among adolescent girls in Jeddah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A social-ecological framework and co-development and participatory approaches were used to understand the drivers of adolescent obesity in KSA and to develop and assess the acceptability of the co-developed intervention. Design and Methods: The PhD programme of research was conducted over three phases. Ethical approval was obtained from the Ministry of Education (MoE) in KSA and also from King's College London Research Ethics Committee (REC number: 3727). Phase 1: focused on evidence building to understand the burden of adolescent overweight and obesity in KSA and other GCC countries. Phase 2: focused on partnership building, co-identifying intervention priorities and co-developing intervention content and mode of delivery using a participatory approach. Specifically, during this phase, I examined school readiness using a 17-item questionnaire which assessed the school environment, policies and practices related to diet and physical activity, and the capacity of the school to promote the intervention. Also, I assessed students health behaviours (N=100 per school) using a 22-item health behaviour questionnaire. Group concept mapping was used to obtain adult and students stakeholder perspectives on important and feasible intervention opportunities for obesity prevention in two secondary schools. Photovoice was integrated into the concept mapping with students. Adult stakeholders included staff from the Ministry of Education (MoE) and schools, school canteen suppliers and mothers (N=19). Student stakeholders (N=15) were from two girls' schools (one secondary, ages 13-15 years and one high school, ages 16-18 years) that were purposefully identified with the support of the Ministry of Education. Both stakeholder groups identified a school-canteen based intervention as an important and feasible intervention. Prior to intervention development, an evidence synthesis on school canteen interventions was undertaken to understand the impact as well as the enablers and barriers associated with such interventions. Phase 3: focused on further developing the ideas for a school-based canteen intervention and on small scale piloting. Firstly, intervention modelling workshops were conducted with stakeholders (10 students, 11 MoE and school staff) drawn from Phase 2 to identify the content and mode of delivery of the canteen intervention. Students also conducted canteen food-scaping to identify current provisions and assess healthfulness. Semi-structured questionnaires during workshops were used to identify common themes related to school food provision. The nutrient profile of existing and intervention food and drinks in both school canteens was assessed using the Food Safety Authority traffic light system for nutrient quality where red indicates high (unhealthy), amber (moderate) and green (healthy). Next, a two-day uncontrolled pilot was conducted in both schools. Two classes from each school were randomly selected (N=116 - 60 secondary school students aged 13-15 years; 56 high school students aged 16-18 years). The intervention canteen provisions were provided by the existing food suppliers and aligned with both the students' preferences and the MoE guidelines for canteen food provision. Pre-post intervention assessment of the small-scale pilot was undertaken using a 20-item questionnaire. All consultations/ surveys were conducted by MA in Arabic, orally and/or in print. Data were then translated into English by MA for analysis and reporting. Results: Phase 1: In the KSA, there was an increase in the prevalence of both overweight and obesity in the 2000s. The 2011 national survey gives the most recent estimates with about 1 in 3 boys and 1 in 4 girls aged 12-18 years old being overweight or obese. In Kuwait and the UAE, the levels of overweight declined whilst that of obesity increased. The levels were highest in Kuwait, with obesity levels of 37% for boys and 25% for girls aged 6-18 years in 2013. Qatar had the lowest rates with obesity level of 5% for boys and girls aged 6-18 years old in 2010. Across all GCC countries, poor dietary habits and low levels of physical activity were associated with overweight and obesity. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was higher in those with higher socio-economic circumstances (SEC) compared with those in lower SEC groups. Only one school-based intervention study in the GCC was identified and the study quality was poor. Phase 2: a) The readiness assessment of the school reflected a nutrition-poor environment. Access to healthy food was reported by the school staff but researcher observations found that canteen foods were nutritionally poor. The foods available were mainly highly processed and high in fat and salt, including croissants and pizza. There was a lack of facilities to prepare food in the canteen. A poor level of priority and support for physical activity was reported in addition to poor access to outdoor play areas, sporting equipment and facilities for outdoor games. The adolescents' health behaviour assessments (response rate 95%) found that 29% of mothers and 48% of fathers were educated to degree level, and 16% of mothers and 67% of fathers worked in full-time employment. Poor dietary habits (37% had daily breakfast, < 5% consumed ≥ 5 portions of fruits and vegetables per day and high sedentariness (90%) were reported among students. b) 6 workshops (3 workshops with 15 students; 3 workshops with 19 adult stakeholders) were undertaken with stakeholders. Concept mapping identified a school-based intervention as the most feasible and actionable intervention for this context. There was correspondence across stakeholder groups, adults and students, in several areas including a strong emphasis on improving access to healthy, affordable foods in the canteen. The meta-analysis from the review of the school canteen interventions showed a positive, though small, impact on total energy intake (pooled mean difference between intervention and control group -32.49 kcal/day, 95% Confidence Interval -48.22 to -16.76), and on fruit, vegetable and fibre (+0.97 g/day, +0.51 to +1.44). Phase 3: intervention modelling workshops with both students and adults identified improved canteen provisions, specifically more healthful and reasonably priced foods. Teachers emphasised that healthy food would promote better academic performance; the Ministry of Education was insistent that the new additions of food and drink must align with school food policies and students wanted their food preferences reflected and an improvement in nutritional quality compared with the existing canteen foods. Pre-intervention, the nutrient profile of existing food and drinks in both school canteens was poor with a high proportion of the items being coded as 'red' (high levels of fat, saturated fat, sugar or salt). The intervention items had a significantly more healthful nutrient profile, with a high proportion of items being coded as 'green'. For example, snacks such as Kinder and Twix chocolate bars were replaced with fruit salad (banana, kiwi, apple, grapes, strawberry, cantaloupe melon). The intervention was a non-controlled pilot study and was conducted in both schools across two days among 116 students, with 69% of participants completing the pilot assessment pre- and post-intervention questionnaires. During the pilot intervention, all canteen provisions were consumed and post-intervention acceptability and overall satisfaction was reported for intervention foods (6% pre-intervention vs 34% post-intervention, p=0.001) and drinks (11% vs 32%, p= 0.011). Conclusions: Using a social-ecological framework and participatory approaches throughout the research process, an acceptable school-based canteen intervention was co-developed with students, school and MoE staff. The intervention was tested successfully during a pilot study and has potential for a larger evaluation study. Some key issues that need consideration in future larger scale work include improved parental engagement, intervention timing so that examination periods are avoided, and development of a framework for cost-effectiveness in the context of complicated canteen provision arrangements. The co-development approach was an effective method for engaging students and adults in intervention design and evaluation and should also be considered for future research in this context.

T1  - Un-dam the River? Public Opinion and Engagement with Issues of Dam Removal in New England
AN  - 2583999259
AB  - Complex interactions between society, ecology, and the economy have revealed a particularly challenging set of problems in the context of sustainability and sustainable development. Such problems are “wicked” in nature due to their high degree of uncertainty, lack of a shared definition, competing values, complex social-technical interactions, as well as the often contradictory institutional and procedural governmental regulations and frameworks. Such multi-issue, multi-party problems are prevalent in management of social-ecological systems, particularly those surrounding decisions about water resources—given that such problems cannot be tackled via a single discipline, scientists have called for production of new knowledge that informs policy making and advances societal needs. Sustainability science is a new frontier which can help organically integrate science, engineering, and planning, and ultimately support production of actionable science that helps find solutions to urgent human needs, inform long-term planning, and impact policy making at the intersection of human well-being and the protection of the planet’s life support systems. A sustainability science framework is useful for tackling problem-solving around “wicked” water resource management issues, such as decisions about dams.New England, as much the rest of the world, has been subject to vast landscape alteration and ecological degradation over the past several hundred years. While some view dams as symbols of human ingenuity, others see them as symbols of colonization and environmental degradation. Given that thousands of these dams are reaching the end of their lifespan and pose safety risks, they present unique river restoration opportunities. However, alternative management decisions about dams, such as removal, are associated with various costs and benefits, or tradeoffs. As stakeholders are faced with decisions regarding the fate of aging dams in their communities, they are often confronted with contentious and polarizing arguments about what should be done with a particular dam. Stakeholders’ conflicting interests within the context of the social, ecological, and engineering complexities surrounding dams, often lead to unsuccessful negotiations that make it challenging to make progress toward shared sustainability goals.This dissertation seeks to improve the current decision-making landscape about dams, and the hard-bargaining negotiation practices that often surround them, by bridging the science-policy divide via 1) addressing knowledge gaps about public and stakeholder perspectives, and 2) advancing collaborative decision-making theory and practice via design, implementation, and evaluation of a science-based role-play negotiation simulation, a novel process of knowledge production tested with stakeholders in New England. The dissertation structure is further organized into three distinct studies. Study 1 explores public opinion surrounding dams in New Hampshire within the context of four tradeoffs—findings reveal that the majority of respondents favor removing dams as opposed to keeping them for preservation of industrial history, property values, or flatwater recreation. Respondents favor keeping dams, however, if they are to be used for electricity generation via hydropower. Additionally, Study 1 results show that younger respondents, women, and liberal-leaning respondents are more likely to support dam removal, although this varies depending on the tradeoff.The focus of Study 2 was to develop a stakeholder assessment for the state of New Hampshire to inform whether and how fostering a collaborative decision-making process is possible. Specific objectives for Study 2 were to identify 1) the stakeholder groups, priority interests, issues, and decision-making constraints, and 2) barriers and opportunities to fostering collaboration and desired project outcomes. Results from Study 2 reveal that stakeholders are open to collaborating and reimagining the decision-making landscape around dams, but need to overcome substantive and process-related barriers by focusing on opportunities around transparent and participatory decision-making, diversity of public participation platforms and modes of engagement, trust in science and among stakeholders, effective science communication, competent technical consultants, funding availability, and joint fact-finding.Study 3 examined the extent to which science-based role-play negotiation simulations impact learning, use of science in decision-making, and innovative problem-solving around management of dams in New England. As part of this study, stakeholders engaged in a mock decision-making process (reflecting real-life institutional arrangements and scientific knowledge) for a set period. Tradeoffs between hydropower, fish passage, costs, cultural/historic benefits, recreation, and property values were at the center of this negotiation simulation. By playing an assigned role (different from the participant’s real-life role) while interacting with a computational model across a series of workshops in New Hampshire and Rhode Island, participants had a safe space to learn about each other’s perspectives, develop shared understanding about a complex issue, and collaborate on solving that issue. The role-play was evaluated using data from a mixture of questionnaires, interviews, concept mapping activities, and debriefing sessions. Results from Study 3 indicate that science-based role-plays lead to shifts in cognitive, normative, and relational learning. Results also reveal that stakeholders view immersive knowledge production processes, such as these role-plays, as salient and legitimate products (however, not without some criticism), suggesting that such products can contribute toward bridging the science-to-policy divide in issues surrounding dams. In summary, this dissertation uses mixed-methods to carry out applied, problem-oriented, solutions-driven, and user-inspired research that contributes toward the advancement of theory and practice of sustainability science, while helping address disciplinary gaps and shape decision-making around dams in New England and beyond.

T1  - Incivility of Coworker Behaviors and Minority Firefighters’ Belongingness in the Workplace
AN  - 2583928050
AB  - Research with firefighters continues to indicate that this population is particularly vulnerable to development of mental health conditions as a result of their professional roles (International Association of Firefighters [IAFF], 2019; Stanley et al., 2017; Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration [SAMHSA], 2018) and minority firefighters may be at heightened risk as a result of their experiences within the fire service. An answer to this concern may lie in the exploration of belonging and uncivil behaviors, as research has demonstrated that belonging in the workplace serves to reduce mental health symptoms and enhance an individual’s ability to cope with stressors and workplace trauma (Cockshaw & Shochet, 2010; Shakespeare-Finch & Daley, 2017), while uncivil behaviors have been linked to decreased work performance and detriments to mental health (Kunkel & Davidson, 2014; Porath, Foulk, et al., 2015; Porath & Gerbasi, 2015; Porath, Gerbasi, et al., 2015; Porath & Pearson, 2012). Therefore, to better understand minority firefighters’ experiences with uncivil coworker behaviors that influenced their sense of belonging in their workplace, I used Concept Mapping design (CM; Kane & Trochim, 2007). Ten firefighters that self-identified as racial minorities generated 73 statements describing behaviors that decreased their feelings of belonging. These statements were organized into four regions encompassing seven clusters. I discussed findings of the current study with implications for mental health professionals’ treatment of firefighters,counselor education, and the fire service as a whole as well as the limitations to the study and suggestions for future research.

T1  - “Without Failure, It’s Just Not Research”: Investigating Undergraduate Students’ Experiences of Scientific Failure in Research Settings
AN  - 2572537708
AB  - Failure seems to have various meanings and manifestations in diverse contexts. Students hope to avoid failure because of the potential consequences towards their aspirations, yet scientists speak of failure as a typical part of the scientific experience. Because of its consequential impact for students, particularly for undergraduate STEM attrition, the experience of failure needs to be better understood in its different contexts. Situated learning experiences like undergraduate research offer students the opportunity to learn through participation in the scientific community of practice. This dissertation explores how undergraduate students define and understand the experience of scientific failure in the context of natural sciences research settings. Students were recruited through surveys to undergraduate researchers, where respondents could opt to participate in an interview. The study was guided by hermeneutic methodology. Hermeneutic analysis revealed that students saw failure as particular outcomes, responses, or as a process. These were not mutually exclusive definitions as students sustained multiple conceptions of failure simultaneously. Students also rationalized failure methodically, by admitting their inexperience in the research setting, experiencing some emotional distress, recognizing specific skills for managing failure, and finding an opportunity for learning. Students responded to failure with begrudging acceptance, based on their perception of failure as a part of the scientific process. Hermeneutic analysis through the community of practice (CoP) framework demonstrated that scientific failure could involve student participation within the facets of (1) domain through epistemic engagement, (2) membership through mentorship, and (3) practice through critical reflection of the process. This work supports arguments for allowing broader participation of students in undergraduate research and highlights the key role of mentorship in these spaces in facilitating students’ sense-making of the failure experience. While this work cannot make any conclusions about students’ experiences of failure in the undergraduate science classroom settings, it establishes that this meaning-making experience can be valuable to students as a means of achieving a science epistemology. Translating this learning into the classroom will require investigating how metacognitive training utilizes reflection as an epistemic practice and how students’ identities impact their perception and experience of failure.

T1  - Validation of a Survey Instrument: Team Creativity and Innovation (C/I) Processes as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS)
AN  - 2559465995
AB  - Companies are becoming increasingly dependent on teams to drive creativity and innovation, which usually involves multiple teams working together to solve complex problems However, the first problem is that work teams do not always manage creativity and innovation well, especially when partnering with other work teams on highly complex projects that demand greater interdependence and collaboration, which can constitute as much as 90% of today’s organizational projects. The second problem is that researchers struggle to define and measure creativity and innovation for the past decade resulting in significant variation both within and between creativity and innovation scales that have restricted meaningful theoretical discoveries and advances. The current study is significant because it introduces a novel instrument derived by John Turner that measures team creativity and innovation processes as a single unit, thereby raising the level of theoretical sophistication and leading to better practical applications. After conducting factor analysis, the current study validates six factors, including 36 indicators, and measures team creativity and innovation processes as complex adaptive systems (CAS). The current study recommends deploying the new instrument in other sectors beyond the IT sector and using multilevel techniques that include the individual and executive/organization levels of analysis.

T1  - Understanding Medication Self-Management in Community-Dwelling Adults with Chronic Medication Experience: An Exploratory Concept Mapping Study
AN  - 2556428579
AB  - Existing medication self-management frameworks are primarily adherence-focused and often do not consider physiological, psychological, and sociocultural factors that affect medication experiences. Thus, this study explored what Canadian adults with chronic medication experiences can contribute to our understanding of medication self-management. Using concept mapping, nine thematic clusters were identified on what matters to individuals about their medications: 1) researching and becoming educated about medications; 2) social support; 3) effectiveness of medication; 4) self-ownership of medication; 5) ease of use; 6) convenience and accessibility; 7) information provided by health care provider; 8) personal interactions with health care provider; and 9) patient involvement and trust. Statements within these clusters were generally rated highly on both importance and feasibility, regardless of participant characteristics. Themes generated by participants complement and extend current conceptualizations of self-management by including medication-specific priorities.

T1  - An Examination of Preschool Teachers' Beliefs about Early Literacy within the Context of a Transdisciplinary Neuroeducation Learning Framework: An Exploratory Qualitative Case Study
AN  - 2544484851
AB  - Teacher beliefs have been shown to be an influential factor in student outcomes in all areas of learning. In light of the persistent achievement gap between White students and students of color, it seems important to study and understand the role of teacher beliefs in public education. This exploratory case study contributes to a deeper understanding of how preschool teachers’ beliefs about early literacy are expressed or may evolve within a context of implementing the Neuro-semantic Language Learning Theory, a learning framework integrating neuroscience, Western cognitive psychology, and language acquisition into educational applications. The study design included a sample of three preschool educators and multiple data collection events using a robust variety of elicitation methods, including concept map construction, video-stimulated recall, and semi-structured interviews. The data were analyzed following Saldaña’s first, second, and third cycle coding methods and employed both deductive and inductive approaches. Findings included broader definitions of early literacy by study participants than are noted in the literature and the belief that meaningful learning requires context within social interactions as opposed to skill-based interventions. The most significant finding highlighted the complex and contextualized nature of teacher beliefs, which may be changed through the insertion of cognitive disequilibrium supported by a complex and contextualized system of theoretical translation, professional learning opportunities, ongoing coaching, and believable vicarious experiences. Specific recommendations for professional learning experiences and future research are offered.

T1  - Exploring Students' Experiences of Concept-Based Learning in an Asynchronous Online Pharmacology Course: An Interpretive Study
AN  - 2543761525
AB  - The intent of this interpretive study was to explore students’ experiences of using a concept-based approach to learning, understanding, and applying pharmacology concepts in an asynchronous online pharmacology course and how students demonstrate meaningful learning of pharmacology using unfolding case studies in an online classroom.  Varied teaching approaches, difficulty with drug nomenclature, and the sheer number of medications on the market make it difficult to prepare students for safe medication administration.  Using a concept-based approach to teaching pharmacology may help to manage the amount of content students receive and improve clinical judgment and clinical reasoning skills that can be applied in the clinical setting. The main sources of data for this study were participant concept-maps, unfolding case studies, and reflective journals. Meaningful learning was determined by participant’s ability to apply pharmacology concepts in a real-world context. This study found that some participants had gaps in knowledge with regards to pathophysiology. Concept-mapping and case study assignments made these knowledge gaps apparent and created teaching moments. Concept-based structure in the asynchronous online classroom helped participants to think in a logical manner and improved clinical reasoning and clinical judgment.

T1  - Conversational Pattern Mining Using Motif Detection
AN  - 2890698827
AB  - Conversational mining has become a subject of great interest due to the explosion of the consumption and generation of social and other related online media. Supplementing this is the advancement in pre-trained language models, and other embedding techniques which have helped us to leverage these important sources of information. Conversation is an interesting domain to analyze in terms of its complexity and value in society. Complexity arises because a conversation can be asynchronous and can involve multiple parties. Additionally, it is computationally intensive to process. A lot of value can be derived from mining conversations, particularly in goal-oriented domains. We use unsupervised methods in our work in order to develop a conversational pattern mining technique. This negates time consuming, knowledge demanding and resource intensive labeling exercises. The aim of our work is to extract short segments of repeating ideas in conversations, also known as motifs. This can be useful for searching for particular conversational cues as well as clustering, understanding and characterizing sets of conversations. The task of identifying repeating patterns in sequences is well researched in the eld of Bioinformatics. In our work, we adapt this to the eld of Natural Language Processing and make several extensions to a motif detection algorithm. We split the work into two major parts. The rst is sequence creation, which entails converting sequences of text (conversations) into meaningful numeric sequences. The second is the emphasis of the work, whereby we focus on the explanation of the motif detection algorithm, its adaptation and extension. In this research, we use used the Gibbs Sampling algorithm. In order to use this algorithm in a language setting, we modify the algorithm to cater for vector-valued sequences. These sequences are representations of conversations. They are constructed by grouping phrase-level embeddings via a community detection algorithm on a graph, in which relationships between phrases are edge weights. These groups of phrases form logical phrase abstractions which we call phrase classes. In order to use phrase classes as a base for the motif-detection algorithm, we reduced the phrase class dimension using the UMAP algorithm. We demonstrated the application of the algorithm on a dynamic, real world open-source lm script data set. In this study we ran an exploratory investigation into the types of motifs we were able to mine.

T1  - Development of a Building Information Modelling Asset (Bimasset) Value Realisation Model
AN  - 2734702845
AB  - Building Information Modelling (BIM) is defined as a set of interacting processes, people and technologies that produce a methodology to digitally manage the data of a building, its performance, planning, construction, and later its operation. Although the business value of BIM has been observed during the design and construction processes, research efforts made towards documenting BIM business value when considering an asset’s lifecycle are insufficient. This PhD study is based on a three-part rationale: the lack of perceived business value of BIM; weakness in BIM business value measurement techniques; and barriers of BIM implementation in the lifecycle of assets. The aim of this research is to extend the knowledge base in relation to BIM business value realisation and BIM adoption in Asset Management (AM) by developing a model that will help to guide asset owners in realising business value of BIM implementation in an AM system throughout the lifecycle of built assets. Furthermore, the scope of the study is limited to the following: client as an asset owner; asset operations in relation to AM lifecycle; and BIM implementation during asset operations.The BIMAsset Value Realisation Model (BIMAsset VRM) is developed abductively from five sequential studies (Chapters 4-8). The BIMAsset VRM consists of six constituent elements; Influencers, Input, Output, Drivers (tangible and intangible value), Core and Business Value Realisation Dimension. Data obtained for this study is qualitative. Semi-structured interviews are used to collect data from 16 participants in 18 interviews in 6 case studies. Furthermore, documented data is sourced from these case studies in order to add depth to the study data. Data is collected in the UK, Finland, Denmark and the USA. These cases represent retail, government, health, education and consultant perspectives in AM. Data collected were analysed using mixed methods. Thematic analysis, content analysis, theoretical saturation and descriptive statistics are utilised in analysing and presenting the results of this study. The study utilised a six-member expert panel in the form of a focus group to validate the BIMAsset VRM. It is validated through expert opinion against pre-determined criteria of fruitfulness, prudence, quantification, scope, progressiveness, internal consistency and external consistency. The results of the focus group show that there is a majority opinion that the BIMAsset VRM satisfies the above validation criteria. Furthermore, in the data analysis, there is a majority opinion that the BAMM satisfies the above validation criteria.The study led to the following findings: (a) The study reveals that operational information requirements are strongly related to business needs and that there cannot be a rigid requirement list for all clients. (b) The study identifies that in order to successfully integrate BIM-AM systems, the asset owner should consider the following; the development for a clear strategy prior to adoption; connecting the strategy to the business goals; the discovery of organisational information needs for the development of Information Requirement templates. (c) The study establishes that there is real value to be derived by the asset owner from the effective management of asset information and there are six typologies of BIM business value that can be derived in AM; management, commerce, efficiency, industry, user and technology value. (d) The study identifies BIM strategy, contract management, lifecycle management, maintenance management, work-order management and value realisation management as activity systems that drive BIM business value in AM. (e) The study has discovered that the capability of asset owners to derive business value of BIM in AM has implementation and maturity implications. (f) The study suggests that intangible value can be tracked and measured through the activity of business value linkage using concept maps. (g) The study posits that the entire process of BIM business value realisation management is about driving change, measuring outcomes and continuous improvement of activity systems that drive value so as to validate predicted the desirable outcomes, discover the unpredicted desirable outcome, and eliminate both the predicted and unpredicted undesirable outcomes within the BIM-based AM system.The main scientific contribution of the study is the BIMAsset VRM which covers: (a) information requirement strategies; (b) BIM-AM systems integration techniques; (c) BIM business value realisation theory; (d) BIM-based information content management tools and techniques; (e) activity systems that drive BIM business value in AM; and (f) techniques for tracking and measuring tangible and intangible value in BIM-based processes. Similarly, the main practical contribution of this study is the deployment of BIMAsset VRM and BIMAsset Maturity Model (BAMM) in the form of a guide in an owner-operator organisation. The study discusses in great detail how an asset manager can plan, manage and implement the six dimensions of BIMAsset VRM in asset operations. Also, it presents a guide for tracking and measuring tangible and intangible BIM business value. These aspects ensure that the PhD thesis extends the current knowledge base and provides a cradle-to-grave approach to addressing the phenomenon of BIM business value realisation in an AM system during asset operations.

T1  - Down Syndrome Caregivers’ Support Needs: A Caregiver Perspective
AN  - 2714866305
AB  - The purpose of the study was to gain an understanding of the support needs caregivers of children with Down syndrome (DS) experience and to provide recommendations to services and advocacy agencies in the community. Caregiver perspectives were gained from individual interviews addressing the research question “Are parents of individuals with DS supported, why or why not?” Caregivers were involved in the analysis of the data through Concept Mapping procedures. Participants generated eight thematic clusters representing the support needs of caregivers of children with DS. The themes included online social support, community support gaps, areas where support is lacking, Down Syndrome community support, financial support, advocacy needs, educational support and concerns for community programming. The study highlights the need for more local organizations to offer support that is affordable and accessible for families. Results will support future program planning for services for individuals caring for those with DS.

T1  - Concept Mapping with Patients, Parents, Clinicians, and Researchers to Understand the Perception of Engagement and Value in a Learning Network: A Mixed Methods Study
AN  - 2688958779
AB  - The architecture of learning networks allows leaders to address the demand for the improved health of patients with chronic illnesses and their healthcare services. Even though the system is learning to address problems related to translating evidence into practice and coproduce improved care with patients, we do not know if important outcomes are indeed being improved for patients. A paucity of research has been published about coproducing outcomes in learning environments that includes the voices of patients and families.
Concept mapping, a structured participatory mixed methods design, was used to explore stakeholders’ (patients, parents, clinicians, and researchers) characterization of their involvement in learning activities that were designed to coproduce improved health and healthcare outcomes. Stakeholders participated in every concept mapping step. Participants were recruited from a care center that participates in a national learning network, designed to improve outcomes for patient and families living with inflammatory bowel disease.  
Exploration of stakeholder’s motivations to engage in learning networks to improve health and healthcare outcomes was guided by three frameworks, including Senge’s (2006) disciples of learning organization, Westaby’s (2012) dynamic network theory, and Fjeldstad’s actor-oriented network. The combination of frameworks allowed for integration and exploration of disparate explanations about psychosocial behaviors and interactions assumed to occur among engaged stakeholders in learning networks. The frameworks were used to conceptualize the dynamics of engagement, shape the research questions, and explore the phenomenon. 
Concept mapping follows a complex mixed methods structure that prioritizes qualitative methods. Six concept mapping steps, including preparation, idea generation, structuring, representation, interpretation, and utilization were used. A design team was formed, including patients, parents, clinicians, and researchers who were formal and informal leaders at the local center. During the preparation step the principal investigator (PI) and design team developed the recruitment strategy and the focus prompt. 
During the idea generation step, 18 participants contributed 80 unique answers about their engagement in coproduction activities. After content analysis, 56 statements emerged, representing stakeholder’s motivation to engage. In the next step, the design team sorted the statements by placing them into categories perceived to be similar. The sorted data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to develop the concept map.  
The ideas generated by participants were used to develop a survey. Twenty participants completed the survey, which used a Likert-type scale to assess items perceived to be important regarding their engagement. Members of the design team completed the feasibility survey which used a Likert-type scale to investigate items perceived to be easy to implement relative to engagement. Pattern matching analysis was conducted using average rating scores and were visually represented as ladder graphs. Ladder graphs depicted congruence of stakeholders’ perspectives about ideas that were important. Average ratings from survey data were also used to develop go-zone plots, demonstrating priority planning foci based on items rated highly important and highly feasible. During the final step, the design team participated in the planning session to interpret the concept map and determined how to utilize findings to improve engagement strategies.

T1  - Use of a Novel Approach to Assess Changes in Local Food Sourcing in a Sample of Oklahoma School Districts
AN  - 2540839230
AB  - Abstract: The purpose of this study was to identify changes in the extent to which
Oklahoma schools were using locally grown foods, what specific foods they were
purchasing and by what methods they were making the purchases. Barriers to local food
sourcing were also identified. Two concept maps and a demographic survey were used to
collect data from 25 school districts. Questions for each concept map were: 1) types of
procurement methods used to purchase locally grown foods and items purchased; and 2)
barriers to local purchasing. School representatives were recruited and pre-intervention
data collected at various training and professional meetings in Summer 2018. Postintervention data was collected in Fall 2019 after multiple farm-to-school promotional
materials and communications were disseminated. Hierarchical Structure Scores (HSS)
were calculated for each data set by adding the different levels of participants’ responses.
Types of procurement methods and types of food items were coded for frequency
analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize responding schools and paired ttests were used to compare pre- and post-intervention HSS. There was a significant
increase in HSS and the number of food types purchased. Overall, this study showed
improvement in Oklahoma schools purchasing more local food items following
dissemination of farm-to-school promotional material and communications, however
more steps need to be taken to overcome the barriers that are experienced in local food
procurement.

T1  - Dynamic Feedback as Automated Scaffolding to Support Learners and Teachers in Guided Authentic Scientific Inquiry Settings
AN  - 2512689433
AB  - Guided authentic scientific inquiry activities can give students a clear picture of the nature of science and how its fields operate in practice, but such activities are difficult to do well. Too much structure negates the benefit of open-ended activities and student-led investigation, while too little can result in frustration or unproductive floundering. The inclusion of scaffolds for students as well as teachers in such activities is necessary for their successful implementation. Virtual environments can facilitate open-ended inquiry activities by having built-in scaffolds, such as feedback that reacts dynamically to the actions of learners in real time. However, sparse experimental research exists on how formative feedback can best be deployed to students in open-ended immersive environments compared to more constrained tutoring systems or games. Additionally, these tools and curricula must include support for teachers in the design and implementation process if they are to be used in complex classroom settings. Cutting-edge techniques at the forefront of the educational data mining field are being developed for analyzing student actions in such settings, and interest in these techniques is steadily growing. This dissertation documents a pilot implementation of formative feedback tools embedded in the open-ended virtual world of EcoXPT, an experiential curriculum for learning ecosystems science and scientific inquiry. The efficacy of various types of feedback and methods of deployment to both students and teachers are explored, and student outcomes are compared with data from prior baseline EcoXPT implementations. Compared to students in baseline versions of EcoXPT, groups with access to these feedback tools had larger scientific epistemology gains, when controlling for other factors, and made more complete concept maps. Meaningful sequences of logged actions were identified that correlate positively with outcome measures, and overall trends in feature usage between teachers in the sample were described. Student feedback on the utility of the new feedback features is analyzed, and themes from teacher interviews are described to explore how they used the teacher-facing tools as well as how they saw students reacting to the additional tools.

T1  - Concept Mapping and Pedagogic Health in Higher Education : a Rhizomatic Exploration in Eight Plateaus
AN  - 2508785740
AB  - This submission presents a portfolio of 50 outputs (3 books, 7 book chapters and 40 journal articles) that were published between 2000-2020. This accompanying narrative offers a frame for these outputs to place them in the context of the wider literature and to highlight connections and developments in the underpinning thought processes. Here I exploit the Deleuzian figuration of the rhizome to present the portfolio to emphasise the non linear nature of this body of work and provide a novel conceptual framework for analysis. This corpus emerged from my initial exploration of Novakian concept mapping as a tool to support and document learning. From my early studies that built on the dominant discourse of the field, I examined concept mapping as a study aid. From this my interests diverged into the visualisation of expertise and the implications of variation in the structure of knowledge as depicted by students and as promoted in the curriculum. I started to use concept mapping to explore educational theory and have combined the tool that is strongly linked to its origins in educational psychology (particularly the work of David Ausubel) with other theoretical positions that might inform teaching in higher education. These have included ideas from the sociology of education (particularly the work of Basil Bernstein and Karl Maton); ideas from evolutionary Biology (Stephen Jay Gould’s concept of exaptation); ideas from health sciences (particularly the work on Salutogenesis by Anton Antonovsky), and the post-structuralist ideas of Gilles Deleuze (especially the concept of the rhizome). These ideas offer an opportunity to revise and refresh the assumptions that underpinned Joe Novak’s work on concept mapping – that might increase the level of criticality in continuing research. This work raises questions about the methodological conservatism of the field of concept mapping (and perhaps of higher education research more broadly). The observed methodological and conceptual conservatism of the concept mapping literature is seen as a consequence of its linear (arborescent) development from science education. Through this work, the reader can trace the development of the researcher from his roots in Biological Sciences towards a greater appreciation of post-structuralist perspectives – challenging the conservatism mentioned above.

T1  - Concept Maps as Sites of Rhetorical Invention: Teaching the Creative Act of Synthesis as a Cognitive Process
AN  - 2478562444
AB  - Synthesis is one of the most cognitively demanding practices novice writers must undertake, and research demonstrates that first-year students’ synthesis writing practices result in more knowledge telling rather than knowledge creation and transforming. Pedagogies used to teach synthesis often focus on developing text-building strategies but lack explicit instruction on the more cognitively demanding conceptualizing behavior. To explore alternative pedagogies and heuristics, this study looks beyond composition scholarship to incorporate studies in neuroeducation and rhetoric to define synthesis as an ongoing, generative act of cognitive invention, effectively shifting pedagogical focus from text-centered product to student-centered cognitive processes that inform development of synthesized texts (a product). The methods were designed to explore any effects a visual intervention might have on developing student conceptual awareness and reflective practice over time, and whether that transferred into a final researched essay as knowledge transforming.This small-scale exploratory study applies a mixed-methods, design-based methodology to a semester-long intervention in first-year writing classrooms using digital concept maps (DCMAPs) as an ongoing, student-designed space of visualized concept construction. A Control group applied traditional reading-to-write text-based synthesis instruction and practice, while the Intervention group used DCMAPs to enact a prolonged, visualized and reflective practice of active construction of associations, relationships, and structural knowledge building. The DCMAP platform affordances positioned students as knowledge designers enacting creative/constructive processes, an approach based on neuroscience research on patterning and visualization. Intervention data includes reflective journals, narrated mapping process reflections, digital concept map images and construction processes, and a final researched essay that required synthesis of source ideas. Because of the exploratory nature of the study, results are not framed as cause-effect but as correlational possibilities that suggest inventional acts of visually creating connections and labeling them using rhetorically-based associational concepts lead to generative learning behaviors. Results suggest a number of possibilities for future iterations and research, as well as implications for our field’s approach to the teaching of synthesis.

T1  - Sustainable Change in a Teaching Career: A Self-Study of an Evolving Music Educator’s Journey
AN  - 2476149018
AB  - The purpose of the study is to examine how professional growth is sustained over time through exploring a teacher’s narrative of personal and professional growth. The central question of this dissertation is: What creates sustainable and continuous positive professional change and growth in a teacher’s professional life? In this study, I discuss my journey towards understanding my practice while teaching a collegiate course and the implications of my journey for continual professional and personal growth. I used self-study methods to interrogate the personal, professional, and contextual experiences that shaped my thinking about teaching, learning, and my practice. The process of reflection was prompted by various data sources, including journal entries, storytelling, memory work, an experience matrix, concept-mapping, and education-related life histories. This self-study also includes action research projects that I conducted while teaching a college course over seven semesters. Data for action research projects included student reflective writing, observations of their learning, video recordings of group project meetings, and student value-creation stories.Through reflection on how my personal, professional, and contextual knowledge of teaching developed, I examine how the values I held, the inquiries I undertook, and the communities in which I engaged affected my learning about teaching and shaped both my continuing professional development and who I am becoming as a teacher. Values that emerged in my teaching practice included: creating a student-friendly learning atmosphere, building a learning community, and being a reflective learner. Change agency functioned as a teacher lens and impacted student learning. I also analyzed patterns between my instructional plans, actions, and learning experiences in multiple professional communities. Professional and personal development relied not only on formal learning but was also promoted by informal learning opportunities and a personal learning process. Findings suggest that teachers’ attempts to engage with external resources and awareness of their personal orientations as internal resources appear essential for sustainable change in teaching practice. Teacher professional growth requires exercising positive personal qualities, such as confidence, compassion, and courage, as well as resilience as an educator and a lifelong learner. Teacher reflection and self-study play a pivotal role in enabling teachers to sustain professional growth.

T1  - Examining Social Exclusion by ‘Race’/Ethnicity in Toronto’s Health Care System: A Scientific Realist-Inspired Concept Mapping Study
AN  - 2468371436
AB  - With widening health inequities, developing an effective policy of action requires a better understanding of the mechanisms through which health inequities are distributed. The purpose of this doctoral research is to understand the effect of current hospital policies and practices on racial/ethnic groups at the level of the individual in Toronto’s health care system. The overall goal is to provide the explanatory power necessary to change policies and practices. 
Using concept mapping, a semi-qualitative study design, participants identified experiences of social exclusion when receiving health care in Toronto’s health care system. A political economy theory with a scientific realist philosophy of science was used to identify social causal mechanisms and explain how and why everyday racism occurs in Toronto’s health care setting.
From the brainstorming activity, participants generated 35 unique statements of ways in which patients feel disrespect and mistreatment when receiving health care. From the sorting and mapping activity, statements were grouped into five clusters: ‘Racial/ethnic and class discrimination’, ‘Dehumanizing the patient’, ‘Negligent communication’, ‘Professional misconduct’, and ‘Unequal access to health and health services’. Two distinct conceptual regions of social exclusion were identified: ‘Viewed as inferior’ and ‘Unequal medical access’. Clusters rated highly for ‘race’/ethnic based discrimination were ‘Racial/ethnic and class discrimination’ and ‘Dehumanizing the patient’. Racialized health care users reported ‘race’/ethnic based discrimination or everyday racism as largely contributing to the challenges experienced when receiving health care. From the go-zone data, statements rated high for ‘race’/ethnic based discrimination and taking action/change were ‘when the patient's symptoms are ignored or not taken seriously’, ‘when the health care provider does not provide the requested information’, and ‘when the health care provider belittles or talks down to the patient’.
To eliminate institutional racism, political will is needed to eliminate the ideology of racial inferiority often used for the purpose of justifying racist actions/unequal treatment. Anti-racist policies are needed to move beyond cultural competence polices and towards addressing the centrality of unequal power relations and everyday racism in health care. This has implications for nursing leadership, health care provider education, health care organizations, and health care practice.

T1  - Counselor Education Doctoral Students’ Research Self-Efficacy: A Concept Mapping Approach
AN  - 2452934073
AB  - Research self-efficacy (RSE) is a key concept not only for counselor educators as successful researchers but also for the advancement of counselor education field.  In the literature, researchers have studied multiple factors (e.g., research interest, productivity) to understand the complex nature of RSE phenomenon.  Despite being informative, these studies only focused on partial aspects of the multilayered RSE, showing methodological and conceptual limitations.  Particularly, we do not have a holistic understanding of RSE and the interrelated relationship among the factors informing RSE.  In the current study, the researcher used a mixed-methods design, Concept Mapping (Kane & Trochim, 2007) to explore the factors influencing counselor education doctoral students’ RSE in CACREP-accredited doctoral programs.  Current study findings yielded 17 clusters represented in six regions describing the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and systemic levels of Ecological Model (McLeroy et al., 1988).  The researcher discussed the findings in the view of the current literature along with implications for researcher training and future research practices as well as with the limitations of current study.

T1  - An Automated Feedback System to Support Student Learning of Conceptual Knowledge in Writing-To-Learn Activities
AN  - 2451158151
AB  - As a pedagogical strategy, Writing-to-Learn (WTL) intends to use writing to improve students’ understanding of course content. However, most of the existing feedback systems for writing are mainly focused on improving students’ writing skills rather than their conceptual development. In this dissertation, an automatic approach is proposed to generate timely, actionable, and individualized feedback based on comparing knowledge representations extracted from lecture slides and individual students’ writing assignments. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the feedback generation: to help students assimilate new knowledge into their existing knowledge better, their current knowledge is modeled as a set of matching concepts; suggested concepts and concept relationships for inclusion are generated as feedback by combining two factors, i.e., importance and relevance, of feedback candidates to the matching concepts in the domain knowledge. In the prototype system, a student can request feedback many times; each set of feedback is generated for a corresponding assignment draft to support their learning of conceptual knowledge during the iterative process of writing an assignment. 
This research conducts a repeated measures study across two semesters (N=88) to understand how students perceive the proposed system, explore how students use the automated feedback, and investigate the effects of the automated feedback on student learning. Survey results show that the feedback is perceived as relevant (78.4%), easy to understand (82.9%), accurate (76.1%) and useful (79.5%); survey results also find that the proposed system makes it easier to study course concepts (80.7%) and is useful in learning course concepts (77.3%). Based on the log analysis of students’ actual usage of the system, all participants request feedback at least once when using the proposed system. After requesting feedback, 83 out of 88 participants revise their assignments. Analyses of students’ submitted assignments reveal that more course concepts and concept relationships are included when completed using the proposed system. Collectively, these results show that the proposed automated feedback prototype system contributes to students incorporating more course concepts and concept relationships into their writing assignments, thus supports their learning of conceptual knowledge in a WTL activity.

T1  - Examining the Utilization of Cervical Cancer Screening in Urban Zimbabwe: Multi-Stakeholder Perspectives
AN  - 2449295430
AB  - Background: Zimbabwe is among the top six countries in sub-Saharan Africa with the highest burden of cervical cancer. Despite this burden, the utilization of cervical cancer screening remains low, even with the adoption of feasible and cost-effective screening strategies offered free of charge in the country. Previous research has highlighted the limited focus on the role of contextual factors (socio-cultural and structural) on cervical cancer screening. Additionally, little is known about the perspectives of healthcare providers, who have knowledge and experience of the healthcare system within which cervical cancer screening services are situated. Guided by the PEN-3 cultural model and Health Belief Model the objectives of the dissertation were to: 1) explore the socio-cultural, and structural factors associated with utilization of cervical cancer screening among women; and Aim 2) explore women’s and healthcare providers’ and women’s perceptions of screening utilization and provision of cervical cancer screening at health facilities in Harare and Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe. 
Methods: For Aim 1, data were collected using a survey questionnaire among women aged 18 to 49 years attending healthcare facilities. Multiple logistic regression was used to examine the survey data among 248 women. For Aim 2, 21 healthcare providers involved in cervical cancer prevention participated in one-on-one in-depth interviews and concept mapping. Interview data were analyzed using thematic analysis and concept mapping were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis in concept systems. 
Results: A higher proportion of women (55.6%) reported having ever had cervical cancer screening. After adjusting for perceived barriers, knowledge, and sociodemographic characteristics, a higher score on perceived social norms was significantly associated with a higher likelihood for screening (AOR:1.46, 95% CI: 1.21-1.76). Most participants preferred a no-cost screening service (n=243, 78.6%) and cost of screening was significantly associated with screening (p=0.0154). Healthcare providers and women similarly identified increased health promotion, experiencing symptoms, and influence from others as the facilitators for screening utilization. While travel and treatment costs, fear, and myths/misconceptions emerged as barriers for screening utilization. The major recommendations were to increase community-based health education, expand screening services, and, as uniquely identified by providers, train more providers in cervical cancer screening. 
Discussion: The study findings broaden our understanding of the role of sociocultural and structural context in the utilization of cervical cancer screening in high burden settings, like Zimbabwe. This suggests that interventions seeking to improve cervical cancer screening may yield a greater impact if they take into account and leverage on existing social and community networks, while addressing structural and health system barriers. Findings can provide guidance and inform future research aiming to understand and develop interventions to improve cervical cancer screening utilization.

T1  - Reconsidering Undergraduate Anatomy and Physiology Curriculum
AN  - 2444872580
AB  - In the past 50 years several convergent factors have spurred unprecedented change in anatomy and physiology (A&P) instruction. An explosion of biomedical knowledge, an increased demand for students well-versed in A&P, and decreased resources for the course has provoked a vast array of research. However, most studies employ one of three strategies to enact change: testing the effectiveness of new pedagogies, exploring the utility of new technologies, or documenting learning in new contexts. By comparison, a much smaller body of research focuses on changing the A&P curriculum to improve student learning. To address this gap, the musculoskeletal curriculum for an undergraduate A&P course was revised to align with evidenced-based pedagogical practices, ground it in learning theories, and promote learning in context. Students perceptions and values related to the course were measured via the Anatomy Learning Experiences Questionnaire (ALEQ) and interviews, while student learning was measured via concept maps. Students reported the value of understanding how structures work together as opposed to memorizing what structures are because they see it as relevant to their future careers. Introducing students to the concept of “functionally bound structures” in conjunction with the curricular changes outlined may prove to be a fruitful way of fostering students’ understanding of the how of A&P, while still arriving at the same knowledge of vocabulary. Future research should assess the curricular changes utilized across different institutional contexts, student populations, and content to validate their viability.

T1  - A Qualitative Study of Visualization Skills Used to Understand Chemical Bonding Theories
AN  - 2425565105
AB  - Visualization skills and spatial ability are necessary for understanding the 3-dimensional shapes of molecules using Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, hybrid orbital theory and understanding of sigma and pi bonding. Much research has been completed on visualization skills and alternative conceptions in chemistry education but there has been little focus on studying these skills for understanding of bonding theory in college chemistry. The aim of this study is to acquire an understanding of how community college chemistry students visualize in 3D and to collect feedback on their experiences of learning in order to provide information for better assessment tools and teaching strategies.
The method in this study involved interviewing 15 community college students who were either in the second semester of General Chemistry or taking Organic Chemistry. Data were transcribed and analyzed in conjunction with drawings and molecular models that were constructed and coded for recurring themes and concept understanding. It was found that most participants had a good understanding of molecular polarity and could use VSEPR theory to get the correct shape. Some found that using the Cartesian coordinate axis as a guide helped them to translate between the 2D Lewis structure and the 3D shape. Many had difficulty understanding symmetry, expressing 3-dimensionality in their drawings, determining expanded octet shapes, understanding hybrid orbital theory and understanding how the sigma and pi bonds form. Some of the recurring themes that emerged were the ‘value of using models’, a ‘disconnect’ between concepts, a lack of adequate ‘time’ spent on certain topics and the need to teach the requisite ‘terminology’. Some novel alternative conceptions were identified. These include  associating the unhybridized p-orbital with a lone electron pair, associating the pi bond with the p-orbital and the sigma bond with the s-orbital, associating the bond type with the hybridization, considering molecules with partial symmetry as symmetrical and the identification of a sigma bond as a single bond and a pi bond as a double or triple bond.  Other alternative conceptions identified were consistent with what was found in the literature. Novel recommendations were made on how to address these alternative conceptions and the student concerns that were expressed. Additionally, several concept maps were generated to outline how bonding theories could be learned in a series of steps to solve problems involving 3D structures in chemistry in order to minimize the development of  alternative conceptions.

T1  - Student Conceptualization of Stoichiometry
AN  - 2412192887
AB  - General Chemistry (I and II) is a year-long introductory course frequently taken at the start of the college career for STEM-intending students. It is broadly found to be difficult, and many students struggle. Stoichiometry describes the relationships between compounds and elements in a reaction. It is a fundamental concept that is taught in the first semester of General Chemistry as a building block for the understanding of future concepts in second-semester and upper-level chemistry courses. Students have a difficult time conceptualizing stoichiometry because it involves a combination of algorithms and builds off of other fundamentals. However, studies claiming to focus on conceptualization of stoichiometry have actually focused more on solving or conceptualizing chemistry problems using models that have been accepted by chemistry instructors.
The purpose of my study was to develop a framework for understanding how General Chemistry students conceptualize key topics in stoichiometry. Previous studies related to conceptualization focused on content delivery or how the students' conceptualization aligned with the instructors' or what is accepted by chemists rather than solely focusing on what students understand. In this study, I used a phenomenographic method to explore the different ways students conceptualize stoichiometry in General Chemistry. I conducted nineteen interviews with students enrolled in General Chemistry II at Clemson University. Incorporated in the results of this study is the analysis of the various ways students conceptualize chemistry. The result of this study is a model which describes the five different ways General Chemistry II students conceptualize stoichiometry. This study fills the literature gap by exploring students' conceptualizations of stoichiometry using Knowledge Space
Theory (KST).
This study will help instructors in higher education recognize that there are different ways students conceptualize the fundamentals being taught within the course, which may not completely align with the instructors' conceptualization. My study can help other STEM fields reflect upon conceptualization and the potential to increase retention for STEM programs. To do this, studying students' conceptualization will help instructors develop curricula that focus on understanding fundamentals along with algorithms which can help students view STEM as achievable, inevitably filling STEM-related jobs in the United States as well as regaining a positive outlook of the field by the general public.

T1  - The Influence of Globally Oriented Teachers’ Positionalities in World History Classrooms
AN  - 2395506479
AB  - Globally oriented content and perspectives are urgently needed in United States secondary classrooms as the world continues to become more interconnected. U.S. secondary students are typically exposed to global topics in world history courses. There is limited research on the intersection of global education and world history, particularly within empirical studies concerning teachers’ positionalities and practice. This qualitative study explores this gap by asking: How do self-identified globally oriented world history teachers’ positionalities influence their curricular and pedagogical decisions? The sub-questions are: What identities, experiences, and surrounding social structures shape teachers’ understanding of themselves as global educators? Where/when/how do world history teachers position themselves within the knowledge, material, and teaching about the world? This study, utilizing interviews, elicitation tasks (concept mapping, identity card sort, global image ranking), and observations of teaching, investigated eight globally oriented New York City public school world history teachers. Findings suggest reconceptualizing teacher positionalities to include worldviews and place-based experiences abroad in addition to identities, subjectivities, and contexts. These intertwining aspects of world history teachers’ positionalities influenced their practice to teach with a global orientation in a world history classroom. Four worldviews were significant in how these teachers framed the world for themselves and their students: interconnectedness, justice-orientations, cosmopolitanism, and critical perspectives. Place-based experiences abroad were significant aspects to their positionalities in that they gained content knowledge of the place while confronting their social positions and privileges. These engagements contributed to the ways in which they approached their knowledge construction of the world in their approaches to curriculum and teaching. I suggest these aspects of teacher positionalities be integrated into future research in global education and social studies teacher education programs.

T1  - Additive Manufacturing Methods for Electroactive Polymer Products
AN  - 2827703847
AB  - Electroactive polymers are a class of materials capable of reallocating their shape in response to an electric field while also having the ability to harvest electrical energy when the materials are mechanically deformed. Electroactive polymers can therefore be used as sensors, actuators, and energy harvesters. The parameters for manufacturing flexible electroactive polymers are complex and rate limiting due to number of steps, their necessity, and time intensity of each step. Successful additive manufacturing processes for electroactive polymers will allow for scalability and flexibility beyond current limitations, advancing the field, opening additional manufacturing possibilities, and increasing output. The goal for this research was to use additive manufacturing techniques to print conductive and dielectric substrates for building flexible circuits and sensors. Printing flexible conductive layers and substrates together allows for added creativity in design and application.

T1  - Reimagining Course Design Using Technology a Case-Study of How Faculty In India Learn to Integrate Technology Tools into Engineering Courses
AN  - 2827702273
AB  - In the last two decades, higher education researchers have reported numerous benefits of integrating technology tools in course instruction and their subsequent impact on the students’ learning process. In spite of the accumulation of the large amount of evidence and multiple calls to adopt technology tools in instruction, traditional lecturing is observed to dominate and continue being the preferred mode of instruction in STEM courses. One of the major reasons for the shortage of large-scale adoption of technology-based instruction is attributed to the lack of knowledge and skills of STEM instructors on how to effectively integrate technology tools into their courses. Most faculty development programs that are organized to help instructors build the necessary knowledge and skills end up introducing different technology tools to the instructors without truly helping them understand how to contextualize the tools based on the course requirements and learning needs of the study. This study aimed to understand the experiences of how engineering faculty in India learn to integrate technology tools as part of a 6-week faculty development program.Seven engineering faculty from a single institution attended the 6-week program to redesign a course of their choice by integrating educational technology tools. A conceptual framework called Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) was used to understand how the instructors learned to integrate technology tools into their respective courses. TPACK is a widely used framework that depicts an instructor’s knowledge of educational technology as a multifaceted construct that is combined with their knowledge of the course content and pedagogy. A qualitative case study approach was used in this study to understand how the engineering faculty developed TPACK and highlight the challenges that they encountered while integrating technology tools into their courses. Thematic analysis was employed to analyze the data that was collected through semistructured interviews, reflection journals, and final reflections.The findings from the study indicate that the faculty developed TPACK in three stages. In the first stage, they developed basic knowledge of content, pedagogy, and technology (also called basic sub-domains of TPACK). The faculty in the next stage formed mental models to intersect and understand the interrelations between the three basic sub-domains. In the last stage, the faculty developed TPACK by building a meta-conceptual awareness of how to utilize the knowledge gained in stage two to address the limitations in their current mode of instruction and the learning needs of the students. It was observed that the faculty after developing TPACK started to emphasize on a more student-centric mode of instruction. The faculty reported to encounter challenges while constructing mental models as they were unable to critically reflect on their courses. They faced difficulty while identifying and integrating technology tools as a result of lowtechnology self-efficacy. Faculty reported to overcome these challenges and receive support from the other participants as a result of a community of practice that was established prior to the start of the faculty development program. The study at the end provides recommendations to faculty developers on how to design and facilitate effective workshops that are aimed to help instructors integrate technology tools. A model which was developed from the findings of the study is provided to promote large scale integration of technology-based instruction in universities.

T1  - An Experimental Investigation of Semi-Automatic Generation of Concept Maps From Textbooks
AN  - 2779136153
AB  - A concept map is a useful tool to organize and structure unstructured data, in this case, the information contained in a textbook. In education, a concept map can be used to set learning goals, monitor progress and visualize relationships between concepts. Constructing concept maps manually is a complex and time-consuming task which usually requires domain experts. Automatic creation of concept maps from documents is called concept map mining. In this study, we explore various technical approaches to semi automate the process of generating a concept map from an e-textbook. The approach selected is to use the topics listed in the appendix as concepts and mine the relation between pairs of topics using natural language processing and machine learning. Limitations of this approach and directions for future research are discussed.

T1  - General Ward Nurses’ Experiences and Attitudes Towards Recognizing and Escalating Care for Clinically Deteriorating Patients: An Exploratory Study with Scale Development
AN  - 2723858428
AB  - Background: Rapid response systems have been widely implemented in hospitals to support ward staff in the recognition and timely escalation of care for clinically deteriorating patients. However, little is known about how junior doctors and nurses in general wards recognize and escalate care for deteriorating patients within an established rapid response system. Furthermore, there is no validated instrument that measures registered nurses’ attitudes and perceptions in relation to clinically deteriorating ward patients.Aims: This study aimed to (1) explore the experiences of ward nurses and junior doctors in recognizing and escalating care for clinically deteriorating patients in general wards and (2) develop and test the psychometric properties of the Clinicians’ Attitudes toward Responding and escalating care for Deteriorating patients (CARED) scale for use among ward registered nurses.Methods: An exploratory sequential mixed method study was adopted. In Phase one, individual interviews were conducted with 10 junior doctors, 14 registered nurses and eight enrolled nurses of a 1000-bedded restructured hospital with the most established rapid response system in Singapore. In phase two, the CARED scale was developed from findings from Phase one study and extant literature and expert reviews. The reliability and validity of the scale was evaluated by administering it to 620 registered nurses working in the general wards, with retest evaluation (n = 60). The factor structure of the CARED scale was examined in a split-half analysis with exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. The internal consistency reliability, test-retest reliability, construct validity, and known-group validity of the scale were also analysed.Results: Seven themes emerged from Phase one: having a sense of knowing, patient assessment practices, missing the big picture, delegation of routine patient care and assessment to enrolled nurses, medical emergency team activations versus the primary team doctors’ reviews, challenges in obtaining medical reviews and the unspoken rules of the escalation of care. In Phase two, a high overall content validity index of 0.95 was obtained from the validation of 15 international experts from seven countries. A three-factor solution was identified from the final 22 items: ‘beliefs on RRS’, ‘fears about escalating care’, and ‘perceived confidence in responding to deteriorating patients’. The internal consistency reliability of the scale was supported with a good Cronbach’s alpha value of 0.86 and a Spearman-Brown split-half coefficient of 0.87. An excellent test-retest reliability was demonstrated with an intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.92. The construct validity of the scale was supported with an existing validated scale (r = 0.55, p<0.01). The CARED scale also demonstrated abilities to discriminate differences among sample characteristics.Conclusion: This study reveals that the recognition and escalation of care for clinically deteriorating patients in general wards is complex and multidimensional. The findings have provided directions to support the roles of registered nurses in this area. The final 22-item CARED scale has demonstrated evidence of acceptable reliability and validity.

T1  - Teachers' Perceptions and Experiences in Teaching Life Sciences Using Their Second Language
AN  - 2520789216
AB  - Language is one of the most important aspects of science teaching and learning, and Vygotsky (1978) inferred that language provides individuals with the sense of thought, cognition and social belonging. Thus, it is critical that language difficulties in science classes are addressed. South African township schools are characterised by cultural and linguistic diversity; hence life sciences teachers face a difficult task of ensuring that scientific concepts are grasped by learners at the same time as they need to cater for the learners' diverse backgrounds. This study was aimed at investigating teachers' perceptions and experiences in teaching life sciences using their second language. The study was underpinned by the socio-constructivism perspective, since the main focus was on language in life sciences classes. The study took place in Orange Farm, a township characterised by culturally and linguistically diverse people. The sample included six teachers who were all English-second-language speakers. The researcher collected data via two modes. Firstly, in order to establish teachers' perceptions regarding the teaching of life sciences using English, which is their second language, the researcher administered structured interviews with each of the six teachers. Secondly, in order to explore teachers' experiences in teaching life sciences using English, which is their second language, the six teachers were each observed while teaching a grade 11 life sciences class. The findings from both interviews and observations showed that language difficulties are prominent in life sciences classes, and township teachers experience various challenges in ensuring that scientific concepts are well explained to the learners. The findings also indicated that the perceptions teachers hold are different from their actual experiences in the life sciences classrooms.

T1  - An investigation into developing the mathematical achievement for foundation students in Kuwait
AN  - 2371841266
AB  - Kuwait's educational leaders have been putting efforts into improving their educational systems for the past 30 years. However, Kuwaiti students have performed in lower percentiles, in comparison with other countries, in international testing projects such as the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS). This study investigated the development of a new framework that could improve students' mathematical achievement for freshmen students at an American university foundation program in Kuwait. The framework is based on exploring approaches that can improve students' mathematical self-efficacy, motivation and understanding. The study explored students' mathematical backgrounds, self-efficacy, motivation, and mathematical understanding during the course. The study was divided into four stages (0 to 3). Students were asked to answer the background, self-efficacy, and motivation questionnaires at stage 0 of the study. They also answered a level quiz that examined their previous mathematics knowledge. They were also asked to draw concept maps for analysising and explored their conceptual understanding of their previous mathematical knowledge. For the stages (1 to 3), the students completed the self-efficacy and motivation questionnaires, drew concept maps, and took three major tests (Test 1, Test 2, and Test 4). Also, a sample of the students was interviewed at the end of the course. The study analysis from stage 0 revealed that many students participating in the study graduated from the school system with low self-efficacy and motivation levels towards studying mathematics, which may not have been helpful for their future studies. The study also found that the students were mathematically-procedurally driven more than conceptually and that they found it difficult to apply the mathematics knowledge that they acquired at school. During the course, the researcher applied educational approaches that students had not been exposed to during their high school nor previous college mathematical courses. The educational approaches included group work, gamification and puzzle sheets, revision notes, small boards, and correcting the students' own errors, online homework, and social media (WhatsApp) group application (outcome). The researcher used these educational approaches to develop the 'Successful Mathematics Implementing Classroom' (SMIC) framework. The SMIC framework explained how the approaches from the relevant literature used could improve students' mathematical self-efficacy, motivation, and mathematical understanding in order to improve students' mathematical achievement. The students participating in the study showed noticeable improvements in their self-efficacy, motivation, and mathematical understanding levels during the course, most noticeably from stages 0 to 1. Also, the students showed a major improvement in their test scores especially from stages 0 to 1. There was a positive correlation between students' self-efficacy and their test scores as well as a positive correlation between students' motivation and their test scores in this study. Concept maps analysis showed improvements in the students' conceptual understanding during the course. The students' interviews confirmed that each educational approach used in the course had positively influenced students' self-efficacy, motivation, and their mathematical understanding during the course. This improved students' mathematical achievement at the end of the course. The study provided different recommendations for school and college educators such as using the SMIC framework or other similar frameworks that focus on improving students' self-efficacy, motivation, and mathematical understanding in order to improve their mathematical achievement.

T1  - The Role of Social Media Applications and Hook-up Culture Among Black College-aged Men Who Have Sex with (MSM): Examining Health Outcomes
AN  - 2322130908
AB  - BACKGROUND:  The changing nature of sexual hookup encounters has marked an unprecedented shift in sexual norms.  There have been a plethora of studies that examine the prevalence of hook- up encounters and the devastating physiological, emotional, and sexual health effects among college-aged gay black men.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine the role of hooking up using social media applications such as Jack’d, Grindr, and Tinder and the role they play in sexual health outcomes among college-aged black men who have sex with men (MSM). Special attention will focus on hook-up culture among black college-aged MSM. Barriers and areas of opportunity for health promotion activities and improved outcomes among this understudied population were examined and will be used to improve health outcomes among this priority population.
METHODS: This study used qualitative research methods to collect information about hook-up culture among black college-aged men who have sex with men (MSM). Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with black gay and MSM participants in Florida.  A grounded theory approach was used to theory-build, rather than theory-test. Data were transcribed and analyzed using QSR NVIVO™ 12 plus. The transcripts were reviewed by two individuals to ensure the maintenance of inter-rater reliability and validity during the coding process. Codes and themes were gathered from all interviews and concept mapped to formulate a model.
 RESULTS: Results of this study depict the intricate nature of using social media apps such as Jackd, Grindr, and Tinder among gay black men. Six themes emerged shedding light on the complexities of hook-up culture, and social media applications. A model was formulated specifying several aspects of the interwoven connection between overall hook-up experiences, which are determined by positive or negative experiences. These experiences affect the perception of hook-up experiences, psychological aspects of hooking up, and sexual risk-taking during hook-up encounters.
CONCLUSION:   Using a grounded theory approach allowed for an understanding of hook-up experiences among gay black men and factors that influence these experiences. Understanding hook-up culture among gay black men could aid in the development of interventions that take into account the myriad of issues black gay men faces while using these applications.

T1  - Using Visual Supports to Increase the Comprehension of Science Texts for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder
AN  - 2306302714
AB  - This study originally proposed a multitreatment (ABACAC) study design. This design was altered to an ABAB reversal design when both participants showed an increase in correct responding to science comprehension questions when just visual supports were introduced (e.g.,concept map and visual cues). Two Kindergarten boys diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participated in this study. This study presented the visual supports (e.g., concept map and visual cues) via iPad. The findings from this study support the findings found in accommodating students with ASD with concept maps, visual cues, and the use of technology. In addition, this study adds to the literature by helping participants make meaning and understand relationships with visual supports that accommodate the weak central coherence theory. Social validity measures collected from both the participants and their mothers show this study was socially important, socially acceptable, and socially significant.

T1  - Advancing Academics Through Laboratory and Classroom Research: Probing Biomolecular Structure with Novel Mass Spectrometry Methods and Revisiting Student Learning Tools
AN  - 2295515129
AB  - The development of mass spectrometry (MS) as a tool for the characterization of biological molecules has seen rapid growth over the past three decades. The structure of a peptide or protein is key to its function and the role it plays within a biological environment. Several tools are available for determination of primary structure, however higher order structural characterization continues to be more challenging. As such, the development of new analytical methodology for the structural characterization of peptides and proteins is of significant interest. 
Wavelength selection is key to modulate fragmentation and biomolecule characterization when combining spectroscopy and MS. By coupling 213nm ultraviolet photodissociation (UVPD) with MS, both bond-specific dissociation and traditional nonspecific UVPD are observed. 213nm UVPD showed enhanced Carbon-Sulfur bond dissociation, leading to an investigation of their potential as energy acceptors in an action excitation energy transfer system. 266nm excitation of synthetic peptides containing methionine and a native aromatic donor revealed low energy transfer efficiency, leading to an investigation of a common methionine analogue: selenomethionine. Examination of C-Se bonds within synthetic peptides revealed enhanced energy transfer efficiency. This indicates selenomethionine may prove useful for probing protein structure in the gas phase. Photoinitiated radical chemistry has proven useful for breaking covalent bonds but may also have a role in a different application: bond synthesis in the gas phase. To show this, 266nm photoactivation of peptides, peptide pairs, and peptide-noncovalent complexes that contained either S-S or C-I bonds create sulfur- and carbon-centered radicals. Following radical attack or radical migration, the formation of new S-S or C-C bonds in the gas phase. 
The development and implementation of education tools, to improve student learning gains, is a key area of research in chemical education. A quarter-long concept mapping exercise was used in an effort to improve student conceptual understanding. Students participating in the quasi-experiment showed higher self-reported learning gains, and those that performed better on the concept mapping activity scored higher on concept inventory questions. Collectively, this work demonstrates that chemistry in the laboratory is just as important as chemistry in the classroom, and advances in both will lead to better scientific innovation.

T1  - Anthropic Thinking about Global Climate Change
AN  - 2284626282
AB  - Climate scientists agree that a) human activity is a significant driver of recent climate change, and b) climate change is a danger to humanity. However, the general public accepts the former point, but rejects the latter. Thus, climate experts and the general public diverge in their understanding of the relationship between humans and climate change. My dissertation examines the role of intuitive patterns of thinking in public perceptions of climate change. Of specific interest is construal-based thinking: intuitive frameworks that are generally useful in the context of everyday reasoning, but can engender systematic misconceptions in other scientific domains (e.g., biology). Results revealed that one such construal—anthropic thinking—is recruited when thinking about climate change and impacts global climate change understanding and engagement. Anthropic thinking is a set of intuitive frameworks that are united in their distortion of the relationship between humans and the natural world. Among these frameworks are exceptionalist thinking (i.e., thinking that humans are exceptional to, and unique from other species) and anthropomorphic thinking (i.e., the attribution of human properties to non-human organisms). I conducted four studies to examine whether undergraduates recruit anthropic thinking in the context of global climate change, and the consequences of reliance on such patterns of thinking.Study One examined construal-based thinking about global climate change using an in-lab battery designed for this purpose. I modified sets of pre-existing measures of construal-based thinking to inquire about climate change. Of the investigated construals, participants only consistently engaged in exceptionalist thinking about climate change which tended to involve the correct belief that humans are uniquely contributing to climate change and the incorrect belief that humans are uniquely impervious to the effects of climate change. Moreover, participants performed similarly on measures of exceptionalist thinking about climate change and biology—a domain that is understood to be susceptible to such patterns of thinking.Study Two tested whether individuals spontaneously engage in construal-based thinking about climate change by investigating patterns of language used during semi-structured interviews about climate change. Of the investigated construals, participants most commonly used anthropic patterns of language to describe climate change. Anthropomorphic language was particularly common, revealing that individuals attributed human qualities (e.g., emotions, goals) to non-human organisms (e.g., the Earth, plants and animals) when discussing climate change. Interestingly, the use of such language during these interviews predicted increased understanding of climate change, suggesting that use of anthropomorphic analogies might aid understandings. Further, participants used exceptionalist language when describing both causes and effects of climate change, corroborating findings from the first study.Study Three investigated the predictive role of anthropic thinking in understanding and concern surrounding global climate change. Using a time-pressured manipulation, I encouraged individuals to either respond quickly (preventing them from using more deliberate reasoning strategies) or slowly (allowing deliberate strategies) to a set of true/false questions about climate change. Surprisingly, exceptionalist and anthropomorphic thinking only predicted climate change understanding in the time delay condition, suggesting that anthropic thinking is not readily available to influence knowledge when individuals must make responses quickly, but rather, may represent a more deliberative reasoning heuristic. Furthermore, anthropomorphic thinking was positively associated with concern about global climate change across conditions. Combined with findings from Study Two, these demonstrate that anthropic thinking could have a role in both aiding and hindering understanding and engagement with climate change.Finally, Study Four investigated whether exceptionalist thinking about climate change could be reduced by increasing the salience of conceptual connections between humans and global climate change. To do so, I used a concept-mapping task wherein individuals drew connections between human-related concepts (e.g., burning fossil fuels) and global climate change. Participants who completed concepts maps at the beginning of the battery showed decreased exceptionalist thinking about climate change causes and effects compared to those who completed concept maps at the end of the battery, suggesting that exceptionalist thinking about climate change may rest on decreased salience that humans both a) play a role in causing climate change and b) will be affected by climate change. Exceptionalist thinking also predicted decreased attribution of damage due to recent environmental disasters (e.g., hurricanes Florence and Michael) to global climate change. This demonstrates a way in which exceptionalist thinking might act as a cognitive barrier to understanding how climate change can impact humans.This body of research extends previous investigations of intuitive thinking and scientific understandings to a novel and timely domain: global climate change. Notably, these findings demonstrate that people recruit exceptionalism and anthropomorphism when thinking about climate change, and that these patterns of thinking influence their understanding and engagement with the issue. I discuss the implications of these results for education, and their potential utility in the development of interventions to improve public perceptions of climate change as well as science more broadly.

T1  - The Impact of A Science Fair on High School Students’ Feelings of Self-Efficacy in Stem
AN  - 2275500832
AB  - The purpose of this present action research study was to describe secondary students’ feelings of self-efficacy in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).  Through a curriculum linked to a science fair project, the teacher-researcher focused on student-participants’ perceptions of perseverance and task completion linked to STEM courses and postsecondary STEM careers.  A Likert scale pretest (n=44) and posttest (n=33) based on Bandura’s model of four categories of self-efficacy (mastery experience, vicarious experiences, verbal/social persuasion, and emotional/psychological states) was administered to middle to low income students at a high school in Pennsylvania in the fall of 2018.).  Data was also collected data through semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, teacher journal entries, observational field notes, and concept maps.  Findings revealed that there was a 3.19% decrease across the cumulative average of all participants in STEM self-efficacy, and a 0.25% increase in the cumulative average of the economically disadvantaged group.  
Three domains were measured in this action research: social, academic, and emotional.  For the social domain, there was a 0.84% decrease in scores across the entire population, with scores of 33.75 on the pretest and 33.47 on the posttest. Within this domain, average scores for the economically disadvantaged population increased by 5.81% pretest to posttest from 33.83 to 35.8, respectively.  Academic domain scores decreased by 3.27% , from 33.18 pretest to 32.10 postest.  In the same domain, economically disadvantaged students decreased from 3.61%, from 33.75 pretest to 33.54 posttest.  Lastly, emotional scores dropped 5.99% among the entire population, from 31.09 pretest to 29.23 posttest and emotional scores in the economically disadvantaged decreased by 4.79%, from 30.25 pretest to 28.8 posttest.  This data was polyangulated through semi-structured interviews, informal interviews, teacher journal entries, observational field notes, and concept maps.  
To improve participation of economically disadvantaged students in STEM science fairs, an action plan of researching, developing, and sharing strategies for self-efficacy in learners will be developed.   This data is helpful as it provided a platform for an action plan to be facilitated to improve the Science Fair preparation process to promote STEM self-efficacy.

T1  - Deeper Understanding of Tutorial Dialogues and Student Assessment
AN  - 2268337856
AB  - Bloom (1984) reported two standard deviation improvement with human tutoring which inspired many researchers to develop Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) that are as effective as human tutoring. However, recent studies suggest that the 2-sigma result was misleading and that current ITSs are as good as human tutors. Nevertheless, we can think of 2 standard deviations as the benchmark for tutoring effectiveness of ideal expert tutors. In the case of ITSs, there is still the possibility that ITSs could be better than humans.One way to improve the ITSs would be identifying, understanding, and then successfully implementing effective tutorial strategies that lead to learning gains. Another step towards improving the effectiveness of ITSs is an accurate assessment of student responses. However, evaluating student answers in tutorial dialogues is challenging. The student answers often refer to the entities in the previous dialogue turns and problem description. Therefore, the student answers should be evaluated by taking dialogue context into account. Moreover, the system should explain which parts of the student answer are correct and which are incorrect. Such explanation capability allows the ITSs to provide targeted feedback to help students reflect upon and correct their knowledge deficits. Furthermore, targeted feedback increases learners' engagement, enabling them to persist in solving the instructional task at hand on their own.In this dissertation, we describe our approach to discover and understand effective tutorial strategies employed by effective human tutors while interacting with learners. We also present various approaches to automatically assess students' contributions using general methods that we developed for semantic analysis of short texts. We explain our work using generic semantic similarity approaches to evaluate the semantic similarity between individual learner contributions and ideal answers provided by experts for target instructional tasks. We also describe our method to assess student performance based on tutorial dialogue context, accounting for linguistic phenomena such as ellipsis and pronouns. We then propose an approach to provide an explanatory capability for assessing student responses. Finally, we recommend a novel method based on concept maps for jointly evaluating and interpreting the correctness of student responses.

T1  - Preservice Teachers' Pedagogical Content Knowledge Outcomes associated with a K-12 Dinosaur Learning Progression
AN  - 2682826356
AB  - Curriculum developments guiding science in schools have evolved from textbook-based teaching to integrated content approaches focusing on the nature of science. The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) reflect a reformed and authentic science pedagogy in the most innovative manner for any curriculum guide to date. Learning progressions (LPs) are a current innovation changing science education that support NGSS goals. LPs provide a guide for aligning mastery of science conceptsover time and integrate topics between different concentrations of science.The preparation of science teachers has relied heavily upon traditional science courses at the collegiate level. Conventionally, preservice teachers develop pedagogical practices through education coursework and field placements in K-12 schools. To fullyensure the development of scientific literate teachers, preservice science teacher education needs to focus on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). Preservice teachers need to be able to teach beyond the explicitly stated examples provided in curriculumframeworks and meet the interests of their future students.In this three-article dissertation, I explored the development and use of a LP in preservice teacher education. In the first article, I outlined a new methodology for creating valid LPs by utilizing expert interviews and documents for triangulation. TheLP I built used dinosaurs, the number one science interest of students entering school, as the thematic vehicle for delivery of Earth and life science concepts. In the second and third articles, I targeted the developed dinosaur LP as an intervention for meeting theneeds of enhancing preservice teacher PCK. In the second article, I used concepts maps to measure the conceptual knowledge gains of preservice teachers. The third article reported results of preservice teachers’ pedagogy transformations in the form of 5Elesson plans.Results suggested LPs can increase preservice teacher PCK in targeted conceptual areas and pedagogy, as reflected in concept maps and lesson plans. Significant differences existed between individual and group-developed concept maps, indicating distributed cognition may increase PCK development. Examination of pre- and postintervention lesson plans revealed significant gains in pedagogical methods for the overall construction and subcomponents of lesson plans. These results supported the useof LPs as interventions impacting preservice teacher PCK.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate Turkish students’ misconceptions about general science subjects. Variables such as gender, school type, grade, age, and school level were employed in the present study. Descriptive research method was used and the sample consisted of 749 students (male=364, female=385) from two state middle schools, two state high schools, one private middle school, and one private high school located in the Çankaya district of Ankara. The instrument used was the Turkish translated version of the questionnaire “A Survey of Some Science- Related Ideas – SSSRI.” SSSRI was developed by Osborne, Freyberg, & Bell (1985) for the purpose of determining students’ misconceptions on general science subjects. The SSSRI contains 19 multiple-choice type and one open-ended question. The questionnaire was administered to students in the fall term of 2017-18 academic year. The analyses of data were conducted by taking into consideration students’ grades of science, biology, physics, and chemistry courses, total scores of students, and their responses to each item. Descriptive statistical analyses were conducted to determine students’ levels of misconceptions based on variables: gender, school type, grade, age, and school level. Independent samples t-test was used to find out if there were significant differences between mean scores within gender and school type. One-way ANOVA was conducted to determine if there was significant difference between mean scores of grades. Additionally, Pearson correlation coefficients were computed between total scores of students and their grades of science, biology, physics and chemistry courses. Analyses demonstrated that students’ misconceptions about general science subjects were independent from their gender and school type. Moreover, students still had misconceptions, especially in topics “electric current” and “change of state of water.”Alternate abstract:Çalışmanın amacı, Türk öğrencilerinin fen konularındaki kavram yanılgılarını araştırmaktır. Bu çalışmada cinsiyet, okul türü, sınıf, yaş ve okul seviyesi gibi değişkenler kullanılmıştır. Çalışmada betimleyici araştırma yöntemi kullanılmıştır ve Ankara’nın Çankaya ilçesindeki, 2 ortaokul ve 2 lise olmak üzere 4 devlet okulundaki, 1 ortaokul ve 1 lise olmak üzere 2 özel okulundaki 749 (erkek=364, kız=385) öğrencinin katılımı ile gerçekleştirilmiştir. Veri toplama aracı olarak “Bazı Fen Kavramlarını Belirleme Anketi’nin” (BFKBA) Türkçe versiyonu kullanılırmıştır. BFKBA öğrencilerin fen konularındaki kavram yanılgılarını ortaya çıkarmak amacıyla Osborne, Freyberg, & Bell (1985) tarafından geliştirilmiştir. BFKBA 19 çoktan seçmeli ve 1 açık uçlu soru içermektedir. Öğrenciler çalışmaya 2017-18 akademik yılının sonbahar döneminde katılmışlardır. Veriler öğrencilerin fen, biyoloji, fizik ve kimya derslerindeki notlarını, anketteki toplam puanlarını ve her soru için verdikleri cevapları göz önünde bulundurarak analiz edilmiştir. Öğrencilerin cinsiyet, okul türü, sınıf, yaş ve okul seviyesi değişkenlerine göre kavram yanılgıları seviyelerini belirlemek için betimleyici istatistiksel analiz yapılmıştır. Bağımsız örneklemler t testi, cinsiyet ve okul türünün kendi içindeki gruplarının ortalama skorları arasında belirleyici bir fark olup olmadığını ortaya koymak için kullanılmıştır. Tek yönlü varyans analizi, sınıfların ortalama skorları arasında belirleyici bir fark olup olmadığını belirlemek için yapılmıştır. Ayrıca, öğrencilerin fen, biyoloji, fizik ve kimya dersleri notlarıyla anketteki toplam puanları arasındaki Pearson korelasyon katsayıları hesaplanmıştır. Çalışma sonucunda, öğrencilerin fen konularındaki kavram yanılgılarının cinsiyetlerinden ve okul türlerinden bağımsız olduğu gözlenmiştir. Buna ek olarak, öğrenciler özellikle “elektrik akımı” ve “suyun hal değişimi” konularında hala kavram yanılgılarına sahiptir.

T1  - An Exploration of School Staff Support for Children and Young People Experiencing Psychological Loss in One Secondary Pupil Referral Unit.
AN  - 2344262863
AB  - Experiences of psychological loss are both hugely significant and inevitable life events. Support of psychological loss for children and young people (CYP) in schools is therefore relevant to the role of educational psychologists (EPs). The two phases of the current research explored psychological loss support for CYP from the perspective of the school staff who deliver it. Conceptual mapping techniques and semi-structured interviews with 18 participants, working across 3 school settings, helped to map support of psychological loss in the first phase of the current research. Using thematic analysis an overall system of support for CYP experiencing psychological loss was identified, with adjustments to the support system suggested to be required according to the age and development of CYP. Relationships between school staff and CYP were highlighted as pivotal to the success of support for psychological loss within this system, suggesting that EP support for psychological loss may be best placed in offering support to those who are supporting CYP in schools. In order to explore an approach to supporting school staff with psychological loss, a case study of an EP training programme with 9 participants from a secondary PRU school setting was outlined in the second phase of the research. It was found that adopting an approach that was specific and relevant to the setting, with a focus on the language associated with loss and celebration of existing supportive practice of participants, enabled the knowledge and confidence of school staff to support CYP experiencing psychological loss to be increased. With positive outcomes for the school setting reported. Implications for further research and EP practice are considered.

T1  - Perceptions of Factors That Influence The Potential Use of Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP)
AN  - 2193739059
AB  - Background: In the United States, African American women are twenty times more likely than white counterparts to contact Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) is a medication proven to reduce the likelihood of acquiring HIV in high-risk populations. Despite the high HIV infection rate, there is little known about factors that might influence the likelihood of using PrEP in African American.    Purpose: This dissertation had two aims (1) to describe the HIV sexual risk behaviors, use of media as a potential source of PrEP information, HIV testing intentions, and current levels of PrEP awareness of high-risk African American women in order to determine the most effective ways of informing them about PrEP, (2) to determine which factors influence African American women’s likelihood of using PrEP for HIV prevention and (3) to compare African American women’s perceptions of factors influencing PrEP use to perceptions of healthcare providers.    Methods: This Chicago based study has enrolled 48 African American women, ages 18-49, at high-risk for acquiring HIV and 10 healthcare providers. The inductive, qualitative approach of concept mapping in conjunction with quantitative analysis using Concept System Software was used. The questionnaire collected information on current media use, HIV testing history, sexual risk behaviors, and demographics. To ensure basic understanding of PrEP, participants received education about PrEP by watching a five-minute animated video from whatisprep.com. Trochim’s concept mapping process has six steps: preparation, generation of statements (brainstorming), structuring of statements (sorting & rating), representation of statements (analysis), focus group discussion (interpretation of maps), and utilization of maps. Data was entered into Concept System Software (CS Global Max).    Results: African American women who engage in high-risk behaviors perceive themselves to be at low risk for HIV acquisition. African American women are not being informed about PrEP during visits for HIV tests or routine healthcare visits. Television, radio, and Facebook may be ideal modes for disseminating PrEP information, as these media were used frequently by participants in an average month. African American women have little awareness of PrEP, and the study participants did not know other women who had used PrEP. In terms of concept mapping, 8 clusters were identified as factors likely to influence the use of PrEP and “Knowing that PrEP will prevent me from getting HIV when my partner won’t use a condom” was the most likely to influence potential use of PrEP among African American women, whereas healthcare providers perceived “Having an HIV positive partner” to be the most influential statement.

AN  - 2165930720
AB  - Background: Patient navigation is an increasingly popular tool used in healthcare to address disparities in cancer care. Interpersonal communication is considered a critically important construct in patient navigation, although it is understudied. Moreover, the patient-navigator relationship may be influenced by the interpersonal communication skills and behaviors of the patient navigator. The primary goal of this dissertation research was to explore the perspectives of key stakeholders (patients, patient navigators and patient navigator administrators) on the interpersonal communication components of breast cancer care patient navigation and the relationship of these components to the patient-navigator relationship.   Methods: This study employed concept mapping, an innovative community-engaged mixed method approach that produces pictorial views of how concepts are interrelated. Key stakeholders participated in study planning and participants completed the concept mapping activities, including brainstorming, sorting, rating, and interpretation. Brainstorming, sorting and rating were completed online. Interpretation took place through in-person sessions separated by participant group.   Results: Thirty-one participants including patients with breast cancer, breast cancer patient navigators and patient navigator administrators from Western Pennsylvania participated. During brainstorming, 121 non-unique items were generated. These statements were combined into one master list of 85 items. After the sorting and rating step, the 85 items were grouped into a six-cluster concept map. Through the group consensus process during the interpretation sessions, the six clusters were named. Diagrams produced by participants noted that all the identified components were essential to patient navigation, but Skills to Build Trust and Patient Centered Relationships and Maintain Professional, Positive and Thoughtful Communication and Care were the most impactful components for promoting the patient-navigator relationship. Results of the rating step showed no notable differences between groups with participants rating Empathetic, Comprehensive and Compassionate Support, Bridge to Clinical Education and Supportive Resources, and Ongoing Individualized Coordination of Care as the most important components for facilitating the patient-navigator relationship.   Conclusion: These findings have both identified and operationalized the emerging interpersonal skills and behaviors of patient navigators in breast cancer care. These identified components can inform the patient navigation role description, competencies, and the development of curriculum for training and metrics for evaluation.

T1  - Life Choices of Emerging Adults in India
AN  - 2157970676
AB  - Emerging adulthood is marked by important decisions about life choices. These life choices have their roots in sociocultural and historical conditions. The present study used a mixed methodology, concept mapping, to understand the tasks that are deemed as important by emerging adults in India. Study 1 comprised 5 focus group discussions with individuals between 18 to 29 years (N = 40, Mage = 23) providing insights on the range of life choices. Study 2  (N = 60,  Mage = 23) incorporated rating and sorting methodologies to derive cluster maps. Eight clusters emerged. In order of importance: Responsibility towards Family, Independence/Autonomy, Financial Security, Education/Career, Parental Expectations, Romantic Relationships, Community and Faith, and Societal Norms. Influences on decision making of these life choices included self, others, circumstantial, and external. Findings have implications for positive identity formation, eudemonic happiness, and overall wellbeing.

T1  - Examining the Causes of Militant Terrorism in the Delta Region of Nigeria
AN  - 2129663388
AB  - Militancy in the Niger Delta area of Nigeria is a problem that affects government, private organizations, and individuals. The government’s Amnesty and Reconciliation Program encouraged individuals to denounce militancy in return for skills training and a monthly allowance. However, the amnesty program has not yielded the desired result of ending insurgent militancy. The purpose of this research was to better understand factors that cause individuals to join militant groups in the Niger Delta region, in order to proffer plausible solutions to address the causes of militancy. Using the root cause conceptual framework in this phenomenological research, I explored the causal factors of militancy in the Niger Delta region for an in-depth understanding of this phenomenon. The key research questions focused on the motivating factors that spur individuals to participate in militant terrorism in Nigeria’s Niger Delta region and whether the implementation of the Amnesty and Reconciliation Program mitigated the problem of militant terrorism in Nigeria’s Niger Delta. Data were collected from 10 individuals through in-depth face-to-face interviews, while concept mapping was applied in completing the analysis of interview data. Key results revealed 8 core areas as causes of militancy: the lack of local control of resources, underdevelopment, relocation of local government headquarters, poverty, marginalization, environmental pollution, education opportunities, and poor implementation of the amnesty program. Implications for positive social change include using the findings to develop more effective programs and policies for addressing the problem of militancy and to implement strategies that will reduce or eradicate militancy and associated problems.

T1  - Exploring clinical learning environments for postgraduate medical education
AN  - 2117835097
AB  - Background: The premise that trainees learn through work underpins the design of postgraduate medical education (PGME). The clinical learning environment (CLE) is the foundation of PGME and represents the social, cultural and physical context wherein trainees learn through supervised patient encounters. Social theories of learning emphasise the role of the environment in workplace learning which, in PGME, occurs through trainee participation and engagement in the daily work of a doctor. There is a gap in the existing literature about priorities and challenges in clinical environments. Consequently, frontline practitioners and stakeholders in PGME may be at a loss about where to focus their efforts to improve trainee learning. Further exploration of clinical learning environments is needed to support the appropriate targeting of effort and resources, to achieve maximum impact. Supervisors are central to workplace learning in postgraduate medical education. The processes involved in clinical supervision are not fully understood, and limited theory is available that explains how workplace learning occurs through supervisor-trainee interactions. Theoretical explanations about learning through supervisor-trainee interaction and the role of the environment in this process are needed to support improvement. For these reasons, this doctoral research programme aimed to answer two overarching questions; 1) On what aspects of the clinical environment should we focus on to better support trainee learning? And 2) How does supervised workplace learning happen and what is the role of the environment in this process? Methods: This research programme involved three studies situated within the critical realist paradigm. A Group Concept Mapping (GCM) was the first study, to identify the priorities and challenges associated with postgraduate medical education within clinical environments. Findings from Study 1 was used, amongst other things, to narrow the focus of Study 2, a Realist Review of workplace learning that occurs during informal supervisor and trainee interactions. Study 2 produced a Realist Theory which was tested and refined in Study 3 through a Multiple Case Study. 1) Group Concept Mapping is an integrated mixed methods approach to generating expert group consensus. A multidisciplinary group of experts were invited to participate in the GCM process via an online platform. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to analyse participant inputs regarding barriers, facilitators and priorities for trainee learning in clinical environments. 2) Realist Review is an interpretative theory-driven narrative summary of the literature describing how, why, and in what circumstances complex social interventions work. The steps and procedures outlined in the RAMESES Publication Standards for Realist Synthesis were followed and involved the translation of findings from ninety empirical studies into context, mechanism, and outcome configurations. 3) Multiple Case Study is an empirical inquiry that is used to contribute to our knowledge of complex social phenomena and allows preservation of the characteristics of real-world events. Fifty supervisor and trainee participants were interviewed across four clinical departments and specialties. Data analysis were conducted through pattern matching and cross-case analysis within and across the four cases. Results: 1) Group Concept Mapping: Participants identified facilitators and barriers in ten domains within clinical learning environments. Domains rated most important were those which related to trainees’ connection to and engagement with more senior doctors. Organisation and conditions of work and Time to learn with senior doctors during patient care were rated as the most challenging areas in which to make improvements. 2) Realist Review: The realist review described a realist theory of supervised workplace learning categorising three processes; Supervised Participation in Practice, Mutual Observation of Practice and Dialogue about Practice. These processes are underpinned by interrelated mechanisms which are led by supervisor, trainee or both; Entrustment, Support Seeking, Monitoring, Modelling, Meaning Making and Feedback. The results of the review detail how contexts at individual and interpersonal, and local and systems levels, trigger or inhibit these mechanisms and shape their outcomes. These outcomes include both key educational objectives of PGME and safe, high-quality patient care. 3) Multiple Case Study: This study illustrated the context-specificity of supervised workplace learning and indicated that trainees and supervisors experience supervised workplace learning differently across clinical environments, the level of trainee oversight may be excessive (for real-world reasons), and local contexts limit, in particular, the mechanism of Entrustment to generate its intended outcomes. Conclusion: Supervised workplace learning emerges from the context in which it happens. A better understanding of supervised workplace learning and the role of the environment in this process is a critical adjunct to efforts to improve postgraduate medical education. This doctoral thesis generated a deeper insight into supervised workplace learning and how to contextualise, through the components of clinical learning environments, the mechanisms and outcomes of this social phenomenon. Layers of contexts shape how trainees learn with, from and about supervisors. At the centre is the supervisor-trainee relationship; at a higher level, local and systems contexts compounding, even more, the complexity of this relationship. The final output of the synthesised literature and empirically tested and refined realist theory contributes to a more consistent conceptualisation of trainee learning through supervisor interaction. The detailed information presented in this thesis about the process of supervised workplace learning including its contexts and outcomes will allow supervisors, trainees, researchers, policymakers, and managers to appraise postgraduate medical education and have a better chance to make improvements successfully.

T1  - The Effect of Concept Mapping on Baccalaureate Nursing Students' Knowledge Acquisition
AN  - 2117024956
AB  - This dissertation is a series of three papers on the effect of concept mapping on baccalaureate nursing students’ knowledge acquisition. The first paper is an integrative review of the literature on the use of concept mapping in nursing education. The review evidences that concept mapping has been effective in nursing education for increasing students’ critical thinking. However, it shows that no studies addressing the level of nursing knowledge gained using concept mapping were identified, indicating a need for research in the area of the use of concept mapping for nursing knowledge acquisition. The second paper is a feasibility study of the methodological approaches proposed for a research study on the effect of concept mapping on nursing knowledge acquisition of nursing students. It affirms that the proposed methods of teaching concept mapping and scoring concept maps using the Concept Map Structural Scoring Method are feasible and appropriate for such a research study. The third paper is a report of the research study undertaken on the effect of concept mapping on baccalaureate nursing students’ knowledge acquisition. This study reveals that utilizing concept mapping along with lecture appears to help improve baccalaureate students ‘nursing knowledge acquisition, although further research is needed.

T1  - Efficiently Comparing Mental Representations: Visualizing and Matching Causal Networks
AN  - 2115856614
AB  - A concept map can be used to represent knowledge. A causal map is a type of concept map and a graphical way that can be used to define thinking of an individual about a system by using links between nodes in a network to represent causation or influence. A causal map thus can be used to solve ill-structured problems and evaluate student's assignment. Causal maps can also be used to generate feedback for a student by comparing it with an expert map. However, exact network comparison is an NP-complete problem and is known to be graph isomorphism problem.   In order to solve the problem, an online platform is created, where instead of exact graph comparison mathematical techniques such as graph edit distance, graph kernel, and graph embedding are used to measure how closely two networks match. Before performing comparison it is important to establish a common set of terms between two networks, as a student term might have a slight variations in the way they name the included concepts in causal map. This requires alignment of terms which is often contextual, the process is eased by implementing a recommendation system by leveraging alignments done by other users. Step by step feedback is generated to guide the student in developing their understanding of a system. This software can be used in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) and classroom-based system, where assessing the learning experience and providing feedback to a large number of participants is an ongoing challenge.

T1  - Equine-Assisted Activities and Therapies for Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders
AN  - 2115833529
AB  - Objective: The purpose of this dissertation is to systematically map, and then advance, the state of scientific and theoretical development of equine-assisted activities and therapies (EAATs) for children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD).    Method: This dissertation is composed of two studies. The first study was a systematic mapping review of peer-reviewed literature relevant to EAATs for children with ASD. In conjunction with my research team, I gathered peer-reviewed literature pertaining to EAATs for children with ASD, and extracted information from each paper about scientific methods, participants, interventions, theory, and outcomes. Guided by the results of the first study, the second study was a mixed-method investigation of occupational therapy in an equine environment (OTee). The quantitative strand consisted of a multiple-baseline single-case experimental design, investigating the efficacy of OTee  on occupational performance, behavior, and social functioning of eight children with ASD. The qualitative strand adopted a generic qualitative research approach; I conducted interviews with two occupational therapists, aimed at elucidating the theoretical rationale guiding OTee for children with ASD.    Results: In the systematic mapping review, five types of equine-assisted activities were identified across 25 studies, with reported improvements in behavior, social interaction, and communication. Four types of equine-assisted therapies were identified across eight studies, with reported improvements in motor control and self-care. Different approaches to therapeutic riding and hippotherapy, the most studied interventions, were evident. Theoretical linkages among change mechanisms, intervention designs incorporating horses, and outcomes were rare. Explanatory formal theories and possible change mechanisms were more prevalent. Guided by findings, we propose that a) equine movement, manipulated by a therapist, challenges and improves postural control, and that an equine-assisted activity or therapy can, b) promote engagement, a platform for social development, and c) provide structured support for social interaction and positively reinforce communication. While promising, these three nascent theoretical frameworks merit further critique, testing and refinement.    In study 2, children with ASD who received 10 weeks of OTee demonstrated improvements in individualized occupational performance goals, social communication, and social motivation. Some, but not all, participants also demonstrated a decrease in hyperactive and irritable behaviors. Children did not demonstrate significant changes in social cognition, social awareness, or restricted and repetitive behaviors. Occupational therapists portrayed OTee as a holistic intervention that provides children with opportunities to learn and practice a variety of skills within a motivating context where children are purposefully engaged in equine-related occupations. Derived from interview data, a concept map of therapists’ clinical reasoning delineates hypothesized mechanisms of change, including the role of the horse, that lead to improvements in the following outcomes: a) cognitive skills, b) motor skills, c) attention and engagement during therapy, d) social interaction, e) communication, f) behavior, and g) safety. Qualitative results elucidated specific mechanisms and intervention components that may have led to improved occupational performance, behavior, and social functioning in the quantitative strand.    Conclusion: Peer-reviewed literature pertaining to EAATs for children with ASD is in early stages of scientific and theoretical development. Promising outcomes support continued investigation focused on conceptual development and testing of theoretical frameworks, standardization, appropriateness, and efficacy. One type of EAAT, OTee, is a highly individualized intervention that requires clinical reasoning to incorporate the unique affordances of the equine environment into individualized occupational therapy; when tailored to the individual needs of children with ASD, OTee may improve occupational performance, hyperactivity, irritability, social communication, and social motivation.

T1  - Understanding Information Search Processes in the Context of Academic Literature Searches
AN  - 2091533725
AB  - Current search engines and information retrieval systems have made extraordinary progress towards interpreting and answering well-defined, direct questions. However, they are often unsatisfactory for assisting users with less well-defined information needs that often occur within an academic context. Examining students’ search goals and search behaviors can provides insight into information search strategies and tactics. Understanding these behaviors can also help inform the design of search systems in order to better present information to users with these types of information needs. This research examines case studies of graduate students conducting academic literature searches. Screen recordings and individually coded interactions were qualitatively analyzed for emergent search behaviors and evolution of goal refinement while searching for information on a broad topic of interest. Student concept maps representing their visual organization of the documents they found were compared to topic maps algorithmically generated from the same documents. Findings from observations of participants’ search sessions are distilled into a set of design recommendations for search systems that can be applied to better address the needs of those searching for academic publications and information.

T1  - Exploring Nursing Instructors' Experiences With Implementing Concept Maps in the Classroom
AN  - 2086420585
AB  - Concept mapping is an active learning strategy found to be beneficial to nursing students. A gap in the literature was present regarding faculty experiences with implementing concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to investigate the experience of nursing instructors in the classroom setting who routinely used concept mapping in teaching their nursing courses. The sample consisted of eight participants who held at least a master’s degree in nursing and taught in one of the two-year community college nursing programs in the Northeastern United States. The study entailed the use of six guided interview questions in semi-structured format and using a constant comparative approach to data analysis, which led to the development of three themes. The initial experiences with concept maps theme addressed how nursing instructors became aware of concept mapping. The experiences related to implementing concept maps theme addressed positive and negative issues related to the practice of implementing concept maps. The experiences of nursing faculty were associated with factors that promoted meaningful learning for their students leading to the final theme of promoting meaningful learning, which was further supported by three subthemes. The critical thinking subtheme addressed the benefit of concept maps among students in developing higher cognitive thinking. The connecting the classroom to the clinical setting  subtheme addressed students’ use of concept maps in interconnecting information taught in class within the clinical learning environment. The  understanding nursing content subtheme indicated that nursing students had a better comprehension of information with the development of concept maps. One implication to current practice includes nursing faculty to add concept mapping in the classroom setting, which improves learner’s ability to add new knowledge to that they already have and begin to interconnect all information thereby promoting meaningful learning. Future research recommendations include studies on the training of faculty, the timing with implementing concept maps, using a larger sample size, and to conduct a study outside of the community college setting. Future quantitative studies could address the congruency between the subthemes of critical thinking and understanding nursing content. A final recommendation is to conduct a mixed-method study to quantify nursing instructors’ experiences using concept mapping.

T1  - Concept Analysis of Dispositional Humility in Professionals and Expanding the Understanding of the Concept in a Multidisciplinary Primary Care Environment: A Mixed Methods Study
AN  - 2085253516
AB  - Dispositional humility of healthcare professionals balances self-centered occupational drive and the needs of other professionals, and may contribute to effective collaboration. After the concept of dispositional humility was analyzed by a literature review, a study surveying dispositional profiles and attitudes toward integrative medicine was conducted among primary care professionals working in interdisciplinary community-based healthcare clinics. In this exploratory sequential mixed method design study, the initial phase of quantitative survey was followed up by the qualitative study of individual interviews which was analyzed by directed content analysis.    It was observed that the: 1) honesty-humility trait (p < 0.01), conscientiousness (p < 0.01), and openness (p < 0.05) of primary care clinicians were statistically significantly higher than the reference norms of collage students; 2) attitudes toward integrative medicine were not different among the three different clinician types with different professional healthcare training backgrounds and credentials (MD/DO, NP, ND); and 3) the summative coding counted themes such as 'patient-centeredness' (other-oriented rather than self-oriented), 'humility', and 'trust', that were considered as attributes of dispositional humility. The directed content analysis identified the dynamic elements of the concept map of dispositional humility, which theoretically connected to functional collaboration among professionals.    Dispositional humility allows clinicians to have an accurate self-assessment, be open to new ideas, appreciate the contribution of others, and develop generosity. Dispositional humility in leaders can facilitate character development of team members and create an environment characterized by fairness and equality, transparency, non-punitive consequences for reporting errors and near-misses, and a safe and encouraging environment for performing work. However, dispositional humility must be nurtured and developed through professional training because high educational attainment, career and financial success, and busy schedules may lead to a sense of self-importance and entitlement that can promote separation of team members into hierarchies based on professional disciplines and specialties. To maintain high quality patient care while working as a team, limiting self-interest while focusing on the needs of others may be necessary and in the best interest of patients. People who display high levels of honesty-humility as well as conscientiousness tend to place trust in other people and act themselves as trustworthy individuals.

T1  - Thriving in a Fortune 500 Company: A Case Study of Grit, Resilience, and Employee Perceptions
AN  - 2080377880
AB  - A qualitative case study was conducted to document 12 employees' perceptions of thriving in a Fortune 500 Company. The case study enabled the researcher to explore the perceptions of thriving among employees with varying levels of grit and resilience using maximum variation sampling strategy. The grit and resilience of these employees had been previously measured through a 14-item Adversity Quotient (AQ) Profile and a10-item Grit Gauge (GG) assessment. Through analysis of interviews, concept maps, and a ranking exercise the researcher was able to identify the most critical factors that lead to thriving in the Fortune 500 Company. The factors include: positive connections, support of family, support of co-workers and others, shared passion, a sense of resolve and determination, and time for self and others. Additional findings from the research were documented and recommendations were made for leaders of corporate organizations and for further research.

T1  - Stakeholders' Conceptualization of Students' Attitudes and Persistence towards STEM: A Mixed Methods Instrument Development and Validation Study
AN  - 2059866759
AB  - Meeting Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) workforce demands require students to have positive attitudes and persist through the STEM pipeline. There is limited research on reliable and valid instruments that measures non-cognitive skills towards all STEM fields. Tools that have been developed have mostly used traditional scale development process of literature review on current instruments, expert and target group consultations, and peer review to develop and guide the conceptual domain. While this is a well-established and validated approach, it does not, however, build on the ideas of the various stakeholders (educators, researchers, professionals, students, and parents) that are involved at improving the STEM pipeline. Additionally, existing tools primarily use classical test theory (CTT) and factor analysis methods for validation. A structured methodology of Concept Mapping (Trochim, 1989a) was used in this study to develop the conceptual domain of attitudes and persistence via a participatory framework. This involved the STEM community from engagement to participation in research ranging from consultation, to involvement, and to collaboration, to develop the attitude and persistence towards STEM (APT-STEM) instrument. The instrument was validated across the quantitative psychometric frameworks of CTT, item response theory (IRT), and Rasch measurement theory (RMT). The entire study employed the exploratory quantitative priority sequential mixed methods design.    In the first concept mapping phase, a total of 190 different STEM stakeholders built an item pool of 699 attitude ideas and 674 persistence ideas. With the use of nested and parallel sampling of a subset of the initial stakeholder group, these ideas went through a structured and rigorous qualitative and quantitative analysis. The resulting concept maps organized the stakeholder's conceptualization of the attitude and persistence constructs. Using qualitative and psychometric techniques, a total of 30 items were selected and refined to form the APT-STEM instrument.     In the second quantitative phase of validation, APT-STEM was administered to 556 grade 5–12 students from different STEM programs who were a representative sample of the student stakeholder group. The data was analyzed using the psychometric frameworks with IRT and RMT contributing to more diagnostic details about the instrument compared to CTT. The instrument thus developed has items that were different from existing instruments. Stakeholder's conceptualized responsibility, making sacrifices, and continued practice as characteristics of a persistent student who would do well in STEM. Some attitudes that stakeholders conceived as essential were going above and beyond the classroom in pursuit of STEM learning and a belief that STEM helps develop critical thinking skills. Implications for this study include STEM programs at the middle and high school level using this instrument to assess the efficacy of the STEM education programs that change the attitudes and develop persistence towards learning and doing STEM and triggering conversations in classrooms focused on STEM careers and collaborations with STEM professionals.

T1  - The Africa Yoga Project and Wellbeing: A Concept Map of Students' Perceptions
AN  - 2056476142
AB  - Concept mapping methodology was used to explore the perceived impact of practicing yoga with the Africa Yoga Project (AYP)—an organization created to increase health and well-being by providing community based yoga classes throughout Kenya. AYP's mission is discussed in terms of how it fits with theoretical models of well-being. Anecdotal evidence and initial qualitative research suggested the AYP meaningfully impacted adult students. This study constituted a more in-depth investigation of students' experiences. Of the hundreds of AYP's adult students, 56 and 82 students participated in Phases I and II, respectively. Phase I brainstorming resulted in 94 student-generated statements about their perceived change. Phase II participants sorted and rated statements in terms of importance. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of sort data was utilized to map and group statements into clusters. Based on statistical and interpretive criteria, a 5-cluster solution with the following concepts was identified as the best model of students' change: Personal Growth; Interpersonal Effectiveness (lowest importance); Physical and Social Benefits; Emotional Resiliency; and Improved Self-Concept (highest importance). Overall, students reported positive perceptions of the AYP. Additional research is needed to quantify students' change, and to compare the AYP outcomes to those of other programs aimed at poverty related stress reduction and increased well-being.

T1  - Concept Mapping as an Assessment of Cognitive Load and Mental Effort in Complex Problem Solving in Chemistry
AN  - 2047585239
AB  - This research is an exploratory, descriptive study of students’ cognitive load and mental effort related to complex problem solving in high school chemistry. From a cognitive point of view, the complexity associated with problem solving in chemistry can be understood from the context of cognitive load theory (CLT). The objective of this descriptive research using five high school student case studies is to understand the cognitive load phenomena students encounter while learning subject matter that requires complex problem solving, specifically chemical equilibrium. This study employed a mixed methods multiple case study design, in which each participating student (n = 5) is conceptualized as a case. Each student case self-reported their mental effort on eight chemical equilibrium problems. The mean for each students’ mental effort and problem solving was reported. Each student completed an equilibrium concept map which was scored. The concept map scores are reported. The analysis compared mental effort score, quiz score and concept map score. There was an inverse relationship between mental effort and concept map score. The more complex the concept map (higher score) the less mental effort students report using to solve the problems. There was a positive relationship between mental effort score and quiz score; and a negative relationship between concept map score and quiz score. We believe these correlations indicate that the variables are related to cognitive load. Methodologically, we found that concept mapping is a valid assessment of cognitive load and mental effort. We believe that further larger studies are needed to substantiate these findings and explain how concept mapping can be used as a representation of cognitive load and student learning.

T1  - Promoting Meaningful Learning Through the Use of Concept Maps
AN  - 2047546831
AB  - Background and significance: There have been dramatic changes in the healthcare system with the high use of technology. The healthcare needs of patients have increased due to the chronic diseases, and an increase in the number of the older population. These changes require nurses with high levels of thinking, knowledge and skills. It is vital to reconsider the teaching and learning methods used in nursing schools to ensure graduating nurses are capable of working in these challenging environments. The purpose of this naturalistic inquiry descriptive study is to explore the experiences and perspectives of undergraduate and graduate nursing students and faculty on the use of concept maps as a learning tool by students, and as a teaching and assessment tool by faculty at a nursing college in a public university, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. At this stage, meaningful learning is defined as the ability of students to make sense of the content learned in-class, and their ability to recall the information during their exams. Methodology: Undergraduate and graduate nursing students were trained on the creation of concept maps. Faculty were trained on the use of concept maps as a teaching and assessment tool. Using convenient sampling method, the sample included 18 undergraduate students, 4 graduate students, and 4 faculty.  Data was collected using focus groups with students and indepth individual interviews with faculty. Data was analyzed using thematic analysis.  Findings: Three themes were identified; enablers, constraints and guidance and support. Conclusion: The results help faculty learn more about nursing students and understand their learning needs which will influence the faculty's choice of teaching methods when planning for their courses and lessons. The results need to be complemented by empirical evidence on the use of concept maps by Saudi Arabian nursing students and faculty.

T1  - A Grounded Theory of Urinary Incontinence Using a Transcultural Perspective
AN  - 2046899765
AB  - Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is both a common and costly condition confronted in nursing and indeed the healthcare system worldwide. While UI is often considered a natural consequence of aging, there are physiological, psychological, and quality-of-life implications for all of those individuals living with UI. Sadly, UI often is ignored or stigmatized and becomes a taboo issue within most cultures.    Purpose: To better understand UI and develop a definition of significance for nursing and to understand the experience of nurses caring for persons with UI across cultures (China and U.S.) through developing grounded theory, this research was framed using Leininger (1991) Culture Care Diversity and Universality Theory. The dissertation includes three research papers.    Methods: The first study conducted is a concept analysis of urinary incontinence using the techniques of Rodgers (1989, 2000). The second and third studies use Corbin and Strauss' (2008, 2015) grounded theory methods to examine hospital nurses' perceptions as well as the management of UI in China (n=6) and the U.S (n=11). Semi-structured interview format was used to collect data and apply the methods.    Findings: The first study is entitled Urinary Incontinence: A Concept Analysis produced holistic definition that elucidates the nuances and complexities of the patient with UI as well as a concept map. The second study is entitled Perceptions and Management of Patients with Urinary Incontinence Among Chinese Hospital Nurses identified several key themes emerged including the demedicalization of UI, the novice-to-expert trajectory of nurse's in UI care skill acquisition, and general lack of formal education. The study also highlighted the fact that UI is a multifarious issue (core category); there are many etiologies, management modalities, and treatment options. The third study entitled Perceptions and Management of Patients with Urinary Incontinence Among American Hospital Nurses is similar to the qualitative study conducted in China and was developed to allow for a transcultural perspective on the issue to occur. The core category was identified as being the multifarious nature of UI. The themes that emerged were the novice-to-expert trajectory of nurses, age and acceptability of UI, psychological impacts of UI, and lack of education. The three studies were then used to develop a grounded theory of urinary incontinence.    Conclusion: The studies identified diversities and universalities between Chinese and American hospital nurses. The processes of taking action and making sense were elucidated. Finally, a comprehensive model of the nurse's management of the patient with UI is proposed. This grounded theory model synthesizes the concept analysis if UI which highlights the micro-level factors, while the grounded theory studies informed the macroscopic level of processes.

T1  - Evaluating Dental Students' Preferences of the Current Assessment Methods Used in Dental Education and Their Impact on Learning Approaches
AN  - 2038452443
AB  - Assessment is a critical component of the educational experience. The purpose of this study was to examine dental students’ assessment preferences and their relation to students’ approaches to learning. The study also investigates the impact of gender, age, GPA and class level on dental students’ assessment preferences. Two hundred sixteen dental students at University of the Pacific Arthur Dugoni School of Dentistry have completed a self-reported 67-item questionnaire. Open-ended questions requiring long answers were the least preferred assessment method as perceived by the dental students, while multiple-choice questions are the most preferred assessment method. Deep approach to learning was significantly and positively correlated with oral test, alternative test, concept map, open-ended questions and questions that require higher order thinking. Surface approach to learning, however, was not significantly correlated with any assessment type. Age, gender, GPA and class level all have significant impact on dental students’ assessments preferences.

T1  - The Effects of Nursing Program Simulation Experience Level and Type of Advanced Organizer on Clinical Judgment Performance, Satisfaction, Self-Confidence, and Perceived Cognitive Load of Pre-Licensure Nursing Students in Simulation Based Learning
AN  - 2033473659
AB  - Nursing education programs face many challenges with training students to become professional nurses who will practice safely in an evolving and complex healthcare system. Nurse educators are obliged to prepare students to meet these challenges, with clinical experience being a key aspect of training. However, limited availability of clinical sites restricts adequate training. Simulation based learning (SBL) activities that mimic real world environments are now transforming the clinical experience, however, research is limited and additional research is needed.   By understanding the demand of cognitive load during SBL, nurse educators can design simulation activities that promote positive outcomes. Advanced organizers (AO) are one way of assisting students to retain information and aid recall. Therefore, this study focused on the effects of AO and participant Nursing Program Simulation (NPS) experience level on clinical judgment performance, satisfaction and self-confidence, and perception of CL during SBL. This study used a mixed methods sequential research design and examined 99 students enrolled in an associate degree nursing program. Participants were enrolled in  one of three courses which used SBL.   Students were assigned to comparison groups based on their course level and assigned clinical instructor. Participants were given a mnemonic or a concept map during the SBL pre-briefing phase. A pretest simulation was completed followed by a posttest simulation within a 12-week period to assess for differences in clinical judgment performance. Students were given questionnaires post simulation to determine perception of satisfaction and self-confidence, as well as determine their perceived cognitive load. A focus group interview was conducted post simulation to identify additional emerging themes.   Quantitative analysis showed NPS experienced students had higher clinical judgment performance pretest-posttest scores than NPS novice students. There was an interaction between the combined effects of NPS experience level and type of AO showed NPS experienced students had higher scores with the use of a concept map over a mnemonic, whereas the NPS novice group showed no difference. The analysis found NPS novice group participants had higher perceived satisfaction and self-confidence with the use of a mnemonic, whereas the NPS experienced students had higher perceived satisfaction and self-confidence with a concept map. NPS novice group students had a higher perceived cognitive load with the use of a concept map compared to a mnemonic, but the NPS experienced group showed no differences. Qualitative results showed NPS novice participants seemed to feel more comfortable and satisfied with the use of the mnemonic as a memory aid. Conversely the NPS experienced group seemed more self-confident with the use of a concept map. Therefore, the selection of instructional strategies are important for educators to consider when developing SBL experiences.

T1  - Incorporating Concept Mapping into the Debriefing Phase of Simulated Patient Care: A Study of Knowledge Gains in Baccalaureate Nursing Students
AN  - 2033422476
AB  - Human patient simulation is becoming a critical component of nursing curricula within baccalaureate programs across the nation. Human patient simulation as a form of guided learning for patient care has been implemented in nursing education for many years. The approach to learning serves to guide nursing students in their quest to develop their critical thinking related to patient care. The debriefing phase of human patient simulation has long been touted as one of the defined phases of learning, yet a standardized method of debriefing may benefit learning. The purpose of this quantitative, experimental study was to implement concept mapping as a strategy to structure the debriefing phase of simulation. The treatment group received concept mapping debriefing, while the control group received usual and customary debriefing. Concept mapping was used to guide learners, and to provide structure to the human patient simulation debriefing. A repeated measures knowledge test was used to assess knowledge gains in both groups of learners. The treatment group received concept mapping during debriefing. The control group received conversational debriefing. The sample consisted of 63 baccalaureate students enlisted in a medical-surgical nursing course at one university in the United States. Ordinary least squares analysis revealed a significant difference in knowledge gains for the treatment group. The concept mapping group demonstrated higher gain scores from the period of pretest to the period of posttest than did the control group. The conclusion of this study underpins the strength of utilizing concept mapping as a useful strategy to structure and guide learning during the debriefing phase of human patient simulation.

T1  - Effects of Analogy, Advance Organiser and Elaborative Interrogation on Achievement and Attitude to Chemistry Among Students in Abia State, Nigeria
AN  - 2700779960
AB  - The field of Chemistry is vital to human existence as many of its theories and concepts can be applied in diverse areas of human endeavour. However the dwindling achievement and poor attitude of secondary school students in Nigeria to Chemistry are of concern to stake holders. These negative attitudes and poor achievement in Chemistry may partly be due to teachers’ method of instructional delivery. This study investigated the effects of Analogy, Advance Organiser and Elaborative Interrogation in improving achievement and attitude to Chemistry among secondary school students in Abia state, Nigeria. Theories of meaningful learning, levels of processing and social learning guided the study which utilised quasi experimental pre-test post-test control group research design. The population comprised of all Senior Secondary School two (S.S.II) Chemistry students in Abia state. Multistage sampling process was used to select 153 S.S II students from four intact classes in four co-educational secondary schools. Students in each of the three schools were exposed to one of the three treatment conditions: Analogy, Advance Organiser and Elaborative Interrogation Instructional Packages while those in the fourth school were the control group and were taught with the traditional Teacher Directed Conventional Instructional Package. Two instruments: Learner’s Achievement Test in Chemistry (LATC) and Learner’s Attitude Questionnaire in Chemistry (LAQC) were used to obtain pre-test and post-test data for the study which lasted nine weeks. Six hypotheses were tested and the data collected were analysed at .05 level of significance using ANCOVA. Four of the six hypotheses formulated were accepted while two were rejected. Results showed that of the three treatment conditions, Advance Organiser was most effective in improving students’ achievement in Chemistry followed by Elaborative Interrogation and Analogy. However on students’ attitude to Chemistry, the most effective instructional strategy was Analogy followed by Elaborative Interrogation and Advance Organiser. Gender and age did not moderate the treatment effects on students’ achievement and attitude to Chemistry. Overall, the instructional strategies were effective in improving students’ achievement and attitude to Chemistry irrespective of the age and gender of the participants. To change students’ negative attitudes to Chemistry and improve their Chemistry achievement, it was recommended that teachers should use Analogy and Advance Organiser in teaching Chemistry, more so that these instructional strategies are not moderated by age and gender.

T1  - Assessing the Effectiveness of Mechanistic Concept Mapping in Case-Based Collaborative Learning
AN  - 2512408335
AB  - Mechanistic Concept Mapping (MCM) is a visual method of representing linkages between concepts in order to facilitate deeper understanding of physiological and pathophysiological principles while solving clinical problems. Case-based collaborative learning (CBCL) is a medium-size group approach that combines elements from team-based, problem-based and case-based learning. This study evaluates the effectiveness of MCM in CBCL at Harvard Medical School. 
First year medical and dental students (n=170) were assigned into one of four learning societies. One society (n=43) was randomly selected for the “MCM” group; the students in the other three societies (n=127) were in the “Control” group. Outcomes for the “MCM” and the “Control” group were compared using student responses to pre-, post-course surveys and exam scores. A qualitative self-assessment focused on students’ perception on their learning was collected mid-course and examined using category construction and inductive approach to analysis.
Overall, “MCM” students’ perceptions of their reasoning skills and teamwork was significantly (p<0.05) better than their “Control” counterparts.  A trend (p=0.08) was noted in “MCM” students’ higher perceptions on their tolerance of ambiguity when compared pre- and post-course responses. The course final exam scores for “MCM” and “Control” groups were not significantly different. However, students’ scores on the first quiz in the “MCM” group tended to be higher than the “Control” group (p=0.09). Qualitative data analysis indicates that students in the “MCM” group routinely overcame team learning obstacles through strategies aimed at prioritizing collaborative inductive reasoning. 
MCM is an easily applicable learning tool that can promote the students’ perceptions of critical thinking skills and teamwork in collaborative learning.

T1  - Towards Plurilingualism in Montreal French Schools: A Critical Discourse Analysis of Current Governmental and School Board Policies
AN  - 2506276046
AB  - Many studies demonstrate that plurilingual practices in an educational setting have positive advantages on the social and cognitive development of a child. Initiatives within Québec research fields demonstrate that paying attention to language awareness and plurilingualism can facilitate the learning of French. Nonetheless, it is rare for Montréal French public schools to encourage these approaches. The socio-historical evolution of the province demonstrates that after a continuous fight to get French recognized as the language of the public sphere, legislation was used as a tool to ensure the learning of French by newly arrived immigrants as well as to improve the quality of French language-use among all Quebecers. Today, the Charter of the French Language1 dictates measures that school boards must take to assure the vitality of the French language. These measures are articulated in language policies that are elaborated in each school board.
This study seeks to identify and better understand the facilitators and barriers of plurilingualism. Through a Critical Discourse analysis of the discourse in governmental and the Commission Scolaire de Montréal policies, this study aims to better understand the gap between the equity and cultural valorization discourse in policy and the unilingual practice currently privileged in Québec schools. The research will be used to inform school educators about ways to support education for plurilingualism in current educational policy, encourage education stakeholders to engage in professional self-development about education for plurilingualism, and offer equitable recommendations.Alternate abstract:Plusieurs études démontrent que les pratiques plurilingues ont des avantages positifs sur le développement social et cognitif d'un enfant.  Plusieurs initiatives de recherche au Québec démontrent aussi qu'accorder une importance particulière à l'ouverture aux langues et au plurilinguisme peut faciliter l'apprentissage du français. Cependant, il est plutôt rare que les écoles publiques franco-montréalaises encouragent ce type d'approche. Le parcours historique de la province démontre qu'après avoir milité longuement pour faire reconnaitre le français comme langue commune, une loi assez musclée a été créée afin de perpétuer l'apprentissage du français chez les populations d'accueil et améliorer la qualité de la langue chez les Québécois de souche. La Charte de la langue française dicte aujourd'hui les mesures que doivent mettre en œuvre les commissions scolaires pour assurer la vitalité du français. Ces mesures sont articulées dans des politiques linguistiques qui sont propres à chacune des commissions scolaires.
Cette étude vise à mieux comprendre et identifier les facilitateurs et les barrières au plurilinguisme. Avec une analyse critique du discours intégré dans les politiques gouvernementales et des commissions scolaires montréalaises, j'aspire à mieux comprendre le hiatus entre les discours d'équité et de valorisation culturelle de cette commission et les pratiques unilingues actuellement privilégiées à l'école. Le but de cette étude est d'informer les éducateurs au sujet des facilitateurs du plurilinguisme dans les politiques en place, d'encourager les intervenants en milieu scolaire à participer à des activités de perfectionnement professionnel et d'offrir des recommandations équitables qui respectent les droits de la personne afin d'informer la révision de la politique.

T1  - Conceptions of Education, Leadership, and Citizenship: Student Leadership Development for Global Citizenship
AN  - 2504400632
AB  - The purpose of education, as suggested by John Dewey (1916), is to equip every individual with knowledge and experience so they enter life post-graduation as engaged and informed citizens. University provides educational experiences that challenge students and ready them to serve as contributing members of diverse communities. Considering the the 21st century context and the complex issues present around the world, universities should educate, prepare, and empower students to resolve problems in society. This research applies a phenomenographic research approach to explore university students' conceptions of education, leadership, and citizenship. Data reveals that participants found these three themes to converge toward global citizenship, which comprises of six conceptions, including international participation, cross-cultural understanding, humanity, community contributions, travel zones for educational exchange, and world rights. These data offer recommendations for how to integrate global citizenship themes into student leadership development programming and educational opportunities that are relevant, challenging, and fulfilling for international undergraduate students of the 21st century.Alternate abstract:Le but de l'éducation, suggéré par John Dewey (1916), est d'équiper chaque personne avec les compétences et les expériences pour qu'elle entre dans la société. Grâce à leur éducation, ces nouveaux citoyens seraient engagés et éclairés. L'université fournit aux étudiants les opportunités éducatives qui les stimulent et les préparent à devenir des membres des communautés. En considérant le contexte du 21e siècle et les problèmes complexes qui existent dans le monde entier, les universités doivent éduquer, préparer, et responsabiliser les étudiants à résoudre les problèmes de société. Cette recherche utilise une méthodologie qui s'appelle « phenomenography » pour découvrir les conceptions de l'éducation, le leadership, et la citoyenneté chez les étudiants internationaux. Les résultats montrent que ces participants ont trouvé que ces trois thèmes convergent vers l'idée de « global citizenship », ou la citoyenneté appliquée au monde entier. « Global citizenship » inclus six conceptions, comme la participation à l'international, l'appréciation des cultures différentes, l'humanité, la contribution aux communautés, l'échange entre des personnes pour les éduquer, et les droites humains mondiales. Cette recherche offre des recommandations pour intégrer ces conceptions de « global citizenship » dans les programmes de développement pour les étudiants à faire progresser leur leadership. Avec l'intégration de ces résultats, les programmes de développement seraient plus pertinents, stimulants, et satisfaisants pour les étudiants internationaux actuels.

T1  - Getting to Know QM(s): Exploring the Actor-Networks of Quantitative Methods Across Higher Education Social Science Subjects
AN  - 2484861292
AB  - In the UK, the need for more quantitatively-skilled citizens and employees has been widely publicised. This skills deficit has prompted a wide range of policy initiatives and academic research into quantitative methods (QM(s)) learning-teaching across all levels of education. Although the academic literature has provided useful insights into the learning-teaching of QM(s), it has overlooked key questions concerning the character of QM(s) across Social Science disciplines and the role of non-human actors. This thesis begins to fill this gap in the literature by adopting Actor-Network Theory (ANT) to explore the learning-teaching of QM(s) within four Higher Education Social Science subjects. To investigate the actor-networks that QM(s) is comprised of, and located within, an assemblage of methods was used, including: semi-structured interviews, concept mapping, participant observation and document analysis. Together, these methods capture QM(s) across Harvey’s (2004) three spaces (abstract, relative, and relational), supplementing ANT’s own relational understanding of space(-time). Challenging the passive and singular framings of QM(s), presented within policy initiatives and the literature, here, QM(s) was found to be a character occupying multiple positions of agency, taught content, and locations on participants’ concept maps. Within the teaching-learning environments, the construction of QM(s) as linear, fixed and learnt through doing was translated by worksheets and correct answers, producing a characterisation of QM(s) as a passive, linear activity of completing tests. When placed within disciplinary actor-networks, QM(s) was identified as performing a variety of roles: providing patterns/trends; offering reliable answers and predictions; aiding theory testing; and assisting decision-making. However, these positionings were being challenged by new techniques, software, and learning-teaching environments. These findings imply that instead of a focus on differentiating QM(s) knowledge, to successfully integrate QM(s) with disciplinary knowledges attention should be given to QM(s’) link to data and theoretical positionings. Overall, this thesis provides an original contribution to knowledge through its adoption of ANT, a theory not before applied to QM(s) learning-teaching research. In doing this, it challenges common assumptions made within the literature to provide new insights into the character of QM(s) and the role of previously overshadowed non-human actors.

T1  - Knowledge Graph Creation from Structure Knowledge
AN  - 2447865785
AB  - Knowledge graphs, which organize and structure knowledge by linked concepts, have been widely used as teaching and learning tools for science education tasks. Typically, they are manually created by domain experts to serve as “ontology” or “knowledge base” for different purposes. However, with the tremendous growth of massive online educational data, automating the creation of concept maps becomes necessary. The task is challenging as it requires not only extracting domain concepts from educational content but also identifying the semantic relations among them. This thesis proposes to perform concept map extraction from high-quality academic resources, such as textbooks and research papers, inside of which more meaningful structures and semantics can be leveraged. Moreover, we leverage other types of structure knowledge such as web knowledge bases to help create the concept map. With rich semantic information and a large-scale hyperlink network, it has been widely used in learning and education. We first present a work on concept hierarchy extraction using rich structure in textbooks. However, this work did not explicitly identify concept relations embedded in the textbooks. To resolve this, we perform joint optimization for concept extraction and prerequisite relations identification using rich book structures. In the last work, instead of only being interested in the prerequisites, we aim to extract a concept map with multiple types of relationships, such as “is-a’ and “has-part”. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves the state-of-the-art concept map extraction result on concept maps, manually created from six textbooks. Lastly, this thesis performs some pilot studies on using the automatically extracted concept map for educational purposes. Two systems are introduced in this thesis. One is BBookx - an automatic textbook creation system; Another is an automatic assessment system using prerequisite concept maps.

T1  - Questioning the grade: understanding the complexity of student grade enquiries in higher education
AN  - 2083755094
AB  - This thesis investigates the perceptions and attitudes of undergraduates and academics towards grading within one UK university. It explores requests for grade uplift by investigating actual, perceived and anticipated student demands in an increasingly market-driven higher education sector. The phenomenon of ‘grade grubbing’, whereby students demand an uplift of their grades, has been identified as a symbol of marketisation and the student-ascustomer. There has been little formal research on this topic, however, particularly in a UK context although there is more discussion about grade grubbing in the US. A mixed methods approach involving the use of questionnaires, focus groups, interviews and concept mapping was used, together with an extensive literature review of marketisation as a key concept, in order to gather empirical evidence about attitudes to grade appeals. The perspectives of undergraduate students and academic staff were sought and compared. The key finding is that forms of student behaviour labelled as grade grubbing have been over-simplified and misunderstood. Whilst the student voice indicates a consumerist attitude towards the student experience, grade grubbing itself, when defined as seeking an uplift in the initial grade awarded, is rare. Students are much more likely to accept the grades they receive at face value and not question them (grade neutral) or seek more feedback to understand the grade awarded (grade enquiry). They also, less commonly, challenge academic judgment (grade challenge) or demand a higher grade (grade grubbing). Whilst there are no short cuts to minimising grade enquiries, a review of the landscape affords a more fine-grained understanding of this phenomenon which should be known, less pejoratively, as grade enquiry. The study concludes with future research recommendations to inform university policy.

T1  - In Search of Three-dimensional Learning: Using Self-study to Change a Secondary Biology Teacher's Practice
AN  - 2036831480
AB  - The purpose of this research project was to provide a model for traditional teachers who want to change their practice using self-study research when professional development is unavailable.  Issues and tensions that arise when transitioning from a traditionally taught secondary biology unit to a unit that is more in alignment with the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are explored.  Data collection included using field notes, critical friend’s conversations and feedback, video and audio recordings, Educators Evaluating the Quality of Instructional Products (EQuIP) rubric unit evaluations, self-study personal history and class portrait, concept maps, tag clouds, and student work.  Data analysis compared the changes in practice that occurred between the enactment of a traditionally taught secondary biology unit, and an instructional unit developed by Project NEURON at the University of Illinois.  Changes in teacher understanding of the NGSS, classroom dynamics, curricular alignment with the NGSS, and three-dimensional learning are discussed.  The self-study concludes that teacher change can occur using in-depth, critical reflections on practice.  Traditional teachers who want to transition to the NGSS and three-dimensional instruction can benefit from the findings of this study.  Tensions and issues surrounding science education reforms can give valuable insights to science educators in anticipation of the transition to the NGSS.

T1  - Improving Scientific Literacy Through Reading Strategies: An Action Research Study
AN  - 2021797283
AB  - The purpose of this quantitative action research study is to examine a Scientific Reading Intervention Model (SRIM) with students enrolled in Honors Chemistry at a private high school in South Carolina. Students were given a pre-test prior to the intervention. The research took place over a six-week period in the spring of 2017. A teacher-participant worked with the researcher-participant to implement the intervention that consisted of three reading activities—pre-reading, during-reading, and post-reading. These three activities were designed to enable the low-level science readers to better comprehend their chemistry texts by activating prior knowledge with an anticipation guide, identifying key concepts through coding and connecting facts to comprehend a big picture by constructing concept maps. Students were given a post-test at the end of the unit and a simple t-test was used to analyze the pre-test and post-test data. Other data collection included semi-structured interviews with the teacher-participant and the student-participants as well as classroom observations during the implementation of the unit. Findings include reading strategies for chemistry students. An action plan includes teacher in-service for science faculty as well as implementation of a modified SRIM at the school in the fall of 2017.

T1  - A sysematic inquiry on global engineering education: Strategies and impact
AN  - 2013162611
AB  - Higher education has increasingly emphasized global education programming as a core piece of its strategic goals over the past few decades, yet little empirical data has been collected to inform the decisions of global programming within the U.S, especially in the engineering discipline. As higher education institutions attempt to formalize their strategies for achieving global competency and invest in internationalizing their engineering programs, research is needed regarding: (1) key global engineering education target areas and their relationship to sustained global programming efforts; (2) programming directions that can be used by universities in general and engineering schools in particular; and (3) how effective programming contributes to students’ global competency development. Three separate studies framed in different analytical lenses are employed to address these research objectives.    The first study uses a participatory, integrative mixed-methods approach to develop an operational framework for global strategies, policies, and programs. A thematic, qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with a group concept mapping activity was conducted with directors of study abroad and vice provosts of global education from nine universities regarding their global programming strategies, intended outcomes, and organizational resources that support the internationalization process.   Global engineering education research has grown increasingly complex, and of particular importance is related to engineering students’ global perspectives. The second study applies finite mixture models to characterize engineering students’ global perspective development patterns. Further, the relationship among global perspective patterns, student backgrounds and prior international experiences is explored.    The third study employs data envelopment analysis to investigate how engineering students utilize international experiences in college and the relative efficiency of students’ global perspective development. The results are used to identify which international experiences get the most “bang for your buck” and how engineering programs can tailor their international experiences to their student populations.    The results of this research provide both implicit and explicit engineering school-wide global programming strategies and their sustainable development. Triangulating the results from each study informs international engineering education policy makers and scholars, and provides actionable information for program directors to further educate engineering student populations for the 21st century.

T1  - Pura Vida: Teacher Experiences in a Science Education Study Abroad Course in Costa Rica
AN  - 2006913605
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of classroom teachers who participated in a science-focused study abroad during their time as a preservice teacher and to explore how they are using their study abroad experiences in science curriculum planning and in classroom instruction. This study is guided by two research questions: 1) what are the study abroad experiences that have influenced classroom teachers; and, 2) how do classroom teachers incorporate study abroad experiences into science curriculum planning and instruction in the classroom?    Participants were two in-service science teachers from schools located in the Southwestern United States. The participants were enrolled in the course, Environmental Science and Multicultural Experience for K-8 Teachers offered through the Department of Educational Leadership, Curriculum and Instruction during their time as preservice teachers. The course included a two-week study abroad component in Costa Rica. Participants spent their mornings observing a monolingual, Spanish-speaking elementary classroom followed by a faculty-led multicultural seminar. Afternoons during the study abroad experience were dedicated to field science activities such as quantifying plant and animal biodiversity, constructing elevation profiles, determining nutrient storage in soil, and calculating river velocity. Throughout the course students participated in science-focused excursions.    A cross case study design was used to answer the two research questions guiding this dissertation study. Data collection included participant-created concept maps of the science experiences during the study abroad experience, in-depth interviews detailing the study abroad experience and classroom instruction, and participant reflective journal entries. Cross-caseanalysis was employed to explore the uniqueness of each participant’s experience and commonalities between the cases. Trustworthiness was established by utilizing multiple sources of data, member checking, documenting the process of identifying themes from findings, and peer de-briefing.    Four themes emerged via data analysis, they include: (1) experiencing science in Costa Rica, comprised of the categories of facilitated science experiences, collaborative grouping, and science stressors; (2) studying abroad in Costa Rica, containing the categories Costa Rica is your oyster, background of Costa Rica, foreground of Costa Rica, atmosphere of Costa Rica, and Costa Rican culture; (3) transferability of science experiences including the categories disposition of teaching, pedagogical knowledge, what you teach, and for whom you teach; and (4) the multicultural classroom made up of the categories Costa Rican classroom struggles, positive Costa Rican classroom climate, transferability of instructional approaches, and developing cultural competency.    Implications for study abroad decision-makers and stakeholders are included. Additionally, recommendations for future research are also described. Preservice science teachers develop their knowledge of science, confidence to teach science, and ability to instruct students in the field of science in a multicultural classroom, as a product of science-focused study abroad opportunities.

T1  - Evaluation of Student Competence in Simulation following a Prebriefing Activity: A Pilot Study
AN  - 1993417654
AB  - Background: Simulation-based learning (SBL) shows promise to potentially improve clinical competence in nursing education. The efficacy of evidence-based prebriefing activities and valid and reliable systems to evaluate those strategies is a gap in the literature. Preliminary evidence shows that prebriefing can improve participant outcomes. The goal of this pilot study was to compare the outcome of clinical competence for prelicensure nursing students based on assignment to one of the following prebriefing activities: standard, careplan, or concept mapping.    Methods: This is a quasi-experimental double-blind, posttest only, comparison-group design, pilot study. The participants were from an associate degree professional nursing program. Out of a potential 30 students, 28 agreed to participate. The data collection occurred during two laboratory sessions of their medical-surgical course. The students were exposed to an assigned prebriefing activity and then engaged in a simulation scenario. Two faculty simulation evaluators (FSEs) watched the videoed performance and evaluated the students’ clinical competence using the Creighton Competency Evaluation Instrument (C-CEI). Demographic data were used to analyze the homogeneity of the groups and to determine if other factors affected clinical competence. An ANOVA was used to answer the research questions.    Results: Based on the analysis, gender, age, course grade, race and ethnicity, the groups were similar. Interrater reliability of the C-CEI overall (Kappa = 0.096 with p = 0.02) and communication (Kappa = 0.349 with p = 0.01) scores between the FSEs were significantly different. Based on their Cronbach’s alpha score (0.74) FSE Two’s ratings were used for analysis. There were no significant changes in C-CEI scores based on the students’ assigned prebriefing activity. There were significant differences between participant scores (communication 4.3(26), p = < 0.001; Clinical Judgement 2.7(26), p = 0.011; Overall 2.8(26), p = 0.01) based on their scenario.    Conclusions: Issues with the FSFs and FSEs revealed ways to improved future simulation-based research. Ensuring scenario complexity is equivalent assures comparable participant performance. Measures to enhance FSE interrater reliability must be implemented.    Limitations: The sample size was inadequate to determine statistically significant data. A lack of randomization of assignment to groups is also a limitation. An FSF provided additional cueing which could have affected some student’s C-CEI scores.

T1  - A Comparative Study of Hawaii Middle School Science Student Academic Achievement
AN  - 1985701892
AB  - The problem was middle-grade students with specific learning disabilities (SWDs) in reading comprehension perform less well than their peers on standardized assessments. The purpose of this quantitative comparative study was to examine the effect of electronic concept maps on reading comprehension of eighth grade students with SWD reading comprehension in a Hawaii middle school Grade 8 science class on the island of Oahu. The target population consisted of Grade 8 science students for school year 2015–2016. The sampling method was a purposeful sampling with a final sample size of 338 grade 8 science students. De-identified archival records of grade 8 Hawaii standardized science test scores were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS. The finding for hypothesis 1 indicated a significant difference in student achievement between SWDs and SWODs as measured by Hawaii State Assessment (HSA) in science scores (p < 0.05), and for hypothesis 2, a significant difference in instructional modality for SWDs who used concept maps and does who did not as measured by the Hawaii State Assessment in science (p < 0.05). The implications of the findings (a) SWDs performed less well in science achievement than their peers and consequently, and (b) SWODs appeared to remember greater degrees of science knowledge, and answered more questions correctly than SWDs as a result of reading comprehension. Recommendations for practice were for educational leadership and noted: (a) teachers should practice using concept maps with SWDs as a specific reading strategy to support reading comprehension in science classes, (b) involve a strong focus on vocabulary building and concept building during concept map construction because the construction of concept maps sometimes requires frontloading of vocabulary, and (c) model for teachers how concept maps are created and to explain their educational purpose as a tool for learning. Recommendations for future research were to conduct (a) a quantitative comparative study between groups for academic achievement of subtests mean scores of SWDs and SWODs in physical science, earth science, and space science, and (b) a quantitative correlation study to examine relationships and predictive values for academic achievement of SWDs and concept map integration on standardized science assessments.

T1  - Using Concept Maps to Monitor Knowledge Structure Changes in a Science Classroom
AN  - 1961296033
AB  - The aim of this research is to determine what differences may exist in students’ structural knowledge while using a variety of concept mapping assessments. A concept map can be used as an assessment which connects concepts in a knowledge domain. A single assessment may not be powerful enough to establish how students’ new knowledge relates to prior knowledge. More research is needed to establish how various aspects of the concept mapping task influence the output of map creation by students. Using multiple concept maps and pre-instruction and post-instruction VNOS instruments during a 16-week semester, this study was designed to investigate the impact of concept map training and the impact of assessment design on the created maps. Also, this study was designed to determine what differences can be observed between expert and novice maps and if similarities and differences exist between concept maps and an open-ended assessment. Participants created individual maps and the maps were analyzed for structural complexity, overall structure, and content. The concept maps were then compared by their timing, design, and scores.   The results indicate that concept mapping training does significantly impact the shape and structure complexity of the map created by students. Additionally, these data support that students should be frequently reminded of appropriate concept mapping skills and opportunities so that good mapping skills will be utilized. Changing the assessment design does appear to be able to impact the overall structure and complexity of created maps, while narrowing the content focus of the map does not necessarily restrict the overall structure or the complexity.   Furthermore, significant differences in structural complexity were observed between novice and expert mappers. The fluctuations of NOS concepts identified in student created maps may suggest why some students were still confused or had incorrect conceptions of NOS, despite explicit and reflective instruction throughout the semester.

T1  - Using Concept Maps with Simulation: Learning Experiences of Associate Degree in Nursing Students
AN  - 1943998627
AB  - Graduate nurses have experienced a difficult transition to clinical practice. With the continuing gap in educational preparation and clinical nursing practice leading to errors in health care delivery, the nurse faculty remains challenged in performing innovative changes to the curriculum to improve and maintain quality and safe patient care. The use of simulation and other simulation-based experiences have emerged in nursing education. Research using the simulation with concept mapping has shown promising results in the baccalaureate nursing programs. However, the combined use of concept mapping and simulation is limited in the associate level of nursing programs. The purpose of this exploratory qualitative single case study was to explore the learning experiences of seven nursing students enrolled in the first nursing course from a two-year nursing program at a private college in the New England state. In using the purposeful sampling method, data collection and content analysis originated from the study participants’ responses to a field-tested interview protocol. Research questions focused on the learning perspectives of the value in using a concept map with simulation in developing the critical thinking and reasoning skills and the appropriateness as a teaching pedagogy to help translate the knowledge into the clinical practice. Study findings indicated the feeling of uncertainty, confusion, and an overwhelming experience. However, the students found both activities helpful in developing the essential competencies if utilized in the beginning of the first nursing course and consistently across the program. Study findings contribute to an increase awareness of the nurse faculty on the benefits of utilizing a concept map with simulation as teaching pedagogies to learn about the nursing practice. Recommendations for future studies include comparing the learning perspectives with male nursing students and extending the research by following the student progress in the nursing program.

T1  - Factors That Influence Physicians to Assume Leadership Roles: A Focus on Clinical Integration
AN  - 1927182094
AB  - The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) drastically altered the healthcare industry in the United States. Along with multiple other directives, the PPACA mandated that physicians and hospitals work together in strategies known as clinical integration. For effective clinical integration to be achieved, interdependence among physicians and hospitals is required to provide the highest quality outcomes for patients at the best possible value. To this end, healthcare leaders have identified that the key to establishing successful clinical integration is the presence and commitment of physician leaders (Penlington & Marshall, 2016).    This study explores factors that influenced a sample of physician leaders to assume leadership roles in clinical integration. The qualitative phenomenology methodology was selected to study the experiences of physician leaders through their own perspectives. The theoretical framework is guided by the concept of meta-leadership, with a focus on the dimensions of leadership in context and trust.    Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 purposefully selected physicians holding leadership roles within hospitals, hospital-employed medical groups, and/or physician-hospital associations. Data collected from these in-depth interviews related to four research questions: (1) How do physicians make the decision to transition into leadership roles within health systems?; (2) What leadership skills are required for physician leaders within health systems?; (3) To what extent does healthcare reform impact physician leadership within health systems?; and (4) What are the perceived benefits and drawbacks of being a physician leader within health systems?    Based on the four research questions, a concept map was developed to code themes and patterns in participant responses. The overall key findings of this study include: (a) encouragement by mentors or friends, (b) career progression into leadership, (c) desire to impact change, (d) lack of prior leadership education or training, (e) the importance of change management, (f) acceptance and management of healthcare reform, (g) need for physician leaders in healthcare, (h) enjoyment in leadership responsibilities, (i) the importance of having influence and a voice in decision making, (j) giving up time devoted to other causes, (k) frustrations with the amount of time needed to impact change, (l) difficulties in work/life balance, and (m) difficulties in leadership/clinical balance.    Recommendations from this empirical investigation provide guidance to health systems seeking physician leaders. Understanding the leadership choices of current physician leaders is instrumental to inspiring, recruiting, and training additional physician leaders to meet clinical integration needs. If healthcare leaders can begin to understand the reason current physicians have accepted leadership roles, they may be better equipped to recruit additional physician leaders.

T1  - The Engineering Design Process: Conceptions Along the Learning-to-Teach Continuum
AN  - 1892091106
AB  - In this study, I sought to identify differences in the views and understandings of engineering design among individuals along the learning-to-teach continuum. To do so, I conducted a comprehensive review of literature to determine the various aspects of engineering design described in the fields of professional engineering and engineering education. Additionally, I reviewed literature on the methods used in teaching engineering design at the secondary (grade 7-12) level – to describe the various models used in classrooms, even before the implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards  (NGSS Lead States, 2013). Last, I defined four groups along the learning-to-teach continuum: prospective, preservice, and practicing teachers, as well as teacher educators.   The context of this study centered around a California public university, including an internship program where undergraduates engaged with practicing mentor teachers in science and engineering teaching at local high schools, and a teacher education program where secondary science preservice teachers and the teacher educators who taught them participated. Interviews were conducted with all participants to gain insights into their views and understandings of engineering design. Prospective and preservice teachers were interviewed multiple times throughout the year and completed concept maps of the engineering design process multiple times as well; practicing teachers and teacher educators were interviewed once.   Three levels of analyses were conducted. I identified 30 aspects of engineering discussed by participants. Through phenomenographic methods, I also constructed six conceptual categories for engineering design to organize those aspects most commonly discussed. These categories were combined to demonstrate a participant’s view of engineering design (e.g., business focused, human centered, creative, etc.) as well as their complexity of understanding of engineering design overall (the more categories their ideas fit within, the more complex their understanding was thought to be).   I found that the most commonly referenced aspects of engineering design were in line with the three main dimensions described in the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS Lead States, 2013). I also found that the practicing teacher participants overall conveyed the most complex and integrated understandings of engineering design, with the undergraduate, prospective teachers not far behind. One of the most important factors related to a more integrated understanding of engineering design was having formal engineering experience, especially in the form of conducting engineering research or having been a professional engineer.   Further, I found that female participants were more likely than their male counterparts to view engineering as having a human element—recognizing the need to collaborate with others throughout the process and the need to think about the potential user of the product the engineer is solving the problem for. These findings suggest that prior experience with engineering, and not experience in the classroom or with engineering education, tends to lead to a deeper, more authentic view of engineering. Finally, I close with a discussion of the overall findings, limitations of the study, potential implications, and future work.

T1  - Effectiveness of Concept Mapping: A Constructivist Based Educational Strategy on Grade Seven Arab Students' Academic Achievement in Chemistry
AN  - 2878257787
AB  - The present study aimed to determine the effects of concept mapping, a constructivist based learning strategy, on academic achievement in chemistry. The participants were 64 grade seven students in a K-12 British curriculum private school in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. The study employed a quasiexperimental, pre-test, post-test design using an achievement test called CMAT (Chemistry Matter Achievement Test). The experimental group were taught a topic in chemistry with concept mapping strategy for a period of four weeks and the control group were taught the same topic using expository method for the same period of time. The data collected were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics. The mean post test score of the experimental group was found to significantly be higher than the mean post test score of the control group. Results showed that concept mapping is an effective strategy for teaching and learning chemistry concepts. The data analysis also revealed that the concept mapping strategy is capable of enhancing learners’ mastery of content at higher order levels of cognition. The findings of this study recommended that chemistry educators should use concept mapping strategy as a pedagogical and evaluation tool as it can enhance students’ meaningful understanding of chemistry concepts, longer retention of information and academic performance in the subject content.

T1  - Understanding preschool teachers' beliefs about young children's outdoor play
AN  - 2022266312
AB  - The purpose of this study was to gain understanding of preschool teachers' beliefs about young children's outdoor play and to describe individual teachers' personal experiences with regard to outdoor play on a more naturalized playground that has been newly developed in their work site. A constructivist approach was used since this study mainly focused on individual teachers' beliefs. For primary data collection, three in-depth individual interviews were administered and concept maps were collected as secondary data to portray individual participants' beliefs and knowledge to supplement the findings of this study. For data analysis, Charmaz's (2006) constructivist grounded theory was employed using two steps of coding, initial and focused. Major emerging themes generated from this study included: 1) Teachers value outdoor play for educational, developmental, and well-being purposes, 2) Teachers perceive that natural outdoor environments promote learning and development in their own unique ways, and 3) Teachers attempt to provide quality outdoor play by performing various roles during outdoor play. First, the preschool teachers' beliefs about the value of outdoor play included promoting freedom. The teachers also perceived that outdoor play is beneficial for facilitating young children's development in different domains, such as physical, social, emotional, and creative. Second, the preschool teachers' beliefs about young children's outdoor play in natural environments included benefits such as promoting hands-on learning, sensory development, and use of imagination and creativity. In addition, the teachers in this study perceived that interactive experiences in the natural environment enable young children to develop their sense of appreciation of nature. Third, the preschool teachers in this study served various roles for providing outdoor play. The teachers perceived being a safety supervisor as their most important role during outdoor play. Additionally, barriers for providing outdoor play were specified, and they appeared to be related to the teachers' preparations and planning for providing outdoor play. The constructivist grounded theory of understanding preschool teachers' beliefs about outdoor play were expressed as a series of proposition statements based on core themes and categories grounded in the data. The implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed at the end of the study. (Full text of this dissertation may be available via the University of Florida Libraries web site.

T1  - Scaffolding understanding at a conceptual level in an l2 academic context: a sct approach
AN  - 1913432768
AB  - Within the socio-cultural school of thought, Galperin, was influenced by Vygotsky’s theory of mind. Following Vygotsky’s argument about the leading role of instruction within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), Galperin developed an instructional approach, known as Systemic Theoretical Instruction (STI), which encourages the active construction of materialized concepts and their monitored transformation into mental processes in order to foster development. Following from this, the present thesis aimed at investigating a) how knowledge at a conceptual level can be fostered and supported online, b) the affordances of an online (Moodle-based) Pedagogic Unit to potentially foster L2 English online academic training with specific reference to Applied Linguistics terminology (although the findings could be applicable to other disciplines as well) c) the effectiveness of the online scaffolding mechanisms that were developed for each online task and d) the students’ views with regards to all the previous. To this end, this study adopted an exploratory qualitative approach and collected various types of data to support conceptual development among 13 UK based L2 learners who were pursuing postgraduate studies. Importantly, while existing STI investigations have employed mainly qualitative data, the analysis conducted for this study included both quantitative and qualitative methods such as introspection techniques, recorded interviews, pre-post interview tasks, concept-mapping, online Moodle tasks and questionnaires, screen-captures and audio recordings of the online activities. The findings revealed that the Moodle unit was a suitable environment in fostering the students’ conceptual development and that specific scaffolding features and types of tasks have contributed towards this. Furthermore, this study contributes to the growing body of research into the potential role of scaffolding to enhance ZPDs in online environments in order to facilitate the L2 learners’ English for Academic Purposes training. It also sheds light into the affordances of STI and online environments to develop the students’ academic speaking and reading skills which, ultimately, contribute to overall conceptual development. Finally, it highlights the potential role of verbalisation (through introspection tasks, use of concept maps and oral presentations) as a means of both fostering and assessing conceptual development.

T1  - Mind-Bodies, Interdependent Opposites and Knots: A Phenomenological Inquiry into the Child-Teacher Relationship in Upper Primary School
AN  - 1896027361
AB  - This study is a qualitative, phenomenological inquiry into teachers’ and children’s ‘lived experiences’ of the child-teacher relationship in an Irish upper primary school context. It highlights the current need to re-focus our attention on the child-teacher relationship which Biesta (2004) argues is the 'location' of education. An overview of the literature on relational pedagogy is provided which connects the child-teacher relationship to broader theoretical debates including Heidegger's (1962) concept of Mitsein and Buber's I- Thou relation (1937). Hermeneutic phenomenology describes the overarching methodology following van Manen’s (1990) ‘lived experience’ approach.The study was conducted in a large, suburban, primary school with designated disadvantaged status. Before data generation commenced, a Children’s Research Advisory Group was established in the school following Lundy, McEvoy, and Byrne (2011). The function of this group was to advise about conducting research with children. Research participants included three teachers and five children from each of those teachers’ classes. Data generation featured the use of protocol writing and conversational interviews following van Manen (1990, 2014) and the use of embodied, drama methods which were unique to this study but inspired by the work of Norris (2000) and guided by O’Sullivan (2011). Data was also generated using visual methods drawing on the work of Mitchell (2011), Tinkler (2015) and Chappell and Craft (2011). In line with the phenomenological approach adopted, data was interpreted in what Gadamer (1989) describes as a circular manner. This involves attending to ‘parts’ whilst keeping in mind the ‘whole’ picture.This study identified three overarching thematic findings which find resonance with the fields of relational pedagogy and embodied teaching and learning as well as new insights at the point where these two areas overlap. These include how teachers and children relate to one another as ‘whole, embodied feeling beings’; the idea that there is a tension between ‘closeness’ and ‘distance’ in the child teacher relationship and that there is a need for both ‘structure’ and ‘freedom’ to feature in that relationship. Further, this study found that the child-teacher relationship is experienced as ‘knotted’ with social and contextual relationships. These findings are discussed in light of the concepts of ‘connectedness’ and ‘emergence’, features of complexity theory. This study provides new insights into how teachers and children experience their relationships with one another, thereby extending the body of knowledge on the child-teacher relationship.

T1  - A framework for collaborative knowledge management: Using distributed mentoring
AN  - 1895150984
AB  - Knowledge management consists of four key processes, generation, distribution, storage, and application. Today, with the simultaneous growth of World Wide Web and usage of computing devices, including smart phones, tablets, and laptops, knowledge is also being generated and modified by knowledge-contributors, labeled mentors. Output of this process makes its way into various sources, such as wikis, blogs, and Question- and-answer websites. New storage technologies are continuously being evolved in order to efficiently handle huge volumes of this kind of unstructured data. However, distribution of knowledge to knowledge-consumers, labeled mentees, has not been evolved to keep up with the exponential growth in generation and storage. Since all four phases of knowledge management are relatively interdependent, sub-optimal growth in only some of the phases causes an imbalance to the knowledge management effort as a whole. This results in problems like disconnected learning, inadequate knowledge summary, repetition of efforts, and limited recommendations. To address this limitation in knowledge management, we introduced a framework for collaborative knowledge management using distributed mentoring where individual knowledge of all participants is collected into a shared knowledge repository and systematically transformed into visual community knowledge by collaborative efforts of both mentors and mentees. We apply the framework in educational, organizational, and online settings. Architectural design to implement the framework along with the results derived from case study of an online community are presented.

T1  - Becoming STEM Teachers: Examining Changes in Science Teachers' Conceptual Understanding About Earthquake Engineering
AN  - 1888016635
AB  - This multi-paper dissertation reports results from three related research studies centered on the development and use of an authentic measure, concept mapping, to assess changes in workshop teachers’ conceptual understanding of earthquake engineering. My review of the literature indicated few research studies examining how traditionally trained science teachers develop STEM-related understandings about the complex relationships between concepts associated with STEM-related contexts, such as those existing within the context of earthquake engineering. STEM researchers currently know little about how teachers develop deep conceptual understanding of complex and interdisciplinary content knowledge. To address the gap I found in the literature, I designed three studies to: (1) conduct a modified Delphi study to create a list of key concepts as a knowledge base in earthquake engineering, (2) examine changes in science teachers’ conceptual understanding of earthquake engineering as a result of their participation to an engineering-oriented teacher professional development (EOTPD), and (3) investigate changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation discourse after their participation in a week-long EOTPD.   Researchers suggest identification of key concepts in critical engineering content areas for high school science teachers to increase their engineering content knowledge. In my first study, I identified and verified key concepts in earthquake engineering necessary for high school learners to acquire a basic understanding of earthquake engineering.   Results included a key concepts list and an interdisciplinary strand map with 35 earthquake engineering key concepts in five domains.   Furthermore, stakeholders suggest providing opportunities for STEM teachers to improve their conceptual understanding in critical engineering areas within EOTPDs. In my second study, I developed a conceptual framework, Meaningful Conceptual Learning, for successful conceptual understanding of complex and interdisciplinary content knowledge, implemented the framework into an EOTPD on earthquake engineering, used individual and group concept mapping as authentic assessment method. Results indicated science teachers enhanced their conceptual understanding of the earthquake engineering content knowledge after the EOTPD.   Stakeholders in science education also emphasize the critical role of using argumentation discourse in teaching science and indicate most science teachers still lack the pedagogical skills to introduce and enhance students’ argumentation discourse skills. In my third study, I implemented argumentation discourse with a procedural guideline involving EOTPD participants’ reasons for the inclusion of various concepts in their concept maps. I used a modified method for collecting and analyzing discourse data and found significant enhancement in teachers’ argumentation discourse levels after the implementation.

T1  - The Influence of Team Psychological Safety on Team Knowledge Creation: A Comparative Study between Thai, French and American Engineering Teams
AN  - 1880560482
AB  - This research evaluates the impact of team psychological safety on the creation of team knowledge. When teams engage in team learning and display the associated learning behaviors (seeking feedback, asking for help, innovative behavior, boundary spanning and speaking up about concerns or mistakes), their interactions contribute to improved task performance. Very little research evaluates if these behaviors, rooted in the level of psychological safety within the team, also result in the creation of knowledge at the team level, either related to the task or related to the team itself. The proposed model is developed and evaluated through a mixed method research design around a team problem solving experiment. Concept mapping and questionnaires are used as elicitation methods for the taskand team-related team mental models respectively and enhanced with the results of one-onone and team interviews. Evaluations at different intervals evaluate the changes over time of the knowledge created in the team. The model is evaluated in teams from three different cultural backgrounds (USA, France and Thailand), to assess if culture influences team psychological safety, and to verify its moderating effect on team knowledge creation.    The research findings confirm the validity of the proposed research model for teams from the USA and France, in particular the hypotheses that both team psychological safety and team learning impact the creation of team-related and task-related team knowledge. The model is not confirmed for teams from Thailand and the research finds that team psychological safety is influenced by cultural components. A number of possible explanations for the case of teams from Thailand are proposed.    This research has theoretical and practical benefits. The research is unique in that team learning behaviors are evaluated through the codification of team interactions, rather than from team members’ own assessments. It also measures the impact of team learning not just on the task, but evaluates team knowledge in a dynamic way by analyzing the team- and task-related mental models over a period of time. From a practical point of view, the research demonstrates that developing team psychological safety and creating team learning opportunities brings benefits in the development of the team’s knowledge even if they may not impact the current task. The research also highlights that this may not be generalizable across all cultures.    This research was done with engineering teams from \a single organization. Future research could validate the model in other teams in multiple organizations. For the teams from Thailand in this research, both the proposed research model and the original model on which it was based are not validated. This finding should be confirmed or further evaluated with other teams in Thailand or other cultures in Asia.

T1  - Conceptual understanding of threshold concepts of electrical phenomena: Mental models of senior undergraduates in electrical engineering
AN  - 1875556309
AB  - Every field of study has a set of domain-specific concepts that anyone who desires to work in that field must know and understand. Most students who pursue university degrees in engineering trust that their education is designed to provide them with this knowledge. But does it? In electrical engineering (EE), conceptual understanding of electrical phenomena has rarely been addressed. Even though the presumed goal of instructors and students alike is to learn the concepts of electrical phenomena well enough to be able to use the concepts to design useful things, it is difficult to determine whether this goal is being achieved. The purpose of this study was to develop reasonable representations of the mental models used by senior EE students as they thought about and worked with electrical phenomena. Focusing on students’ mental models of threshold concepts in electrical phenomena can thus increase knowledge of students’ conceptual understanding, which can contribute to systematic research into pedagogical and assessment methods in this area of study, which forms one of the most basic and fundamental areas of knowledge needed by EE students.   Thus, the research question addressed by this study was:   What do senior EE students’ mental models of the fundamental electrical phenomena of voltage, current, and the relationship between them look like?    The theory of mental models claims that everyone organizes their understanding of the way the world works by constructing models in the mind by which they both explain phenomena that they observe, and make predictions about what is likely to occur in a given situation.   To observe the students’ mental models in operation, semi-structured interviews were used to engage the participants in a conversation concerning their knowledge and experience in applying electrical ideas. Using discourse analysis, a representation of each student’s mental model was created, consisting of a concept map and a short narrative. While the models were all different, analysis of them as a group led to the emergence of five dominant themes, or ways of thinking.   The findings of this study have implications for the course of study that these students are engaged in. How effective has it been in developing the conceptual understanding that they will need after they graduate? Knowledge of the outcomes of a course of study: the conceptual understanding of these students, the misconceptions present in their models, and the dominant themes that drive their models, can inform ongoing efforts in curriculum development.

T1  - The Impact of Short Papers on Clinical Decision Making Skills of Nursing Students
AN  - 1875195297
AB  - Clinical decision making and critical thinking are fundamental skills to ensuring the success of undergraduate nursing students. Nursing faculty, and specifically clinical nursing faculty, are responsible for encouraging the development of these types of skills as students work in direct patient care. Traditional methods of clinical evaluation include lengthy case studies, concept mapping, and discussion board participation. While these methods have been in effect for some time, clinical short paper assignments are a fresh, innovative way to challenge students as they refine their critical thinking and clinical decision making abilities. No statistically significant difference was found between the perceived level of clinical decision making before and after the implementation of short written assignments; however, the overall mean score of clinical decision making abilities did increase following the implementation of clinical short papers.

T1  - Merging metacognitive tools for use in higher education to facilitate meaningful learning
AN  - 1874880296
AB  - The current trend towards student-centred teaching and learning is bringing about a change in emphasis in Higher Education: a shift from promoting effective teaching towards developing an understanding of how students learn. Prevalent literature calls for more emphasis on the students‟ learning process through increased metacognition and critical reflection. This research revolves around the premise that learning takes place through the interaction of cognition (thinking), affectation (feeling) and conation (doing). Consequently, this study presents a model of teaching and learning in Higher Education through the integrated use of metacognitive tools, namely, Vee Heuristics and Concept Mapping along with an awareness of how students prefer to learn. This research suggests that when metacognitive tools are merged, students are empowered to embark upon a meta-learning journey which eventually leads to critical reflection and meaningful learning. In the Action Research carried out in the first phase, University students‟ work products, from the University of Malta, are used to trace the effect of a learner‟s mental operations on the learner‟s use of Vee Heuristics and Concept Mapping as the learner embeds and retrieves new and scaffolded knowledge. The analysis of data reveals the powerful effect which this combination of learning tools yielded on student achievement. The model presented yielded successful meaningful learning; however, one cannot assume that the same results will be produced if this model is used by other teachers. This reflection led to an emergent multilevel mixed method design in the second phase where the role of the teacher was highlighted to illustrate that teachers must see the purpose and value of the tools they are using. The teaching and learning process becomes most effective when teachers plan intentional approaches in response to how students are learning. Action research promotes a cyclical process and I am coming to a personal understanding that the tools and strategies did help me to create a meaningful learning environment which adequately responds to the „learning-how-to-learn‟ concept. However, at the heart of quality teaching was my continuous reflective approach about the learning process and my own practice. I started this research by fallaciously assuming that focusing solely on the learner would bring about meaningful learning. However, the research has demonstrated that both students and lecturers are equally important and they should be seen as partners in achieving the intended learning outcome.

T1  - An investigation of preservice teachers' understanding of buoyancy
AN  - 1871146928
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the conceptual understandings of 55 elementary preservice teachers for the concept of buoyancy. This study used Ausubel’s Assimilation Theory (Ausubel, 1963) as a framework for a 15-week intervention that used pre/post concept maps (Cmaps), pre/post face-to-face semi-structured interviews, and drawings as evidences for change of formation of cognitive structures. Using a convergent parallel design and mixed methods approach, preservice teachers’ conceptions were analyzed using these evidences. Results of the study show that preservice teachers held both scientific conceptions and misconceptions about buoyancy as a force before and after an instructional intervention. Of importance were the existence of robust misconceptions about buoyancy that included inaccurate scientific knowledge about the foundational concepts of gravity, weight, mass, and density. The largest gains in scientific knowledge included the concepts of gravity, surface area, opposing forces, and the buoyant force. These concepts were consistently supported with evidence from post-concept maps, post, semi-structured interviews, and drawings. However, high frequencies of misconceptions were associated with these same aforementioned concepts as well as additional misconceptions about buoyancy-related concepts (i.e., weight, density, displacement, and sinking/floating). A paired t test showed a statistically significant difference (t = -3.504, p = .001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD = .879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The Cohen’s d effect size was small, .47. Even through gains for the pre/post concept maps were noted, a qualitative analysis of the results indicated that not only were there serious gaps in the participant’s scientific understanding of buoyancy, after the instructional intervention an increased number of misconceptions were presented alongside the newly learned concepts. A paired t test examining misconceptions showed that there was a statistically significant difference (t = -3.160, p = .003) in the total number of misconceptions for the pre-concept maps (M = 2.709, SD = 1.449) and post-concept maps (M = 3.363, SD = 2.094) after the intervention. The Cohen’s d effect size was small, .43.  Taken together, these results revealed that, in general, the preservice teachers had understandings of buoyancy that align with children in preschool and elementary school (Biddulph and Osborne, 1983; Grimellini-Tomasini et al., 1990; Halford, Brown & Thompson, 1986; Hsin and Wu, 2011; Kohn, 1993; Rappolt-Schlichtmann et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2008). Based on these findings, implications for this study suggest that elementary preservice teacher candidates should be carefully screened to ensure they have mastered foundational scientific knowledge that they are expected to teach to children. As such knowledge is a prerequisite to the development of pedagogical content knowledge, it is unlikely that large numbers of robust misconceptions will be significantly reduced or eliminated during a science methods course that is designed to focus on pedagogical content knowledge.

T1  - Conceptualizing In-service Secondary School Science Teachers' Knowledge Base for Promoting Understanding about the Science of Global Climate Change
AN  - 1870786053
AB  - Efforts to adapt and mitigate the effects of global climate change (GCC) have been ongoing for the past two decades and have become a major global concern. However, research and practice for promoting climate literacy and understanding about GCC have only recently become a national priority. The National Research Council (NRC), has recently emphasized upon the importance of developing learners’ capacity of reasoning, their argumentation skills and understanding of GCC (Framework for K-12 Science Education, National Research Council, 2012). This framework focuses on fostering conceptual clarity about GCC to promote innovation, resilience, and readiness in students as a response towards the threat of a changing environment. Previous research about teacher understanding of GCC describes that in spite of the prevalent frameworks like the AAAS Science Literacy Atlas (AAAS, 2007) and the  Essential Principles for Climate Literacy (United States Global Climate Research Program, 2009; Bardsley, 2007), most learners are challenged in understanding the science of GCC (Michail et al., 2007) and misinformed perceptions about basic climate science content and the role of human activities in changing climate remain persistent (Reibich and Gautier, 2006). Our teacher participants had a rather simplistic knowledge structure. While aware of climate change, teacher participants lacked in depth understanding of how change in climate can impact various ecosystems on the Earth. Furthermore, they felt overwhelmed with the extensive amount of information needed to comprehend the complexity in GCC. Hence, extensive efforts not only focused on assessing conceptual understanding of GCC but also for teaching complex science topics like GCC are essential. This dissertation explains concept mapping, and the photo elicitation method for assessing teachers’ understanding of GCC and the use of metacognitive scaffolding in instruction of GCC for developing competence of learners in this complex science phenomenon.

T1  - Girls' perceptions of mathematics: an interpretive study of girls' mathematical identities
AN  - 1865298102
AB  - This thesis explores girls’ perceptions of mathematics and how they make sense of their mathematical identity. It seeks to understand the characterisations girls make of mathematics and mathematicians, shedding light upon their positioning as mathematicians. This is important because there remains a tendency for able females to rate themselves lower than males of a similar attainment, and be less likely to continue into post-compulsory study of mathematics. This research followed an interpretive paradigm, taking a grounded, case-based approach and using a mosaic of qualitative methods. Fourteen girls from a school in the south-east of England aged 8-9 at the start of the study took part in the research over 15 months. The data collected comprised scrapbooks, concept maps, relationship wheels, drawings, digital photographs, metaphors, group and individual interviews. Data were analysed using open and focused coding, sensitising concepts and constant comparison to arrive at key categories and themes. The main conclusions of the study are that time taken to explore the diversity of girls’ perceptions of themselves as mathematicians provides a powerful insight into their identity formation. Many girls struggled to articulate the purpose of mathematics dominant in their vision of what it meant to be a mathematician. Whilst they recognised a rich variety of authentic mathematical activity at home, this was overwhelmed by number, calculation, speed and processes, with mathematics recognised as desk-bound and isolating. They made sense of their mathematical identity through their characterisations of mathematics alongside interactions and comparisons with others. The girls in the study took a high degree of responsibility for their own development, believing they could improve with ever-greater effort. However, this led to the need for a buffer zone, allowing teachers, family and friends to support the individual in continuing to grow and protecting them from mathematical harm. This research recommends the provision of safe spaces for mathematical exploration in terms of time, space and collaboration, connecting mathematical study with application and interest, reframing mathematics as a social endeavour and sharing responsibility with girls for their mathematical development. Finally, it suggests the value of practitioners paying close attention to girls’ evolving mathematical identities.

T1  - Making school discipline kinder: Developing a roadmap for youth well-being
AN  - 1858815913
AB  - BACKGROUND: School discipline—how schools manage and respond to student misbehavior—is a central component of how schools seek to create safe and productive learning environments. School suspensions have been a popular discipline strategy in recent decades. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated the association between punitive discipline strategies and poor outcomes in youth, including increased high school dropout rates, decreased odds of enrolling in postsecondary school, and increased mental health concerns. There is an urgent need to examine alternate mechanisms for addressing school discipline other than punitive exclusionary or reward-based systems. This dissertation seeks to develop an integrated model of promising approaches and define how such a system could work. OBJECTIVES: This dissertation is made up of three studies addressing three aims: (1) to synthesize the existing literature on how school discipline has been constructed and its impact on student well being; (2) to develop a novel conceptual model for an alternate discipline approach, “kind discipline,” and; (3) to develop and validate a measure for assessing the practice of kind discipline in elementary and middle schools. METHODS: Study one is a theoretical review utilizing a social ecological model to frame how school discipline models address an individual, relational, or structural level. Study two is a formative evaluation that develops a novel conceptual model for an alternative discipline approach. This study utilized concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on school discipline from teachers, administrators, school staff, and other stakeholders involved in school programming. The concept mapping included a brainstorming phase, a statement analysis phase, a sorting and rating phase, and multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of the collected data. It culminated in a map that visually represent the group’s ideas and how they are interrelated. Study three validated a newly developed measure of kind discipline through an assessment of the measure’s internal consistency, an exploration of convergent and discriminant validity, and a descriptive analysis of the strength of relationships between kind discipline and school-level discipline frequency. RESULTS:  The theoretical review illustrated how different school discipline approaches address disparate explanations of what may lead to student misbehavior. The formative evaluation developed a conceptual model for kind discipline in which three core themes emerged from 11 identified clusters in the conceptual model: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. When mapped onto a social ecological model, the identified components of kind discipline encompassed all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. In the study validating a measure of kind discipline, teacher and student assessments of kind discipline were strongly correlated (Pearson’s Correlation -.772, p=0.005). Convergent validity of the measure was supported by our finding that the more positively students assessed kind discipline in their schools, the lower the school disciplinary action rate (β=-0.759, p=0.05). Mixed linear models showed teachers’ perceived kind discipline at the school level predicted individual students’ perception of kind discipline. Girls reported higher levels of kind discipline than boys; and students in higher grades reported lower levels of kind discipline than students in lower grades. CONCLUSIONS: Effective school discipline programs may need to operate on multiple levels. There is increasing support for the importance of a relationship-level component to disciplinary approaches. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings from the concept mapping illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed. The student and teacher measures for assessing the level of kind discipline in a school show promise as tools for evaluating schools working to improve approaches to discipline and for guiding interventions that aim to promote positive and relational motivation strategies.

T1  - Technology Acceptance and Course Completion Rates in Online Education: A Non-experimental, Mixed Method Study
AN  - 1858810794
AB  - As the need for quality online courses increase in demand, the acceptance of technology and completion rates become the focus of higher education.  The purpose of this non-experimental, mixed method study was to examine the relationship between the university students’ perceptions and acceptance of technology and learner completion rates with respect to the development of online courses.  This study involved 61 participants from two universities regarding their perceived usefulness (PU) of technology, intent to use technology, and intent to complete a course.  Two research questions were examined regarding student perceptions regarding technology employed in an online course and the relationship, if any, between technology acceptance and completion of an online university course.  The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used to collect data on the usefulness of course activities and student intent to complete the course.  An open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect information concerning student perceptions of course activities.  Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS and Qualtrics, which indicated there was not a significant relationship between technology acceptance and course completion (p = .154).  Qualitative data were examined by pattern matching to create a concept map of the theoretical patterns between constructs.  Pattern matching revealed many students favored the use of the Internet over Canvas.  Furthermore, data showed students enrolled in online courses because of the flexibility and found the multimedia used in the courses as helpful in course completion.  Insight was investigated to offer reasons and decisions concerning choice that were made by the students.  Future recommendations are to expand mixed methods studies of technology acceptance in various disciplines to gain a better understanding of student perceptions of technology uses, intent to use, and course completion.

T1  - Differences in preferred teaching strategies: A quantitative study of nursing student perspectives
AN  - 1854165257
AB  - The preparation of nursing students to meet the demands of the nursing profession remains the goal of academic institutions worldwide.  The most productive methods of preparation, including specific teaching strategies to attain that goal, have long been debated.  This quantitative, non-experimental study included an investigation of the most preferred teaching strategies among baccalaureate degree nursing (BSN) students in an effort to support the development of best practice recommendations for meeting the andragogical needs of adult learners and aid in the preparation of effective nurses who practice safely.  The results of the study showed that BSN students most prefer hands-on, simulation-based teaching strategies and least prefer concept-mapping as a primary teaching strategy.  The results of the study also indicated that the only differences in preferred teaching strategies among BSN students were in relation to academic year, most specifically differences between junior and freshman academic years.  With regard to correlations between learning styles and preferred teaching strategies, the results of the study found significant correlations between BSN students’ self-identified learning styles and their preferred teaching strategies.  The results of the study indicated that nursing educators should implement hands-on, learner-centered teaching strategies in an attempt to meet the learning needs of BSN students.  Finally, the implications of the study support the use of students’ dominant learning styles to drive the choice of teaching strategies in the academic setting.

T1  - Comparing Game Simulation to Concept Models for Student-Centered Learning in Biology
AN  - 1848682585
AB  - Science education research continues to demonstrate improved learning with active-learning techniques compared to lectures. However, the question of which active-learning methods are the most effective for learning complex scientific principles in various context still remains. Models are commonly used in activities that allow students to simplify complex systems and understand how components interact. I investigated the outcomes for student learning and engagement of two model-based activities—concept models and game simulations. The activities were conducted in an introductory biology course in sixteen discussion sections. Eight sections were assigned to the concept model activity and eight to the simulation activity. To assess engagement, students filled out a Likert-scale questionnaire on enjoyment and usefulness of activity (concept model: 130 students for food web activity and 131 for carbon cycle activity; game simulation: 131 students for food web activity and 126 game simulation students during the carbon cycle activity). To assess student learning, 152 students completed pre-post homework assignment based on conservation and transformation of matter. Over 80% of students enjoyed both the concept-mapping and simulation activities. Students reported that the hands-on nature of the concept activity was helpful for understanding the connections in food webs. For the homework assessment, all students significantly increased in their scores from pre to post on the MC (paired t-test, mean pre = 4.86±1.6; meanpost = 5.23±1.6;p<.05) and TF assessments (paired t-test; meanpre = 2.06±1.0 mean post = 2.32±1.0; p<0.05).  For the TF assessments, we observed the trend that students in the simulation group showed a greater improvement in their scores than students in the concept-mapping group (t-test; meanΔ concept = 0.11±1.4; meanΔsimulation =0 .43±1.0 p=.059). There was no difference between student improvement for the two groups on the MC assessment (t-test mean?concept = 0.27±2.1; meanΔ simulation = 0.51±1.8 p=.474). Students’ responses to short answer questions showed those students’ ideas about the concept of matter conservation varied from naive to scientific. For example, students failed to conserve matter during nutrient cycling. More scientific responses demonstrated principled reasoning such as references to conservation of matter.  The students within the two activities did not demonstrate large differences between their text responses for the short answer. Overall, students in both activity type demonstrated learning gains, though there was no significant difference between the activity types.

T1  - Using essays to evaluate learning and comparing human scoring of essays to computer scoring systems
AN  - 1837111751
AB  - Prior research conducted by Butcher, Davies, and Cook (2015, in preparation) demonstrated that using concept maps to search within the online scientific database from the National Science Digital Library (NSDL) decreases cognitive effort over more common keyword-based searches; our purpose was to determine whether this decreased cognitive effort translated into different learning gains as measured by evaluating and scoring pre- and postessays. Teachers are one group who would benefit from more effective, less cognitively demanding ways of finding online material for their classrooms, so the participants in this study were student preservice as well as practicing inservice teachers. Using a rubric developed to evaluate the specific essays written for the Butcher et al. study, we found that participants were able to learn from online search tasks, as measured by more correct information contained in a postessay compared to a pre-essay, and a higher overall score; but this learning was not a function of which online search methods were used. The decreased cognitive effort did not lead to more learning gains as measured in this study.    Our second study compared the hand-scored results from the postessays to two computerized scoring systems: Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) and Coh-Metrix. The purpose of such systems is to help alleviate some of the issues with scoring large numbers of essays by hand. LSA determines semantic similarity between two texts, and Coh-Metrix gives measures of cohesion within each text. LSA correlated moderately with the hand scores (0.44 for the preservice teachers and 0.38 for inservice teachers). Other research has shown higher correlations between LSA and human graders, and because the LSA cosine scores do not show essay quality or level of correctness (only semantic similarity), they could not be substituted for the hand scores. None of the Coh-Metrix cohesion measures correlated significantly with the hand scores. This indicates that cohesion measures obtained from Coh-Metrix are not indicative of the quality of essays as determined by human scorers as given for these essays.

T1  - Understanding Undergraduate Science Majors' Conceptual Knowledge of Ecology: Progressions and Misconceptions
AN  - 1813304469
AB  - The purpose of this research was to gain an in-depth understanding of undergraduate science majors’ conceptual knowledge of ecology. Two separate but related studies were conducted to further explore how ecological knowledge develops as students progress through their undergraduate biology curriculum and how a student-centered teaching strategy may influence development of conceptual knowledge of ecology.    The first study examined what ecological misconceptions students have when beginning undergraduate science programs as well as how their conceptual knowledge of ecology changes over the course of their degree programs. A quantitative, cross-sectional methodology was utilized by administering an ecology misconceptions assessment to at seven different time points during the students’ (n = 195) academic careers. Results revealed that some students have common misconceptions when they begin their undergraduate science program and those misconceptions are persistent. The most frequent misconceptions are concepts, such as energy and matter, that are taught beginning in elementary school. However, students are developing a conceptual understanding as they progress through their undergraduate programs. Implications of this study include a need for instructors to identify misconceptions of students but also to design instruction that addresses common ecology misconceptions.    The second study explored how student-centered collaborative group work affected students’ conceptual understanding of ecological concepts and misconceptions. Students completed concept mapping activities as individual assignments then collaboratively completed the mapping again in their respective groups. A mixed methodology was used which included quantitative concept maps scores of complexity and accuracy along with qualitative data from three case studies. There were no differences in accuracy scores but individual maps were found to be more complex than groups. Three cases examined provided insight into group structure and interactions related to conceptual understanding of ecology. Results of this study revealed that Concept mapping activities may help students develop a deeper conceptual understanding of ecology. However, different methods of using collaborative group work strategies to understand ecological misconceptions specifically should be explored.

T1  - Building the Foundation: Utilizing Concept Maps to Enhance Critical Thinking in First Semester Nursing Students
AN  - 1805571153
AB  - Critical thinking and clinical decision making are essential components of the knowledge and skills necessary for all nurses in order to make complex decisions that improve patient outcomes, safety, and quality of nursing care. Promoting student competence in critical thinking skills is imperative for nurse educators. Concept mapping is an active teaching strategy that can assist nurse educators in preparing nursing students to think critically in today’s complex health care environment. The purpose of this project was to implement concept maps as an additional instructional activity with first semester Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) students to promote confidence in basic critical thinking skills. It was foreseen the first semester ADN student would demonstrate beginning skills in concept map development anticipated to lead to critical thinking applicable in the practice of nursing.

T1  - Nursing Distance Learning Course Comparison of Assignments and Examination Scores
AN  - 1803636282
AB  - Nursing programs have embraced distance learning in their curricula, but discussion is ongoing about course assignments and grading criteria to increase examination scores in nursing distance learning courses.  Because course examinations are a predictor of success on the postgraduate licensing examination (NCLEX-RN), the purpose of this study was to determine whether differences existed in student examination scores between nursing distance learning courses with and without points aligned to assignments.  The theoretical framework was Knowles’s theory of andragogy, which highlights adults’ motivation and self-direction to succeed.  The quantitative causal comparative study included a convenience sample of 164 students to compare archival data of 4 examination scores between 2 nursing distance-learning courses.  Data analysis included an independent-groups one-tailed  t test. No significant differences were found between the 2 courses, suggesting that students do not achieve higher examination scores with course points aligned with course assignments.  Nursing administrators and faculty in nursing programs with a distance learning component will benefit from the findings of this study.  Findings may be used to draft, revise, and implement assignment criteria and point alignment for nursing distance learning courses.  Social change will occur when nursing distance learning faculty use problem-solving and critical thinking assignments, including case studies, discussion boards, group assignments, concept mapping and NCLEX-RN style testing in each nursing distance learning course.  Because point alignment to course assignments do not significantly improve examination scores, implementation of problem-solving and critical thinking assignments is necessary to promote student learning and examination success.

T1  - New methods for analyzing semantic graph based assessments in science education
AN  - 1797588610
AB  - This research investigated how the scoring of semantic graphs (known by many as concept maps) could be improved and automated in order to address issues of inter-rater reliability and scalability. As part of the NSF funded SENSE-IT project to introduce secondary school science students to sensor networks (NSF Grant No. 0833440), semantic graphs illustrating how temperature change affects water ecology were collected from 221 students across 16 schools. The graphing task did not constrain students’ use of terms, as is often done with semantic graph based assessment due to coding and scoring concerns. The graphing software used provided real-time feedback to help students learn how to construct graphs, stay on topic and effectively communicate ideas. The collected graphs were scored by human raters using assessment methods expected to boost reliability, which included adaptations of traditional holistic and propositional scoring methods, use of expert raters, topical rubrics, and criterion graphs. High levels of inter-rater reliability were achieved, demonstrating that vocabulary constraints may not be necessary after all.    To investigate a new approach to automating the scoring of graphs, thirty-two different graph features characterizing graphs’ structure, semantics, configuration and process of construction were then used to predict human raters’ scoring of graphs in order to identify feature patterns correlated to raters’ evaluations of graphs’ topical accuracy and complexity. Results led to the development of a regression model able to predict raters’ scoring with 77% accuracy, with 46% accuracy expected when used to score new sets of graphs, as estimated via cross-validation tests. Although such performance is comparable to other graph and essay based scoring systems, cross-context testing of the model and methods used to develop it would be needed before it could be recommended for widespread use. Still, the findings suggest techniques for improving the reliability and scalability of semantic graph based assessments without requiring constraint of how ideas are expressed.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping applied in case studies in prenursing students' learning and perceptions of learning
AN  - 1791141676
AB  - In nursing education, there is a need for effective educational strategies to foster nursing students’ knowledge, skills, and abilities that are required to succeed in the NCLEX-RN examination and to provide quality nursing care in the healthcare environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of concept mapping applied in case studies on nursing students’ learning and perceptions of learning. This study used a quasi-experimental, quantitative, comparative pre- and posttest research design that had a convenience sample of 93 prenursing students consisting of 53 subjects in the experimental group and 40 subjects in the control group. The experimental group used concept mapping applied in case studies as an educational strategy while the control group used only case studies. Scores on two content tests of the experimental group were compared with those of the control group by using a MANOVA to compare the groups’ learning. The participants’ perceptions of learning promoted by concept mapping applied in case studies in comparison with that promoted by using case study alone were collected through a survey and analyzed descriptively.    The results indicated that there were no significant differences in achievement between participants who used concept mapping applied in the case studies and those who used only the case studies. Also, there were no significant differences in achievement on each of the content tests associated with the case studies between participants who used concept mapping applied in the case studies and those who used only the case studies. The findings of this study might be derived from several factors such as the circumstance of conducting this study, the participants’ perceptions and comfort level with participating in this study, seriousness in taking tests, the brevity of the experiment, and participants’ developmental stages.    Other results of this study indicated that students felt they gained better skills in working effectively with others through concept mapping as applied in the case studies as compared to having case studies only. Students also agreed that they gained a better understanding of how studying nursing helps people address real world issues through concept mapping as applied in the case studies as compared to having only case studies. Moreover, the felt they gained a better understanding of how to use a critical approach to analyze data and arguments in daily life through concept mapping as applied in the case studies as compared to having only case studies. These findings may be due to tasks that are involved in developing concept maps, a deep approach promoted by concept mapping, and the effect of concept mapping that promotes critical thinking. Concept mapping applied in case studies can be used to develop students’ analysis, problem solving, and teamwork skills.

T1  - Chinese grandparents in Chinese-Caucasian biracial families: Grandparents' ethnic & racial socialization of their biracial grandchildren in the San Francisco Bay area
AN  - 1781235682
AB  - This dissertation was a qualitative, exploratory and phenomenological study on how mono racial Chinese grandparents racially and ethnically socialize their Chinese-White biracial grandchildren. Participants included thirteen grandmothers, five grandfathers, and fourteen biracial grandchildren. All participants were living in the San Francisco Bay Area. Interviews were conducted with grandparents and their grandchildren to determine grandparents’ racial and ethnic socialization methods as well as how biracial grandchildren responded to their grandparents and how they viewed themselves as biracial individuals in the U.S. The study also considered the effect of the ecological context on socialization. The two main theoretical frameworks used in this study included: Bronfenbrenner’s ecological theory and Root’s “border crossings” theory. Other biracial identity theories, such as Poston’s BIDM and Rockquemore and Laszloffy’s COBI were mentioned as well.    This study had two main goals: 1.) Providing an examination of how Chinese grandparents have addressed their grandchildren’s biracial status, how they ethnically and racially socialize their biracial grandchildren, as well as the challenges that they have faced in the socialization process; and 2.) How biracial grandchildren view their grandparents and ecological systems in their process of racial and ethnic socialization.     This study’s findings have shown the various ways in which grandparents and ecological contexts have influenced their biracial grandchildren’s ethnic and racial socialization. Some of these ways included: 1.) The types of racial socialization used, including promotion of egalitarianism, promotion of mistrust, and preparation for bias; 2.) Grandparents defining their own identities; 3.) The influence of growing up in the Bay Area’s schools, neighborhoods and communities; 4.) Influence of inherited traits such as one’s physical appearance (phenotype) and birth order and; 5.) Grandparents’ ethnic socialization in terms of cultural activities and practices.    A concept map was created to show the linkages between these various factors in grandparents’ ethnic and racial socialization of their biracial grandchildren. The study’s findings could be used to help inform family service agencies and health professionals better understand and work with biracial families, especially as the United States’ racial demographics continue to change over the following decades.

T1  - Assessing the Use of Concept Maps in the Science Classroom
AN  - 2674895851
AB  - Graphic organizers have been used in the classroom since the late 1960’s. Several studies have been published on the effects of graphic organizers on cognitive learning and yet the traditional method of teaching in the science classroom still remains strongly focused on traditional lecture and note taking. This study shows that relative to traditional methods graphic organizers maintain equivalent learning gains, but increase excitement and engagement among the students.The purpose of this study was to assess traditional lecture vs. traditional lecture with the addition of concept maps to determine if concept maps affect learning gains in the high school science classroom. The study used 86 traditional Biology students. The students were given both a pre-test and post-test on two separate units in the Biology curriculum. The first unit covered Charles Darwin and the theory of natural selection, while the second unit covered the muscular and skeletal systems. Although there was a slight increase in learning gains when concept maps were used, statistical analysis determined that this small increase was not significant for this sample size. There was a statistically significant difference in learning gains between the two units however. An attitudinal survey given at the end of the course showed that students preferred using the concept maps in addition to traditional lecture over traditional lecture alone.

T1  - Creating Independence Through Student-Owned Strategies (Project CRISS): Educator Accounts of the Impact of Project CRISS on Student Learning
AN  - 1789602868
AB  - This mixed-methods study documented the experiences of educators who had used the Project CRISS Program. The program had been implemented since 2001 in Bay District Schools, in Florida. However, educator experiences about the program were not available for future program implementation decisions. Teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators completed a quantitative and qualitative questionnaire about the Project CRISS Program. An analysis of the quantitative data included using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 22.0). Descriptive statistics were reported and analyzed for the survey items using a Likert-type scale. The constant comparison method was used to analyze the qualitative data. Survey items with short answer responses, as well as comments made on the open-ended questions, were transcribed.   Findings revealed educators’ observations about the Project CRISS Program. Educators observed that prior to implementing Project CRISS, students had experienced difficulty with outlining, note taking, text marking, and highlighting text. Educators observed that after implementing Project CRISS, students increased in their use of content-specific vocabulary, concept mapping for better understanding, and vocabulary to help them elaborate and write in complete sentences. Consequently, students increased their learning confidence as well as competence, and the educators believed that the students assumed more control of their learning. The most frequently implemented Project CRISS strategies were the active strategies of graphic organizers, KWL and KWL+, Venn diagrams, anticipation guides, one-sentence summaries, and picture notes. Educators also observed that students could use 2- and 3- column notes, selective highlighting, and concept maps independently. Recommendations for practice included suggestions for teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators for implementing Project CRISS strategies at the highest level. Future research studies about the Project CRISS program were recommended for Bay District Schools in Florida to provide insights into implementing the program at the highest level.

T1  - Flow Charts to Improve Health Information Exchange in Long-Term Care
AN  - 1758894773
AB  - In February 2009 President Obama signed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, as a central part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  Administered by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), this act contains specific incentives which are designed to accelerate adoption of health information technology (HIT) by the health care industry, health care providers, consumers, and patients (US Department of Health and Human Services, [(DHHS)], 2014).   According to the ONC, health information exchange (HIE) allows healthcare professionals and patients to electronically access and securely share patients’ medical information.   HIE helps to ensure communication between providers along the healthcare spectrum and foster continuity of care while reducing costs and duplicated work.  Unfortunately, barriers remain to establishing HIE between long-term care facilities and other healthcare providers.  Key functions for HIE include referrals to long-term acute care (LTAC), discharges and transfers from hospitals to  LTAC, and transfers from LTAC to acute care or home and community- based services, (DHHS, 2013).  The most feasible means to provide optimal care for patients in the above care scenarios is communication between all providers from each treating healthcare organization. This project helped healthcare professionals in long-term care facilities optimize HIE at point of care transition.  In this project concept, maps were used as tools to enhance communication between providers in a three care scenarios that was discussed.  A power point presentation was created to educate staff in long-term care facilities on the importance of HIE, and the concept maps themselves. Ultimately, the goal was to provide quality care resulting in better healthcare outcomes by using HIE.

T1  - The impact of concept mapping as a learning tool on student perceptions of and experiences with introductory statistics
AN  - 1754643495
AB  - The ability to understand and utilize statistics concepts and techniques is paramount in today’s data-rich society. However, research suggests widespread difficulties and misconceptions as well as prevalent affective challenges, such as anxiety and lack of confidence, in the learning of basic statistics concepts at all levels of education. The purpose of this study was to document the experience of incorporating concept mapping as a learning tool to augment the learning of students in an undergraduate introductory statistics course in an adult learning setting. The study explored students’ experiences with concept mapping as a learning tool and examined the impact of this use of concept mapping on student perception by addressing the following questions: (a) How do students experience the learning of introductory statistical concepts through the use of concept mapping? (b) How do students in an introductory statistics course perceive the impact of their use of concept mapping on their ability to relate and apply important statistical concepts? Case study methodology was followed and data included observations, interviews, documents, questionnaires, and reflective journals. These data were analyzed in order to produce a detailed narrative describing the participants’ experiences and perceptions regarding the impact of concept mapping on the learning of basic statistics concepts and to illuminate meaningful patterns from the participants’ perspectives and experiences. Findings suggest students have mixed experiences with the use of concept mapping, and they felt their ability to integrate statistical concepts was enhanced through concept map use, but not their ability to apply concepts for problem-solving.

T1  - The impact of structured prebriefing on nursing students' competency performance, clinical judgment and experience in simulation
AN  - 1752401439
AB  - AIM To examine the intervention of structured prebriefing, for its effect on students’ simulation performance and their prebriefing experience. Prebriefing is the introductory phase of the simulation process.    BACKGROUND Despite its inclusion in the simulation process, little research is available on prebriefing. Reflection theory and concept mapping informed a model-based structured prebriefing activity for preparing students for meaningful learning in simulation.    METHOD A group-randomized, experimental study of 76 baccalaureate nursing students compared competency performance, clinical judgment, and the perception of the prebriefing experience of those receiving structured prebriefing, to those receiving traditional prebriefing activities. The relationship between simulation performance and students’ self-rated prebriefing experience was also examined.    RESULTS A statistically significant difference was demonstrated between groups for competency performance (p < .001), clinical judgment (p < .001) and prebriefing experience (p < .001). No relationship was found between perception of prebriefing experience and students’ simulation performance.     CONCLUSION Structured prebriefing may impact nursing student competency performance, clinical judgment and perceptions of prebriefing, and meaningful simulation learning.

T1  - Using Differential Sequence Mining to Associate Patterns of Interactions in Concept Mapping Activity with Dimensions of Collaborative Process
AN  - 1748663961
AB  - Computer supported collaborative learning (CSCL) has made great inroads in classroom teaching marked by the use of tools and technologies to support and enhance collaborative learning. Computer mediated learning environments produce large amounts of data, capturing student interactions, which can be used to analyze students’ learning behaviors (Martinez-Maldonado et al., 2013a). The analysis of the process of collaboration is an active area of research in CSCL. Contributing towards this area, Meier et al. (2007) defined nine dimensions and gave a rating scheme to assess the quality of collaboration. This thesis aims to extract and examine frequent patterns of students’ interactions that characterize strong and weak groups across the above dimensions. To achieve this, an exploratory data mining technique, differential sequence mining, was employed using data from a collaborative concept mapping activity where collaboration amongst students was facilitated by an interactive tabletop. The results associate frequent patterns of collaborative concept mapping process with some of the dimensions assessing the quality of collaboration. The analysis of associating these patterns with the dimensions of collaboration is theoretically grounded, considering aspects of collaborative learning, concept mapping, communication, group cognition and information processing. The results are preliminary but still demonstrate the potential of associating frequent patterns of interactions with strong and weak groups across specific dimensions of collaboration, which is relevant for students, teachers, and researchers to monitor the process of collaborative learning. The frequent patterns for strong groups reflected conformance to the process of conversation for dimensions related to “communication” aspect of collaboration. In terms of the concept mapping sub-processes the frequent patterns for strong groups reflect the presentation phase of conversation with processes like talking, sharing individual maps while constructing the groups concept map followed by short utterances which represents the acceptance phase.   For “joint information processing” aspect of collaboration, the frequent patterns for strong groups were marked by learners’ contributing more upon each other’s work. In terms of the concept mapping sub-processes the frequent patterns were marked by learners adding links to each other’s concepts or working with each other’s concepts, while revising the group concept map.

T1  - Critical Thinking Development in Undergraduate Dental Hygiene Students
AN  - 1748615427
AB  - Dental hygiene students must embody effective critical thinking skills in order to provide evidence-based comprehensive patient care. The problem addressed in this study it was not known if and to what extent concept mapping and reflective journaling activities embedded in a curriculum over a 4-week period, impacted the critical thinking skills of 22 first and second-year dental hygiene students attending a community college in the Midwest. The overarching research questions were: what is the effect of concept mapping, and what is the effect of reflective journaling on the level of critical thinking skills of first and second year dental hygiene students? This quantitative study employed a quasi-experimental, pretest-posttest design. Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) assessed students’ mean scores of critical thinking on the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) pretest and posttest for the concept mapping and reflective journaling treatment groups. The results of the study found an increase in CCTST posttest scores with the use of both concept mapping and reflective journaling. However, the increase in scores was not found to be statistically significant. Hence, this study identified concept mapping using Ausubel’s assimilation theory and reflective journaling incorporating Johns’s revision of Carper’s patterns of knowing as potential instructional strategies and theoretical models to enhance undergraduate students’ critical thinking skills. More research is required in this area to draw further conclusions.     Keywords: Critical thinking, critical thinking development, critical thinking skills, instructional strategies, concept mapping, reflective journaling, dental hygiene, college students.

T1  - Speech-Language Pathologists on Multicultural Counseling Competency
AN  - 1735793193
AB  - Despite reports of speech-language pathology graduate-level programs focusing on multicultural competence, the literature suggests speech-language pathologists are not adequately educated and trained to be culturally competent. The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of public school-based speech-language pathologists’ graduate-level academic instruction and the clinical practicum experiences in multicultural competence, specifically in the area of multicultural counseling. Guided by the theory of multicultural counseling and therapy, this study used a phenomenological approach, employing semistructured, in-person interviews with 7 participants. The inclusion criteria used for selecting study participants included: having a master’s degree in speech-language pathology, graduation from an accredited, graduate-level speech-language pathology program, certification by American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, employment as a speech-language pathologist for at least 2 years, and employment within the public school setting for at least 2 years at the time of the study. Concept mapping was used to analyze the participants’ responses which allowed the organization of themes and subthemes that emerged. The analyzed data revealed the 7 participants shared experiences and perceptions in the following 5 themes: (a) the role of clinical practicum supervisors, (b) the approaches used to address multicultural counseling in academic instruction and clinical practicum experiences, (c) the influences in developing cultural competence, (d) feelings of preparedness once in the workplace, and (e) the effect adjustment counseling has on service delivery. The findings of this study support the need for more focus on multicultural competency in the area of multicultural counseling in the academic instruction and clinical practicum experiences of speech-language pathologists programs.

AB  - Concept mapping methodology was used to explore the perceived effects of teaching and/or practicing yoga with the Africa Yoga Project (AYP) - a health promotion program that trains and funds Kenyans to teach yoga throughout Kenya. Anecdotal evidence and preliminary qualitative research suggested the AYP meaningfully impacted teachers trained. This study constituted a more in-depth investigation of teachers' experiences. Of the AYP's 72 teachers, 52 and 48 teachers participated in Phases I and II, respectively. Phase I brainstorming resulted in 93 teacher-generated statements about their perceived change. Phase II participants sorted and rated statements in terms of importance. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of sort data was used to map and group statements into clusters. Based on statistical and interpretive criteria, a 12-cluster solution with the following concepts was identified as the best model of teachers' change: Identity as a Yoga Teacher; Prosocial Development; Existential Possibility; Genuine Positive Regard; Value and Respect for Others (highest importance); Presence, Acceptance and Competence; Service and Trust; Non-judgment and Emotion Regulation (lowest importance); Engagement and Connection; Interpersonal Effectiveness; Psychosocial Functioning; and Physical Competence and Security. Overall, teachers reported positive perceptions of the AYP. Additional research is needed to quantify teachers' change and compare the AYP outcomes to those of other health promotion programs.

T1  - Exploring enacted mental models of learning outcomes assessment in higher education
AN  - 1734103555
AB  - This study explored thinking and activity, or enacted mental models, of faculty and staff who have some experience with learning outcomes assessment in higher education. Interviews and concept maps were used to surface various influences, descriptions of actions, and connections between actions for 12 participants occupying either staff or faculty roles. All participants were known to have engaged in learning outcomes assessment. Important outcomes include descriptions and categorization of influences labeled disciplinary training and socialization, environmental and cultural influences, and incentives and accountability. Also found were motivating factors for conducting assessment and common assessment mindset patterns that influenced behavior. By supporting connected mindsets in assessment, various behavior changes can be encouraged to help identify the value of institutional learning outcomes to multiple stakeholders. Findings point assessment leaders toward adjustments to assessment-related training and professional development to better incorporate or consider individual mental models about their own influences of training, their current environment, and relationships to accountability. This study contributes to literature and practice by describing discrete influences on assessment and how influences work together in various formats to result in various assessment mindsets across levels of an institution.

T1  - The Salient Map Analysis for Research and Teaching (SMART) method: Powerful potential as a formative assessment in the biomedical sciences
AN  - 1732684207
AB  - This dissertation consists of two studies: 1) development and characterization of the Salient Map Analysis for Research and Teaching (SMART) method as a formative assessment tool and 2) a case study exploring how a paramedic instructor’s beliefs about learners affect her utilization of the SMART method and vice versa.    The first study explored: How can a novel concept map analysis method be designed as an effective formative assessment tool? The SMART method improves upon existing concept map analysis methods because it does not require hierarchically structured concept maps and it preserves the rich content of the maps instead of reducing each map down to a numerical score. The SMART method is performed by comparing a set of students’ maps to each other and to an instructor’s map. The resulting composite map depicts, in percentages and highlighted colors, the similarities and differences between all of the maps. Some advantages of the SMART method as a formative assessment tool include its ability to highlight changes across time, problematic or alternative conceptions, and patterns of student responses at a glance.    Study two explored: How do a paramedic instructor’s beliefs about students and learning affect—and become affected by—her use of the SMART method as a formative assessment tool? This case study of Angel, an expert paramedic instructor, begins to address a gap in the emergency medical services (EMS) education literature, which contains almost no research on teachers or pedagogy. Angel and I worked together as participant co-researchers (Heron & Reason, 1997) exploring the affordances of the SMART method. This study, based on those interactions with Angel, involved using open coding to identify themes (Strauss & Corbin, 1998) from Angel’s views of students and use of the SMART method. Angel views learning as a sense-making process. She has a multi-faceted view of her students as novices and invests substantial time trying to understand their concept maps. Not only do these beliefs affect her use of the SMART method; in addition, her beliefs are refined through the use of the SMART method.

T1  - A Study of Concept Mapping as an Instructional Intervention in an Undergraduate General Chemistry Calorimetry Laboratory
AN  - 1730332701
AB  - This investigation, rooted in both chemistry and education, considers outcomes occurring in a small-scale study in which concept mapping was used as an instructional intervention in an undergraduate calorimetry laboratory.  A quasi-experimental, multiple-methods approach was employed since the research questions posed in this study warranted the use of both qualitative and quantitative perspectives and evaluations.   For the intervention group of students, a convenience sample, post-lab concept maps, written discussions, quiz responses and learning surveys were characterized and evaluated.  Archived quiz responses for non-intervention students were also analyzed for comparison.  Students uniquely constructed individual concept maps containing incorrect, conceptually correct and "scientifically thin" calorimetry characterizations.    Students more greatly emphasized mathematical relationships and equations utilized during the calorimetry experiment; the meaning of calorimetry concepts was demonstrated to a lesser extent.

T1  - The use of graphic organizers and interactive design techniques to improve the performance of electronic consenting systems
AN  - 1727779735
AB  - Legal and ethical requirements mandate that all patients be informed of and consent to the details of the medical treatment they may receive or the clinical research trials in which they may participate. The current process of obtaining consent from patients has certain limitations. Researchers have identified that patient understanding of the information presented on the consent form is limited. In this dissertation research, a needs analysis was conducted to identify the user requirements for an electronic consent interface. Two studies were then conducted to evaluate the effect of interface design based on the results of the needs analysis and recent research in the field of education and interactive design on user comprehension of the consent information. The first study investigated the effect of graphic organizers, particularly concept maps and mind maps, on user comprehension and engagement. The results of this study demonstrated improvement in user comprehension when the graphic organizers were used with the consent form, with no significant differences in the workload experienced by the participants.   Three studies were then conducted to explore the value of incorporating two interface design techniques: periodic questioning with feedback, and presentation of the instructional materials in the form of video and audio, with the text-based consent form and concept map. The results of this study demonstrated that consent interfaces with periodic questioning and feedback improved the performance of the electronic consenting system without increasing the workload for the participants. Given the improvement in the performance with consent forms that used graphic organizers and periodic questioning and feedback relative to a text-based consent form, it is recommended that these interface design techniques be used to achieve a consent process that improves both patient engagement with the consenting process and patient comprehension of the procedures for which they are considering giving their consent.

T1  - Positive Mental Health: A Concept Mapping Exploration
AN  - 1725782695
AB  - American Indian (AI) people experience higher rates of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and poor mental health than non-Native Americans.  Despite a 17.1% prevalence of Anishinabe (an indigenous people who live in the Midwest of the United States and Canada) adults living with type 2 diabetes and meeting the PHQ-9 cutoff for depression, half (51.3%) of those surveyed were flourishing according to Keyes’ Mental Health Continuum—Short Form (MHC-SF).  A unique paradox appears to exist for AI people more so than that documented for other groups: despite historical trauma, various social stressors, ongoing marginalization, and depression and chronic diseases, a disproportionately large number of AI people met criteria for flourishing mental health.      In order to better understand Anishinabe concepts of mental wellness and the utility of the MHC in this population, the specific aim of the study was to gain a deeper understanding of indigenous interpretations of positive mental health (PMH) by engaging in a group concept mapping session with Anishinabe community members from two communities.    The resulting concept map varied somewhat from the three aspects of PMH presented in Keyes’ MHC-SF (emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing).  According to the map, PMH included the following clusters: 1) Values Gained with Maturity, 2) Motivated, 3) Traditional Spirituality/Culture, 4) Culturally Competent/Accept Others, 5) Take Care of Self, 6) Financial Health/Organized, 7) Ethical/Moral Leadership, 8) Community, and 9) Family/Relationships.  Many of the clusters were related at least in part to the MHC-SF, but some differences were evident.  Additionally, themes of harmony and balance, resilience and coping, and connection and interconnectedness, while not found in the MHC-SF, were prominent aspects in this concept map, lending support to their importance in indigenous PMH.  Overall, the theme of interconnection is key to understanding the results of the concept map.     The focus of this study fulfilled calls for strengths-based (as opposed to deficit-based) research for indigenous people.  This was significant not only for better understanding Anishinabe perspectives of PMH, but also for understanding the ways in which all groups of people can learn lessons about PMH through cross-cultural research.

T1  - Attentional guidance and media presentation during explicit instruction
AN  - 1725214731
AB  - While much is known about how certain types of images influence learning in multimedia educational systems, comparatively little work has been done on how different image types compare to each other in terms of the types of knowledge conveyed and transfer of knowledge. Two popular types of media found in many multimedia environments, pictures and concept maps, are capable of blending verbal information (such as in picture labels or node/link labels) and visual information (such as structural information) into a single image, which may result in increased exposure to vocabulary (improving learning) or may create split attention (decreasing learning). Both types can also be presented using animation techniques, although questions remain as to whether animation always improves learning in different kinds of media. This study explores media differences and animation techniques in two experiments, both of which utilize Khan Academy lessons as the basis for the multimedia presentation. In the first experiment, a 2x2 between-subjects design was utilized to examine different media types (labeled pictures vs. concept maps) and animation (animated vs. static). The results of this study indicate that animation improves relational knowledge and free recall scores, but an animation x media type interaction indicates that animated pictures are not very effective for conveying conceptual knowledge. In Study 2, a 2x2 between-subjects experiment dove deeper into the function of "labels" by examining how animation (animated vs. static) and labels (present vs. absent) interact, as both may be attention directing devices. It was found that animation and prior knowledge both had consistent effects on learning, where those with high prior knowledge did not gain as much from viewing an animated presentation as those with low prior knowledge did, but labels had minimal effects on learning. In all, research indicates that different media should be used depending on the educational goals, animation may be particularly helpful for low prior knowledge students, and labels are not necessarily helpful for learning when the same information is presented orally.

T1  - A Case Study of Respect Among Young Urban African American Men
AN  - 1707690876
AB  - Many young adult African American men living in urban areas adopt a style of self-presentation known as the gangsta image in an attempt to earn and maintain what they may perceive to be respect, self-esteem, and social status. While these young men succeed in earning the respect of their peers, they also may jeopardize their chances of succeeding in mainstream society by engaging in an alienating lifestyle related to their alternative form of status. The purpose of this case study was to explore the concepts of respect and self-esteem as defined by a culture-sharing group of young African American men living in an urban environment. Using the theoretical lens of Goffman’s dramaturgical model of social interactions, case studies of 4 young African American males’ experience of self-esteem and respect as components of social acceptance were explored. Their sources of teachings about respect and social position received from the authority figures in their environment, as well as the contextual factors that shaped their self-concept, were also delineated. The research used a qualitative, case study design. Data were collected from observations, interviews, participatory photography, and document review and analyzed by coding and concept mapping using Atlas.ti software. The key finding was that perceptions of self-respect were connected to ongoing negative relationships with mainstream society and law enforcement. This study contributes to social change by helping human services professionals to comprehend the meaning and significance of respect and self-esteem for this population. This understanding can then inform practices related to engaging and supporting the mainstream success of this important group.

T1  - Concept Mapping as a Tool for Enhancing Self-Paced Learning in a Distance Scenario
AN  - 1686122821
AB  - Researchers have determined that concept maps serve as effective tools in the traditional science classroom. The purpose of this experimental study was to investigate concept mapping as a tool for student knowledge acquisition in 10th grade science for students in distance learning situations. Research questions were designed to investigate the influence of concept mapping on rate and quality of student knowledge acquisition and retention. This study was a pretest-posttest 2-group comparison study, constructivist in nature and based on the theory of cognitive learning. Participants included 36 students in the 10th grade at an inner-city school in the United States. Control and treatment groups participated in completing pre and posttesting to establish standards for initial understanding and knowledge acquired. Pretest scores were used in a 2-tailed t test to establish equivalence between groups at the beginning of the study. ANOVA was used with test gains to determine differences between treatment and control groups. Cronbach’s alpha was conducted to test for concept map interrater reliability. A 2-tailed  t test for matched groups was used with concept map scores and treatment group test gains to determine any relationship. No statistically significant relationship between the use of concept maps and distance learning was found. Recommendations for future research include a wider age range for participants and investigations of academic areas such as reading, writing, mathematics, and language acquisition, native and foreign. Implications for positive social change include research with altered parameters to identify an existing tool that may be used by students in the traditional classroom as well as in distance-learning scenarios.

T1  - Exploring New York City School Gardens: The Development of the School Garden Integration Framework and Strategies of Operationalization by Well-Integrated Gardens Using a Sequential, Transformative Mixed Methods Approach
AN  - 1682043953
AB  - Objective: Previous studies have explored impacts of school gardening on students and detailed broad components needed for successful gardens, but little is known about how gardens are maintained, connected academically, valued, and sustained over time. The purpose of this observational study is to explore how school gardens become institutionalized and create an implementation framework that can be used to establish gardens that are well integrated into curriculum and culture.     Study Design, Setting, Participants, Intervention: A stratified, purposeful sample of school gardeners at 21 Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Bronx schools completed a survey, semi-structured interviews, and concept mapping exercises during the 2013-2014 school year.  Additional data collected were student observations, garden images, and related documents.     Outcome Measures and Analysis: The survey was analyzed using descriptive statistics.  Interviews, photos, observations and documents were qualitatively analyzed through thematic coding, pattern matching, explanation building, and cross-case synthesis.  Concept mapping exercises was analyzed quantitatively by entering participants’ sorted statements into a similarity matrix to conduct multi-dimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis and qualitatively by thematic coding.     Results: Survey, interview and observation data explicated how school gardeners used implementation strategies to overcome barriers, create new learning opportunities for students, and facilitate permeation of gardening into the school culture. The quantitative concept mapping analysis resulted in four school garden domains (resources and support, physical garden, student experience, and school community) and 19 domain components.  Qualitative analysis of sorted statements and interviews elucidated relationships between each domain’s components and also the domains to each other.  An integration of all data produced a rich description, supplemented with images, of each school garden’s unique and varied characteristics, activities and operation. A synthesis of these analyses produced the School Garden Integration Framework (SGIF), which visually depicts how and when to implement each domain and all components to maximize garden integration.  Additionally, a scaled tool (Scale) was created to capture and rate varying degrees of domain and component integration.     Conclusion and Implications: The SGIF, Scale, and implementation strategies that emerged from this study can be used by schools or policymakers to strengthen existing or establish new well-integrated school gardening programs.

T1  - Narratives of the Maps: Emirati Undergraduate Students’ Stories of National Identity
AN  - 2878254325
AB  - In 1971, the rulers of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) put their national dreams forward and celebrated the federation of the UAE. Since then, the UAE has changed rapidly to become a globalised country that aspires to achieve international prominence, thereby affecting Emiratis and exposing them to external factors at odds with Emirati values emerging from Muslim and Arab culture. This has caused great concern regarding Emirati youth national identities, and the possibility that they are building weak understandings of their culture and citizenship. This doctoral thesis explores four Emirati female undergraduate students’ experiences of national identity through cultural and political symbols.The theoretical framework is a synthesis of Mead’s (1934) and Goffman’s (1959) symbolic interactionism and Moscovici’s (1988) social representation theory. The study follows a social constructivist methodology based on narrative and ethnography using participant observations, ethnographic interviews, and visual methods to create stories of national identity experiences. The findings demonstrate that the students’ experience of national identities in everyday contexts included socially interacting with cultural and political symbols producing an internalised image of the UAE they relate to their objectives and future ambitions. Recommendations include addressing further research and theoretical implications of identity studies in the region, reviewing higher education curricula and youth programmes, as well as the need for a comprehensive cultural strategy in the UAE.

T1  - E-Textbook Evaluation Study
AN  - 2781089156
AB  - The effects that technological advances have on education and how these advances can be used to improve the learning process are important research questions that attract many researchers to study different aspects of these issues. One such aspect is the development of interactive e-textbooks. Interactive e-textbooks are defined as electronic books that go beyond the static nature of printed textbooks. In this study, an e-textbook was developed that uses JavaScript for its interactive elements, and employs a concept map for navigational purposes. This e-textbook prototype was tested for the purpose of answering the following research questions. Does an e-textbook improve a student's learning as measured by his/her performance in a test? Does an e-textbook improve a student's learning and performance better than a printed textbook? Do students like interacting with the interface of an e-textbook and does it increase a student's engagement with the course material? Results showed that undergraduate students' performance improved after using the e-textbook. Results also showed that both undergraduate students and graduate students had a positive reaction to the e-textbook.

T1  - Exploring Occupation as a Determinant of Health and its Contribution to Understanding Health Inequities
AN  - 2701131264
AB  - Within health literature, occupation is understood as employment whereas in occupational science the concept of occupation encompasses all the things that people want or need to do. The objective of this pragmatic-oriented, qualitative study was to elicit the perspectives of occupational scientists on occupation as a determinant of health or concept that shapes health and well-being and secondly, to identify questions from an occupational lens to address health inequities in health assessments and interventions. Purposive sampling was used to recruit occupational science experts and data were collected through focus groups. Eight occupational scientists participated. A thematic analysis of data was conducted and a visual concept map was constructed to identify relationships between themes. Findings were organized into two central themes: (a) differentiating occupation; concepts that define occupation outside of just employment, and (b) connecting occupation to health; concepts that are health promoting, jeopardizing, or depriving. Occupational questions were offered for use alongside health assessments, particularly the Health Equity Impact Assessment (HEIA). A holistic and non-structural occupational perspective may broaden the interdisciplinary knowledge needed to understand complex and hidden sources of health inequities.

AB  - We attack the problem of learning concepts automatically from noisy Web image search results. The idea is based on discovering common characteristics shared among category images by posing two novel methods that are able to organise the data while eliminating irrelevant instances. We propose a novel clustering and outlier detection method, namely Concept Map (CMAP). Given an image collection returned for a concept query, CMAP provides clusters pruned from outliers. Each cluster is used to train a model representing a different characteristics of the concept. One another method is Association through Model Evolution (AME). It prunes the data in an iterative manner and it progressively finds better set of images with an evaluational score computed for each iteration. The idea is based on capturing discriminativeness and representativeness of each instance against large number of random images and eliminating the outliers. The final model is used for classification of novel images. These two methods are applied on different benchmark problems and we observed compelling or better results compared to state of art methods.Alternate abstract:Bu calışmada görsel konseptlerin otomatik olarak internet kaynaklı imgeler kul- lanılarak öğrenilmesi üzerine çalışılmıştır. Sunulan iki yeni yöntem ile bir konsept için edinilmiş imge koleksyonundaki ortak özellikleri kullanarak, ilgisiz imgeleri elemek ve imgeleri görsel bütünlük içinde gruplanmak amaçlanmıştır. İlk olarak, yeni bir veri öbekleme ve ilintisiz veri eleme yöntemi Konsept Haritası (Concept Map - CMAP) sunulmuştur. CMAP verileri öbeklere ayınrken, ilgisiz verileri bu öbeklere olan ben- zerliklerine göre eler. Daha sonrasında, CMAP'in bir konsept için ürettiği her bir veri öbeğinden, konseptin değişik bir alt kümesini tanımlayan, birer model öğrenilir. Diğer bir yöntem, Model Evrimi ile Eşleme (Association through Model Evolution - AME), imgelerin rasgele alınmış büyük bir imge kümesi ile farklarını yinelemeli bir yöntem ile ölçer. Bu ölçümlere dayanarak, her yinelemede, yeni bir grup ilintisiz imge elenir. AME her bir imgenin, rasgele alınmış büyük bir imge kümesine karşı, ait olduğu konsept için ayrımsallık ve temsil edebilirlik özelliklerini teşhis eder. Bu özellikleri göz önüne alarak, ilitisiz imgeleri bulur. En son aşamada, temizlenmiş imge setleri üzerinden hesaplanmış modeller ile, yeni imgeler üzerinde konseptsel sımıflandırma yapılır. Sunulan iki yeni yöntem de bilindik veri setleri ve problemler üzerinde sınanmıştır. Sonuçlar bilindik en iyi yötemler ile kıyaslanabilir değerler ver- mektedir.

T1  - The Effect of Computer Science on Physics Learning in a Computational Science Environment
AN  - 2088030035
AB  - College and high-school students face many difficulties when dealing with physics principles and concepts, such as a lack of understanding of the components of formulas or of the physical relationships between the two sides of the formulas. To overcome these difficulties some instructors suggest combining design of simulations while learning physics, claiming that the programming process forces the students to understand the physical mechanism activating the simulation. The current research investigated the physics learning taking place while programming physics simulations. In particular, it explored how programming and computer science (CS) affect physics learning taking place in a unique context, a computational-science course where the physics learning was not one of the goals of the course thus not extensively addressed.   This study examined the physics learning of computational-science students. It reports on findings obtained from the analysis of the discourse of pairs of students while developing computational models of physics phenomena. The following three learning aspects were examined: (a) The physics conceptual understanding achieved by the students. The students' conceptual knowledge in physics was evaluated at the beginning and at the end of developing the models, and at different stages in between. Concept maps (Novak & Cañas, 2008) were used to represent the students' knowledge. (b) The effect of CS on the evolution in students' conceptual knowledge in physics was evaluated using the Knowledge Integration (KI) framework (Linn & Eylon, 2006, 2011), which describes four thinking processes that students should undergo to experience meaningful learning. (c) The problem-solving (PS) behaviors employed by the students and the effect of CS on them were evaluated using the Epistemic Games framework (Tuminaro, 2004; Tuminaro & Redish, 2007) which describes coherent activities that are used for creating knowledge or solving a problem. (d) The effect of CS on students' ability to think at different levels of abstraction in physics. The framework of Epistemic Games (Tuminaro, 2004; Tuminaro & Redish, 2007) was used for this purpose as well.   Findings revealed that the computational-science students gained physics knowledge that is reported to be difficult for high-school and even undergraduate students. Four different domains that exist in CS were found to trigger physics learning: structural knowledge, procedural knowledge and systemic knowledge that deal with knowledge representation, and the execution domain that enables reflection on the represented knowledge.   The computational environment in general, and CS in particular, was most of the time the trigger of the students' application of high-level PS behaviors. In some cases, however, the difficulty of combining physics with CS led the students to apply low-level PS behaviors.   Moving between levels of abstraction in CS was found to encourage the students to move between levels of abstraction in physics. The need to develop computational models encouraged the students to apply higher levels of abstraction in physics, mainly during the development and exploration of equations. At the same time, students moved between the higher level of abstraction in CS—developing the interface—and the lower level of activating it as code.   In general, CS was found to affect physics learning in both positive and negative ways. It seems that combining CS and physics was difficult for the students, but it was also the catalyst to effective learning. Instructional implications and limitations of the research are discussed.

T1  - The role of team cognition in collaborative information seeking during team decision-making
AN  - 1872599178
AB  - Team decision-making is a process composed of many activities. One important activity is collaborative information seeking (CIS). CIS takes place when  “two or more individuals work together to seek needed information in order to satisfy a goal” (Karunakaran & Reddy, 2012). Consequently, CIS can play an important role in team decision-making. Current CIS research has focused on (1) examining the social and interactional aspects of CIS in organizational and other settings and (2) developing technical approaches to support CIS activities. However, most CIS research has overlooked the  cognitive aspects of CIS. In particular, there is little research examining CIS from a team cognitive perspective.   Often, the development of team cognition positively improves the team decision-making process (Cooke et al., 2003). Specifically, the development of team mental models, a team cognitive construct, has often been identified as a way to help teams complete their work (Lim & Klein, 2006). However, the relationship of CIS and team cognition has never fully been explored.    In this dissertation, my four main research objectives were to (a) explore how teams approach CIS; (b) develop a conceptual understanding of team cognition during CIS; (c) understand the impact and affect of a co-located and distributed setting on team’s CIS approaches and the development of team cognition, and (d) develop design guidelines for information technologies that will support multiple CIS approaches and the development of team cognition during CIS. To meet my research objectives, I conducted two separate qualitative laboratory studies of undergraduate student teams engaged in multiple CIS tasks. The first study focused on co-located, synchronous CIS. In this study, I utilized qualitative methods such as cognitive interviews, observations, and concept mapping to examine how teams approached CIS and to identify if and how team cognition developed during CIS activities. The second study examined teams using a collaborative system in a distributed, synchronous CIS environment. The second study employed cognitive interviewing to investigate CIS approaches and team cognition in the distributed environment.   Through these studies, I make contributions to three different research fields—(1) Human Factors, (2) Information Sciences, and (3) Computer Supported Cooperative Work. Specifically, I (1) identify different approaches that teams take to CIS, (2) explain the role and development of team cognition in CIS, and (3) describe how teams approach CIS and develop team cognition in both the co-located and distributed environments. Through this research, I hope to further our empirical understanding of CIS especially in regards to cognition. I also hope to provide some design guidance for the development of more effective CIS tools that account for the role of team cognition.

T1  - Computer aided learning within pre-clinical veterinary training: animal welfare assessment teaching prior to farm placement
AN  - 1827600867
AB  - Veterinary graduates require skills in animal observation. The aim Of this mixed methods study was to develop and validate a new educational resource which improved animal observation skills amongst pre-clinical veterinary students. A new Computer Aided Learning (CAL) resource provided pre-clinical extra mural students (PC EMS) with an opportunity to practise animal welfare assessment and had six sections; an on-line lecture, a quiz, animal observation videos, a decision -making section, "test yourself" video clips and a concept map. The CAL was informed by Kolb's cycle of experiential learning. Validation of the CAL involved a detailed, quantitative blind assessment of the content of farm reports submitted by all students post-placement. The assessment criteria for the categories were based upon the Bloom's Revised Taxonomy. CAL training prior to farm placement improved the ability of students to assess and report animal welfare as part of their pre-clinical extra mural experience. A qualitative focus group also reported finding the CAL easy to use. Three successive years of students demonstrated improved reporting of animal based measurements for each of the five freedoms following CAL training. Students were found to employ a combination of objective (quantitative) and subjective (qualitative) measures when assessing animal welfare using the CAL. More than two-thirds of the students who completed a survey following the CAL reported that it was informative and a useful addition to the pre-existing PC EMS course. Furthermore, many students re used the CAL of their own volition following initial training. Collectively, these findings show that the new CAL improved students' ability to report animal based measurements when reviewing animal welfare and was viewed positively by many of its users. The CAL has formed part of the veterinary curriculum at the University of Bristol since its validation in 2010 and is currently readily available to other British veterinary schools.

T1  - Perceived health status, health values and health goals as influences on individual pursuit of DTC genome testing: Implications for healthcare of ill & healthy
AN  - 1824673787
AB  - This dissertation examines an individual's perceived health status, and health values, as influences on self-initiated health action, specifically the pursuit of Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genome testing.  Motivation for this independent health action may also have implications for other individual health behaviors, including the potential for positive changes that are lasting rather than temporary.  Health Capability, the conceptual framework, supports individual health values and goals, ability to access valued healthcare services and includes measures of health status.  However, Health Capability lacks an operationalized mapping of its major concepts.  This dissertation proposes and evaluates an original concept mapping and relationships.     An overview of this dissertation and components is presented in Chapter one.  Chapter two addresses the genomics and healthcare landscape related to independent individual pursuit of Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genome testing.  The Health Capability framework is initially presented in this chapter, together with the research hypotheses, targeted literature review of key concepts and the proposed concept mapping with relationships.  Chapter three describes the Health Capability conceptual framework, its adaptation and extension for the dissertation and its potential for use in health promotion and prevention research.  A systematic review of the literature on perceived health status is discussed in chapter four, as well as a targeted review of approaches to concept measurement and most commonly used instruments.      Chapter Five presents the dissertation study.  This research involves 1455 self-initiated Direct-to-consumer (DTC) genome testing users who represent a naturally occurring phenomenon and provide a unique population to study the impact of an individual's subjective perceived health status, personal health values and health goals.  Participants completed surveys as part of the Impact of Personal Genomics (PGen) study.  These participants were classified into four mutually exclusive health status groups based on individual perception of health and a healthcare system perspective of health status (existence of a medical diagnosis).  These groups were analyzed for the following:  1) discrepancies in health status, 2) differences in reasons for genome testing, perceived risk and health values, and 3) potential relationships among variables.  Results confirmed discrepancies between individual and biomedical health status.  One group may represent the "worried well".  Interest in health information was high (98-99%) across all groups, as was health value of genome test results.  Two items distinguished all groups (interest in pharmacogenomics information and learning risk for other diseases (p < .001).  When groups differed, perceived rather than biomedical health status was often involved, yet both factors demonstrated influences (variable dependent).  Risk perception was moderately correlated (.301) with health status group, yet clearly does not equate with perceived health.  Persons with medical diagnoses and self-rated not good health scored highest for items relating to immediate personal health and for family.  Study findings are consistent with individual perceived health status and health values as significant factors influencing self-initiated health action (DTC genome testing).      Chapter six further interprets research results as they relate to the hypotheses and to future research plans.  Implications of the study results for revision and extension of the Health Capability concept mapping and framework are also discussed.  These include: 1) supporting health status and values as principle concepts; 2) supporting addition of a measure of individual (subjective) perceived health status; 3) representing resources outside the healthcare system; and, 4) exploring the possibility of a personal need or value, as a "trigger" to action.  These are areas of planned further research relevant to personalized healthcare, effective clinical practice, a collaborative healthcare model and meaningful policy development.

T1  - Exploring science teachers' pedagogical content knowledge in the teaching of genetics in Swaziland
AN  - 1710742139
AB  - Recent trends show that learners’ enrolment and performance in science at secondary school level is dwindling. Some science topics including genetics in biology are said to be difficult for learners to learn and thus they perform poorly in examinations. Teacher knowledge base, particularly topic-specific pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), has been identified by many researchers as an important factor that is linked with learner understanding and achievement in science. This qualitative study was an attempt to explore the PCK of four successful biology teachers and how they developed it in the context of teaching genetics. The purposive sampling technique was employed to select the participating teachers based on their schools’ performance in biology public examinations and recommendations by science specialists and school principals. Pedagogical content knowledge was used as a theoretical framework for the study, which guided the inquiry in data collection, analysis and discussion of the research findings. The study adopted the case study method and various sources of evidence including concept maps, lesson plans, pre-lesson interviews, lesson observations, post-teaching teacher questionnaire, post-lesson interviews and document analysis were used to collect data on teachers’ PCK as well as how PCK was assumed to have developed.   The data were analysed in an attempt to determine the individual teachers’ school genetics’ content knowledge, related knowledge of instructional strategies and knowledge of learners’ preconceptions and learning difficulties. The analysis involved an iterative process of coding data into PCK categories of content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of learners’ preconceptions and learning difficulties. The findings of the study indicate that the four successful biology teachers generally have the necessary content knowledge of school genetics, used certain topic-specific instructional strategies, but lacked knowledge of genetics-related learners’ preconceptions and learning difficulties despite having taught the topic for many years. There were some instructional deficits in their approaches and techniques in teaching genetics. The teachers failed to use physical models, teacher demonstration and/or learner experimentation in their lessons (or include them in their lesson plans) to assist learners in visualizing or internalizing the genetics concepts or processes located at the sub-microscopic level. The teachers’ PCK in genetics teaching was assumed to have developed mainly through formal university education programmes, classroom teaching experiences, peer support and participation in in-service workshops. The implications for biology teacher education are also discussed.

T1  - The Effect on Students' Mathematical Beliefs by Integrating History of Mathematics in the Classroom
AN  - 1673623663
AB  - This study, with an analysis of over 40 empirical researches about the history of mathematics teaching, discovered that only a few studies conducted research about the evolution and development of history of mathematics and they seldom analysed students’ mathematical beliefs. In order to fill the gap, this study is aimed to design the topic of function through the perspective of the evolution and development, namely from the Babylonian tables to discontinuous function. It also seeks to explore how that affects students' mathematical beliefs including math fun, math humane scale, mathematical evolution, and students’ views of mathematics.    The study was conducted among two classes of F.4 students who have the similar mathematics abilities in a local secondary school. One is the experimental group and another one is the reference group. The teaching materials developed by the researcher were used in the experimental group while the textbooks were used in the reference group.   Through cognitive tests, questionnaires, interviews, concept maps and teacher journals, the way in which the history of mathematics affects students’ mathematical beliefs is explored. The subsequent analysis of the data attempts to answer the following questions: How the history of mathematics affects students' mathematical cognitive level? How history of mathematics affects students' mathematics attitudes? What difficulties the teacher suffers when using this teaching material? Are there any differences between the normal teaching and history of mathematics teaching? Are there any changes in teacher’s mathematical belief? Is it appropriate to conduct history of mathematics teaching in senior form?    This study discovers that history of mathematics has different effects on students of various mathematical abilities. When selecting the material of history of mathematics, stakeholders need to pay attention to students’ mathematics abilities and interests as well as make appropriate adjustments to teaching, so that students of different mathematical ability can obtain different levels of expansion on their mathematical beliefs.

T1  - A Vygotskian analysis of preservice teachers' conceptions of dissolving and density
AN  - 1668086962
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the content knowledge of 64 elementary preservice teachers for the concepts of dissolving and density. Vygotsky’s (1987) theory of concept development was used as a framework to categorize concepts and misconceptions resulting from evidences of preservice teacher knowledge including pre/post concept maps, writing artifacts, pre/post face-to-face interviews, examination results, and drawings.    Statistical significances were found for pre- and post-concept map scores for dissolving (t = -5.773, p < 0.001) and density (t = -2.948, p = 0.005). As measured using Cohen’s d values, increases in mean scores showed a medium-large effect size for (dissolving) and a small effect size for density. The triangulated results using all data types revealed that preservice teachers held several robust misconceptions about dissolving including the explanation that dissolving is a breakdown of substances, a formation of mixtures, and/or involves chemical change. Most preservice teachers relied on concrete concepts (such as rate or solubility) to explain dissolving. With regard to density, preservice teachers held two robust misconceptions including confusing density with buoyancy to explain the phenomena of floating and sinking, and confusing density with heaviness, mass, and weight. Most preservice teachers gained one concept for density, the density algorithm.    Most preservice teachers who participated in this study demonstrated Vygotsky’s notion of complex thinking and were unable to transform their thinking to the scientific conceptual level. That is, they were unable to articulate an understanding of either the process of dissolving or density that included a unified system of knowledge characterized as abstract, generalizable and hierarchical. Results suggest the need to instruct preservice elementary science teachers about the particulate nature of matter, intermolecular forces, and the Archimedes' principle.

T1  - Medication management training for mental health professionals: a programme of research
AN  - 1654747826
AB  - Aim This research programme aimed to investigate issues relating to the management of patient non-adherence with antipsychotic medication. The findings from the patient-related studies and the systematic literature review informed the development of a medication management staff training programme; which was evaluated in terms of the effects on mental health professionals’ understanding and clinical practice in Hong Kong. Background Medication management interventions which are designed to maximise the potential benefits of antipsychotic medication for severe mental illness have shown promise in improving symptoms, reducing relapse rates and addressing non-adherence. Subsequent medication management studies which involve training mental health professionals in similar psychosocial interventions have also demonstrated that improvements in mental health professionals’ knowledge, attitudes and skills can result in improved patient outcomes; however, the studies have not been replicated outside western general psychiatry settings and therefore the effects of training mental health professionals in other clinical contexts have not been established. Methods This research programme consists of a series of five studies that utilised a variety of methodological approaches. Three cross-sectional surveys were used to identify and explore clinical problems central to medication management in order to refine the staff training programme; the first investigates the extent of, and associations with, antipsychotic medication non-adherence in prisons. Qualitative interview data from the prison study provides additional context to the requirements for medication management training interventions by exploring prisoners’ experiences of taking antipsychotic medication. The second survey ascertains and explores the problem of non-adherence with antipsychotics in an Asian population, and the third provides an estimate of potential treatment-related physical health problems. A systematic literature review investigates studies which measure the effects of medication management training on clinicians’ knowledge, attitudes and skills. Finally concept mapping and clinicians’ narratives are used in a longitudinal case series 2 study in order to establish the transferability of medication management training to an Asian setting and evaluate the effects of training on clinicians’ understanding and clinical practice. Results Patients’ positive attitudes towards antipsychotic medication, particularly awareness of the need for treatment predicted higher levels of adherence, and concerns about the adverse effects of these medications are closely related to the environmental context of treatment. Concerns associated with antipsychotic side effects appear to be less prominent when patients are not working or in prison but they may influence adherence when demands on functioning change. The modified medication management training was effective in improving clinicians’ understanding and was felt to be transferrable to an Asian setting, but patients’ and families’ traditional cultural beliefs about mental illness and concerns about the effects of western medication on physical health were found to be particular challenges when implementing adherence interventions. Patients with severe mental illness in Hong Kong are twice as likely compared to the general population to have developed metabolic syndrome, consequently medication management interventions could require greater focus on the identification and management of physical health problems; which may help to address patient and family concerns about long-term treatment. The staff training programme requires psychopharmacology teaching, provision of clinical supervision and side effects management content in order to improve clinicians’ confidence when implementing medication management interventions. Conclusions Concerns about the adverse effects of treatment that influence adherence are environmentally bound. As influences on medication adherence are different in different settings, staff training programmes should place more emphasis on the local context in order to improve efficacy and the feasibility of implementation. The results suggest that in Hong Kong medication management interventions should have an increased focus on families and that treatment satisfaction could be a suitable target for interventions. The findings also present a question about whether previous medication management studies have given due consideration to predicting and managing concerns about the impact of side effects on functioning over the longer term and the potential effects of medication on patients’ physical well-being. The outcomes of this programme also demonstrate that future medication management training studies need to use robust study designs in order to more certainly attribute clinicians’ improvements to the training intervention and could consider measuring treatment satisfaction as a primary patient outcome measure.

T1  - Conservation engineering outreach: Curriculum development and evaluation of Smart Fishing in the Bering Sea
AN  - 1647758290
AB  - The purpose of this project to was to 1) develop, 2) instruct, 3) evaluate, and   4) revise a 5th-12th grade fisheries conservation engineering outreach program entitled Smart Fishing and the Bering Sea (SFBS).   Fishery resources are important to Alaska and Alaskans, but present complex conservation challenges including user conflicts and concerns about unsustainable fishing practices. Increasing Alaska residents' environmental literacy will enhance natural resource management decisions regarding fisheries.   The intent of the SFBS program is to introduce students to ecological and economical factors that drive conservation engineering in the Bering Sea pollock fishery.  I instructed the SFBS program to 93 students from four different public and private institutions in Anchorage, Alaska.  My observations and participants' pre- and post-program concept maps were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SFBS curriculum. Participants gained content knowledge from this fishery outreach program about the Bering Sea and commercial fishing.  Program evaluation analysis and results were used to revise the curriculum and make suggestions to SFBS stakeholders.

T1  - Combinatorial Graph Creation and Navigation for Blind People
AN  - 1642723083
AB  - Combinatorial graphs, often conveyed by node-link diagrams, figure prominently in computer science and other Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Graphs are also important in other areas as well as in everyday life. Entity relationship diagrams, finite-state machines, various Universal Modeling Language (UML) diagrams, resource-allocation graphs, flow charts, chemical molecules, biological taxonomies, concept maps, organizational charts, family trees, etc., are all represented using (combinatorial) graphs. Unfortunately, these representations are often inaccessible to blind students and professionals forming a barrier between them and active participation in STEM and other fields. Our goal is to help remove that barrier by providing blind people with the means to independently create and use graphs in a variety of disciplines for knowledge representation and problem solving, and to easily share them with sighted people.    Others have developed applications specifically and exclusively to give blind users access to graphs, but separate applications are often not equal, and have the added disadvantage of segregating blind users. These applications do not allow blind users to easily share their graphs with sighted colleagues, if at all. Some require the use of specialized hardware such as joy sticks, stereo headphones, and tactile pads. The contribution of our research is the development of a universally accessible Graph SKetching tool known as GSK, which adheres to Universal Design principles by providing blind and sighted users with the means to create, access, and immediately share graphs using Input/Output devices that are standard for them — the keyboard, mouse, monitor, and screen reader.    GSK was developed in conjunction with a blind computer science student, who provided crucial insight into the non-visual creation and representation of graphs. A pilot study of his use of GSK in several computer science courses was conducted followed by a user study with ten blind participants. The user study results demonstrate the efficacy of GSK for the examination, navigation, and creation of graphs by blind users. These studies also informed the iterative enhancement of GSK, which improved its efficiency for blind users. The user study and its results provide valuable comparison data for others who may develop similar tools to GSK, and afterwards use our examination, navigation, and/or creation studies to evaluate them. We offer the guidelines used in the creation of GSK for the development of future universally accessible graph tools as well as to aid in making existing graph tools universally accessible.

T1  - The effect of graphic organizers on students' attitudes and academic performance in undergraduate general biology
AN  - 1629828817
AB  - High attrition among undergraduate Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) majors has led national and business leaders in the United States to call for both research and educational reform within the collegiate STEM classrooms. Included among suggestions for reform are ideas to improve retention of first-year students and to improve critical thinking and depth of knowledge, instead of covering large quantities of materials.     Past research on graphic organizers suggest these tools assist students in learning information and facilitate conceptual and critical thinking. Despite their widespread use in high school science departments, collegiate humanities departments, and even medical schools, their use is considerably less prevalent in the undergraduate biology classroom. In addition to their lack of use, little research has been conducted on their academic benefits in the collegiate classroom.     Based on national calls for improving retention among undergraduate STEM majors and research suggesting that academic success during an individual first major's related course highly determine if that individual will continue on in their intended major, the researcher of this dissertation chose to conduct research on an introductory general biology class. Using both quantitative and qualitative methods, the research in this dissertation examines the effectiveness of graphic organizers in promoting academic success and also examines their influence on student attitudes.    This research is grounded in the theories of constructivism and cognitive load theory. Constructivism suggests that individuals must build their knowledge from their personal experiences, while the cognitive load theory recognizes the limited nature of one's working memory and suggests that instructional practices minimize cognitive overload.    The results of this dissertation suggest that the use of graphic organizers in an undergraduate general biology classroom can increase students' academic success when the cognitive load is high; however, when the instructors make effort to reduce cognitive load, while providing the students an opportunity to participate in metacognitive activities and to engage their germane working memory, graphic organizers do not provide an additional benefit to the students.

T1  - Concept mapping: A strategy to increase critical thinking in nursing students: An action research study
AN  - 1626381135
AB  - This Action Research Project examined the strategy of concept mapping and its influence on the development of critical thinking in first semester junior nursing students. Participants of the study consisted of juniors from a small university that were randomly divided into two groups, control and intervention. The Health Science Reasoning Test (HRST) was used to determine the critical thinking of both groups before and after the intervention. Data was gathered and analyzed to determine the impact of concept mapping on the critical thinking skills. The scores from the HRST, the exam grades pre and post intervention, and a survey to determine the participant's perceptions about concept mapping. The results showed no significant increases in critical thinking or exam scores. The self-reporting of participants on the survey ranged from concept maps were seen as very useful to participants unable to discern any benefits from the concept maps produced. Although the study did not provide the anticipated results the study may add to the body of knowledge in a limited fashion and direct others in the design of future studies.

T1  - Identification of School Physical Activity Leader Competencies Using Concept Mapping
AN  - 1617534221
AB  - Background/Purpose: Various public health and educational organizations have called for the implementation of comprehensive approaches at the state, district, and school levels to promote physical education and physical activity among children and adolescents. Proponents have argued that physical education teachers are positioned to assume the role of director of physical activity in the school setting; however many physical educators do not see directing comprehensive school physical activity programs (CSPAP) as their responsibility, nor have they been formally trained to provide this measure of leadership.  Furthermore, there is limited research on CSPAPs and the associated leadership roles integral to planning, implementing, managing, and evaluating change in this area. The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify the knowledge, skills, and behavioral competencies that a school leader would need to develop in order to implement and sustain a CSPAP.       Method: Researchers used an integrated approach to concept mapping that involved brainstorming, statement analysis and synthesis, sorting and rating of ideas, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis, and development and interpretation of multiple graphic organizers. These steps were delivered in sequential phases using a web-based communication platform: anonymous brainstorming (n=51), sorting and rating of ideas by key stakeholders ( n=18), and interpretation of maps through semi-structured interviews (n=3). The participants across all phases included K-12 physical educators, school administrators, and higher education researchers identified through systematic review of the literature and snowball sampling.    Analysis/Results: Data aggregation and analysis were completed using multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis to determine relationships among brainstormed statements. A variety of maps were developed to graphically display these relationships. Five primary clusters of ideas were identified: (1) Teambuilding and Facilitating, (2) Capacity Building, (3) Knowledge of Instructional Practices, (4) Content Knowledge, and (5) Program Development and Management. Data from the semi-structured interviews were analyzed inductively and used to verify results, determine final cluster names, and identify possible implications for teacher preparation.    Conclusions: The findings support the need for the development of transformational leaders in schools who are capable of empowering others through modification of the work environment, facilitating intrinsic motivation among colleagues, and supplying necessary resources. Teacher education and educational leadership programs have an opportunity to help develop transformational leaders in the area of school physical activity by modifying curricula to provide opportunities for pre-service and in-service teachers to develop the knowledge, skills and behaviors pre-requisite to the implementation and maintenance of CSPAPs within school environments.

T1  - Development of a concept exploration based teaching methodology for undergraduate chemistry education
AN  - 1613217276
AB  - Science in general has traditionally been noted as a difficult subject because of its specialized language, mathematical and abstract concepts, and the amount of content to be learned in a semester. In particular, students are believed to base their attitudes towards science-related disciplines on their perceived abilities in understanding or succeeding in a course. Other factors may also contribute to this lack of interest, such as students' metacognitive skills. Concept mapping and computer-aided tools may be used to assist students in building hierarchical knowledge bases that allow them to visually represent connections between concepts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of students using alternative learning aids (concept maps, ontology) to traditional learning aids used in an introductory chemistry course.     This study consisted of three phases of implementation (control, treatment 1, and treatment 2 groups) over a three semester period. Phase 1 consisted of the control group, phase 2 consisted of the first treatment group with the addition of the four concept mapping homework assignments in the curriculum and phase 3 consisted of the second treatment group with the integration of the same four concept mapping assignments as phase 2 with the addition of using the Creonto "Intro Chemistry" ontology software.     Students in all three phases were assessed using standardized examination questions that were based on the four concept mapping topics and pre- and post-surveys administered at the beginning and end of the semester. Students in phase 2 and 3 groups were also assessed from their constructed concept maps to measure their abilities to explain connections between key concepts.     The results of this study suggest that students who created concept maps using the Creonto "Intro Chemistry" software performed better on exams and were able to make more connections when creating concept maps compared to students who did not create concept maps or use computers to assist them. For the exams, there was a statistically significant difference between treatment groups' exams 1 and 3 mean scores. For the concept maps, there was a statistically significant difference in students' abilities to explain connections between key concepts. There was no statistically significant difference in attitudes toward chemistry between groups in this study. However, there was a significant statistical difference in metacognitive skills between the groups. More research is needed to gain a better insight into factors that might have affected students in the course.

T1  - Asian anthropogenic lead contamination in the North Pacific Ocean as evidenced by stable lead isotopic compositions
AN  - 1564215263
AB  - This dissertation work determined the changing scope of lead (Pb) contamination in the North Pacific Ocean since the phase-out of leaded gasoline in most of the world. Chapters 1 and 2 consisted of validating our method for determining Pb concentrations and isotopic compositions in seawater. Chapter 3 established a baseline of Pb isotopic compositions (PbICs) in the western and central North Pacific in 2002. This was an ideal time to establish such a baseline because China had recently (mid-2000) ceased their use of leaded gasoline and simultaneously began consuming increasingly large amounts of coal, known to have relatively high Pb concentrations. We found subsurface waters were contaminated with Asian industrial Pb, predominantly Chinese coal emissions. In contrast, the abyssal waters were a mix of Asian industrial Pb and background (i.e., natural) Pb.      Chapter 4 revisited the western and central North Pacific in 2009 – 2011 to determine what, if any, changes had occurred in this short time period. We found that Pb in subsurface and abyssal waters of the western North Pacific were similar to Chinese aerosols. Such a large change in the PbICs of abyssal water in 9 years was unanticipated and attributed to the relatively large flux of particle-bound Pb from the euphotic zone to the deep ocean, which was in isotopic equilibrium with the reservoir of dissolved Pb. In contrast, the central North Pacific abyssal water PbICs were similar to values previously reported because of the relatively lower particulate export. Based on comparisons to baseline PbIC data, we determined that abyssal waters in the western and central North Pacific would be isotopically indistinguishable from surface waters in the next three decades.      Sources of Pb to coastal California waters were reevaluated in Chapter 5. Prior studies had found that surface waters of the California Current System (CCS) were isotopically consistent with both Asian industrial Pb and US leaded gasoline, still in use at that point in time. In 2010 and 2011, we found that surface and subsurface waters of the CCS were isotopically similar to Asian industrial emissions. However, remobilized US gasoline Pb from sediments in the San Francisco Bay, California, were accumulating in the "mud belt" on the continental shelf and changing the isotopic composition of overlying waters. During periods of intense upwelling, this historic Pb was brought to the surface of the water. However, the much larger quantity of Pb from Asian industrial emissions made the isotopic composition of Pb from historic US gasoline unidentifiable in off-shore waters.      A secondary research focus of this dissertation was to improve my own teaching abilities. Chapter 6 explored the intersection of system thinking and aquatic toxicology in undergraduate education. Among a wealth of information, I found that group concept mapping was no more useful to student learning than the same activity done individually. This was due to poor implementation of team learning strategies by me and inadequate time for students to adjust to non-traditional instruction methodologies.

T1  - Evaluation of Growing Strong Bodies and Minds: A literacy-based nutrition education curriculum for young children
AN  - 1562505002
AB  - Growing Strong Bodies and Minds curriculum is a nutrition education program for pre-kindergarten through second grade children that integrates nutrition messages into literacy curriculum (Hildebrand et al., 2009). While the curriculum meets the needs of classroom teachers in teaching core literacy competencies it has not been evaluated for effectiveness in increasing knowledge of food groups in this young age group. Concept mapping has been used in assessing students' learning without requiring the student to read or write. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Growing Strong Bodies and Minds curriculum to increase knowledge of food groups in pre-kindergarten through second grade. Trained teachers and student teachers in a rural area elementary school taught the curriculum and assessed learning with concept maps.   Six classrooms consisting of 149 children divided into 39 groups participated in the study. Teachers completed concept maps with each group asking what types of foods students would choose for lunch before and after teaching the curriculum. Hierarchical Structure Scores (HSS) were calculated by adding depth and width of each map. A change variable for depth, width, and HSS was computed by subtracting the pre from post score. Differences in change scores were assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey post hoc. A paired sample t-test was conducted to compare pre and post depth, width and HSS within each grade. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank non-parametric analysis was also conducted. The ANOVA indicated a difference in depth with first grade being significantly different from pre-kindergarten and second grade. The paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests confirmed the increase in first grade depth scores. However, mean depth changes in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and second grade were not significant. Furthermore, mean width changes and mean HSS changes for all grades were not significant. Further research is needed to understand why knowledge changes occurred in the first grade but not in any other grade.

T1  - The Effects of Different Types of Frequent Summative Testing on Student Achievement in First-Year Financial Accounting Courses
AN  - 1561161405
AB  - Despite the literature supporting formative testing, most college professors viewed testing only as summative, a means of assigning grades, and believed that an emphasis on summative testing obscured the promotion of learning, which resulted in the use of testing less frequently or sometimes never. The problem was that financial accounting instructors did not know whether a course curriculum that included summative testing, multiple-choice quizzes or short-answer quizzes, or a curriculum that did not include summative testing would enhance student learning of first-year financial accounting information.  A study to test the effects of different forms of summative testing on student achievement in first-year financial accounting courses was conducted using data collected from 45 non-randomly selected and conveniently available participants, a convenience sample, comprised of students enrolled in first-year Financial Accounting courses.  To answer the research questions, a quasi-experimental, between-subject and repeated measures research design was employed.  A quantitative research method was necessary for the proposed study because an examination of the relationship between different forms of frequent summative testing and student achievement in first-year financial accounting courses using mid-term and final exam scores was desired.  The data was examined using a mixed-design ANOVA and revealed that the main effect of group (treatment) was significant,  F(2, 42) = 9.054, p < .05, meaning that the scores were different across the treatment groups.  The pairwise comparisons indicated that the group receiving no quiz treatment achieved significantly different exam scores than the group receiving the multiple-choice treatment,  p = .001.  The data supported the use of frequent testing, multiple-choice quizzes, to enhance student learning of accounting information.  Frequent testing should begin early in the course in order to encourage early and continuous benefits from the testing effect.  Instructors should utilize quiz questions that are similar but not exactly the same as the mid-term and final exam questions to promote transfer, the use of learned material to solve novel problems.  Further research is needed to establish whether second, third, and fourth-year accounting students benefit from frequent testing.  A study investigating the effects of frequent testing on student achievement in online versus residential accounting courses would also be beneficial.

T1  - Trainee teachers' understandings of news stories about science: beyond ideas about uncertainty
AN  - 1557570775
AB  - This study explores how science and history trainee teachers, who have different amounts of higher education in science, respond to news reports about science. In semi-structured interviews, using researcher and reader selected articles, readers were asked about the likelihood of veracity of knowledge claims and also their reactions to what they read. The thesis reports a range of heuristics which served to increase, or decrease, epistemic distance and so make the reader more or less willing to accept scientific claims as true. The quality of participants’ responses to news stories was also examined by using concepts maps to identify the extent to which ideas were interconnected. Concept maps were found to have a networked structures for both groups of participants, however, there was limited evidence for participant use of ‘ideas about interconnectedness’, thus there was limited evidence of epistemic thinking. The veracity of news stories is largely indeterminate for the non-expert reader given the limited information contained in the story and so readers’ multiple understandings are emphasised. Overall, there was not much difference between the two groups of readers.

T1  - Content-based curriculum versus concept-based curriculum: A retrospective causal comparative study to identify impact on the development of critical thinking
AN  - 1556660780
AB  - The focus of this causal comparative research was the level of development of critical thinking among associate degree nursing students in an adult medical-surgical course who received concept-based curriculum as compared to students who had received the traditional content-based curriculum. There is evidence that both content-based and concept-based curricula serve to accomplish the same results on the National Council of Licensure Examination (NCLEX) for registered nurses, today's registered nurse graduate is required to have developed critical thinking (reasoning) and clinical judgment that is acquired during the nursing program through clinical venues, classroom experiences and simulation experiences. The focus of this research was to determine the impact that concept-based curriculum had on the development of critical thinking in the classroom and was measured through identified test items on unit exams and the standardized final exam sub-score of Critical Thinking. The results of the study support the conclusion that a concept-based curriculum is more effective than a content-based curriculum in helping students develop critical thinking (reasoning) and clinical judgment based on nursing concepts and concept mapping during classroom sessions. A limitation of this study was that only one medical-surgical course was examined; further studies should include more courses during the associate degree nursing program.

T1  - Effects of Concept Mapping on the Critical Thinking Skills of Baccalaureate Nursing Students
AN  - 1552723008
AB  - Traditional teaching techniques which promote mostly memorization do not help nursing students think critically and solve problems in the clinical setting. The lecture needs to be replaced with evidenced-based methods of improving critical thinking skills of nursing students. The conceptual framework for this exploratory study was based on Ausubel’s theory of meaningful learning, which generated concept mapping. Using a nonexperimental, pretest-posttest design the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether concept maps can be used as a teaching strategy to improve the critical thinking of entry-level nursing students. The research questions were used to determine the difference in overall critical thinking scores as well as individual domain scores (analysis, interpretation, inference, evaluation, explanation, and deductive and inductive reasoning) before and after concept map treatment during a 14-weeek clinical session. The California Critical Thinking Skills instrument was used with a convenience sample of 40 nursing students entering a nursing program. Although overall critical thinking scores increased, paired t test results indicated the difference was not statistically significant. Subscores, however, indicated significant gains in the evaluation domain. Further longitudinal research is needed to test the effect of integrating concept mapping throughout the nursing curriculum on students’ critical thinking. Social change begins when the student is able to connect theory, content, and practice to clinical problem solving in order to provide the safest and highest quality of care in a time-constrained environment.

T1  - Writing center tutors' perceptions of social justice issues: A multiple method qualitative study
AN  - 1535824293
AB  - Following literature by Grimm (1999), Denny (2010), and Condon (2012), this study explored tutors' perceptions based on Bell's (2007) framework, which described similarities among various manifestations of social injustices, by considering the research question: How do peer tutors experience and conceptualize social justice issues within the context of tutoring sessions in the writing center? Data were collected from eight participants through interviews, concept mapping tasks, and social category ranking tasks, yielding 8.5 hours of audio-recorded data and 145 pages of transcriptions.    Findings included evidence that tutors experience social injustices as occasionally insurmountable barriers to tutoring. This research also revealed that some injustices are more visible to tutors, participants recognized oppression as manifesting in language, some tutors seek explanations for injustices, and most tutors defer to higher authorities (i.e., professors, academic discourse). Based on these findings, I argue that presumptions must be openly discussed and reconceptualized by all writing center stakeholders.

T1  - Promoting Prosocial Behaviors to Prevent Dating Violence Among College Students: Evaluation of a Bystander Intervention
AN  - 1524282734
AB  - The objective of this dissertation was to evaluate a bystander behavior program at the Jefferson College of Health Sciences (JCHS) in Roanoke, Virginia.  Specifically, this dissertation examined the: (1) preliminary measurement properties of a newly developed bystander behavior intention scale; (2) impact of the bystander intervention at JCHS; and (3) underlying processes that influence bystander behaviors.   Approximately 25 percent of college students are in a physically abusive dating relationship (Miller, 2011).  Bystander programs are one strategy to decrease dating violence and increase prosocial behaviors (Banyard, 2008; Banyard, Moynihan, & Plante, 2007; McMahon & Banyard, 2012).  This is one of the first known studies to define bystander behaviors towards dating violence and evaluate a bystander behavior program that was designed to be less resource intensive for college campuses with limited time and funding.      This dissertation used a quasi-experimental study design to evaluate the bystander behavior intervention at JCHS.  The methods of concept mapping and cognitive interviews were used to develop the survey items (Beatty & Willis, 2007; Kane & Trochim, 2006).  Internal consistency of the scale was assessed using Cronbach's alpha and exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to examine the factor structure.  Difference-in-difference methods were used to evaluate the program impact (Wooldridge, 2009), and path analysis was used to examine the factors that drive bystander behaviors (DeVellis, 1991).    First, the EFA identified that bystander behavioral intentions to prevent dating violence represented a uni-dimensional factor structure with strong factor loadings and internal consistency.  Second, using the difference-in-difference method, results showed a positive increase in bystander behaviors before and after the intervention after adjusting for potential confounders.  No significant changes were found for bystander intentions, self-efficacy, social norms, or attitudes pre- and post-intervention.  Third, results from the multivariate path analysis model show that bystander intentions do not mediate the relationship between self-efficacy, social norms, and attitudes and bystander behaviors, as hypothesized by the Integrated Behavioral Model (Fishbein & Ajzen, 2010).  However, results suggest that self-efficacy has a moderately strong direct relationship to bystander behaviors.       These findings show that a less resource intensive intervention can increase bystander behaviors to prevent dating violence.  However, more research is needed to understand the drivers of bystander behaviors, which will help programs target their interventions more effectively in the future.

T1  - Factors Influencing Millennials Theatre Intention: A Partial Least Squares Consumer Behavior Analysis in a Delaware University
AN  - 1497278452
AB  - A Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) consumer behavior analysis was conducted to determine factors influencing theatre intention on Millennials in a Delaware University. The survey-based study was applied to a college alumni population in Northern Delaware and had over 1,300 responses. Results were compared to other generational cohorts to deepen the understanding of their decisions as consumers of theatre. An extensive literature review of over 120 published peer review research papers led to the development of the Performing Arts Consumer Behavior Model. The PACBM was the basis for the application of PLS-SEM. Demographic statistical analysis was performed using SPSS to round up the analysis. The comparison between Millennials and other generational cohorts was conducted via PLS-SEM multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA) parametric approach. Results reflect a solid predictive model indicating that attitude and gender have significant influence on intention to attend theatre. No practical differences were found between Millennials and other generational cohorts in this population relative to theatre intention. Results can be applied to the theatre industry in Delaware to increase demand for the discipline.

T1  - Toward a Systematized Pedagogy of Musical Expression: An Observational Study of Instrumental Teaching
AN  - 2701130207
AB  - Observational studies of instrumental teaching present limited data on the efficiency of various teaching methods (Karlsson & Juslin, 2008; Kennell, 2002). Although technology has been demonstrated to improve emotional communication (Karlsson, 2008), musicians may have a negative attitude toward using it for learning expressive skills (Lindström, Juslin, Bresin, & Williamon, 2003). More studies are needed on the structural aspects of lessons, the dynamics of social interactions, and the prospects of using computer-based instruction in teaching expression (Laukka, 2007). The aims of this thesis are to (a) explore the nature of instrumental teaching with an emphasis on expression, (b) assess how teachers and students conceptualize expression and the teaching of it, and (c) see how they appraise the use of technology in teaching expression. In order to do this, we (a) observed instrumental lessons and (b) interviewed participants (12 university undergraduate students and their teachers: n=6). Interactions from 12 lessons were analyzed based on four educational functions of language (testing, instructional, accompanying, expressive). Results showed that 18% of the lessons were devoted to students' expressive development and that teachers used mainly the verbal mode of communication, in which the outcome feedback strategy was prevalent. Questionnaire responses revealed that expression was the preferred characteristic of music performance and that it was conceived as multidimensional and that the teachers' approach was based on the "instrumental-technical" view. Strategies, such as questioning, experimenting with sound, modeling, and using metaphorical language, are suggested as efficient ways to develop students' own expression. Teachers' interest towards the use of technology to teach expression decreased after they had received information on the underlying mechanisms of the Feel-ME software used, while students' interest remained positive. A concept map that integrates informative feedback and strategies to help students develop their own expression was created as a model for explicit music expression teaching.Alternate abstract:Les études sur l'enseignement instrumental présentent un nombre limité de données concernant l'efficacité des différentes méthodes d'enseignement (Karlsson & Juslin, 2008; Kennell, 2002).  Bien qu'il ait été démontré que la technologie améliore la communication émotionnelle (Karlsson, 2008), les musiciens peuvent avoir une attitude négative envers son utilisation pour l'apprentissage des compétences expressives (Lindström, Juslin, Bresin, & Williamon, 2003).  Davantage d'études doivent être effectuées quant à l'utilisation de la technologie dans l'apprentissage de l'expression (Laukka, 2007).  Les objectifs de cette recherche étaient (a) d'étudier la nature de l'enseignement instrumental, en particulier l'expression, (b) d'évaluer la façon dont les enseignants et les élèves conceptualisent l'expression et son enseignement, et (c) de vérifier les perceptions de l'utilisation de la technologie dans l'enseignement de l'expression. Nous avons (a) observé des leçons instrumentales, et (b) réalisés des entrevues (12 étudiants instrumentistes de premier cycle et leurs enseignants : n = 6). Les interactions entre professeurs et élèves de 12 leçons furent analysées en fonction de quatre fonctions éducatives (test, instruction, accompagnement, expression). Pour la durée totale des cours instrumentaux, 18% fut consacré au développement des compétences expressives.  Les professeurs utilisaient davantage les stratégies verbales pour enseigner l'expression, plus précisément la stratégie «outcome feedback».  Les réponses au questionnaire ont révélé que l'expression, caractéristique la plus appréciée, est définie comme un concept multidimensionnel.  Les stratégies, telles que l'expérimentation sonore, la modélisation, les métaphores, aident à développer l'expression des élèves.  L'intérêt des professeurs quant à l'utilisation de la technologie pour l'enseignement de l'expression a diminué après avoir reçu de l'information concernant le logiciel Feel-ME, tandis que celui des étudiants est demeuré positif.  Un schéma de stratégies comprenant  un feedback informatif est suggéré comme modèle d'enseignement systématique pour aider les étudiants à développer leur expression.

T1  - The Effect of Graphic Organizers on Science Education : Human Body Systems
AN  - 2675220786
AB  - The purpose of this research is to determine whether graphic organizers foster better student achievement in science classrooms than guided note taking with PowerPoint presentations. The study was quantitative. Using approximately 69 high school Biology I students, two body systems were taught using graphic organizers as the main lesson plan tool and two body systems were taught only using a guided notes lecture with PowerPoint. A pre-test and a post-test were administered for each body system studied. Student test scores were evaluated to determine whether knowledge gains differed between the two types of lessons. It was found that the use of graphic organizer instruction was significantly better for student achievement when compared to the use of PowerPoint instruction and that there was much more interaction between student and teacher during the graphic organizer lessons. The delivery of the lesson by the use of graphic organizers seemed to promote more student success than the use of the PowerPoint lesson.

T1  - Soft Matter: Curriculum Design of a Contemporary, Interdisciplinary Science Course for High School Students
AN  - 2088171107
AB  - High school and first year college students usually encounter the concepts and approaches of physics in a traditional curriculum that focuses on simplified systems such as the mechanics of point particles or thermodynamics of ideal gases. Such students rarely have the opportunity to study contemporary, interdisciplinary topics in which physical models are used to analyze complex real-world, interacting multi particle systems. This dissertation describes a design-based research of a curriculum that introduced such an inter-disciplinary topic - the study of soft and biological matter to 11th and 12th grade students.   The first part of the dissertation addresses how the topic of soft matter, typically taught in graduate courses, is adapted to the introductory student level. We begin by introducing the fundamental tenet of soft matter systems analysis: the use of microscopic models, such as the lattice-gas, to quantify macroscopic properties utilizing principles of statistical thermodynamics (e.g. free energy minimization). We then describe how we make the topic accessible to students: first, by presenting it in the curriculum as a generic modeling process analyzing diverse phenomena in a unified manner; and second, through instructional activities such as using concept maps for organizing knowledge and troubleshooting tasks to learn from common mistakes.   The dissertation continues with two empirical studies that focus on two key aspects of student learning in the program: 1. The evolution in students' use of fundamental principles of statistical thermodynamics (such as the 2 nd law of thermodynamics) as the complexity of the systems that were studied and the level of quantitative analysis has increased. 2. The perceptions of scientific modeling that students acquired as they studied soft matter systems in the lessons and after they participated in independent, inquiry projects.   Our analysis of learning in the program is based on authentic classroom data from diagnostic questions, videos of lessons and interviews. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis of student learning, and the role of prior knowledge and epistemology in it, we focused on the statements of case study students, whose performances represent common learning pathways in the program.    We found that several students believed that phenomena in which the entropy of system decreases, contradict the 2nd law of thermodynamics. We suggest that this deficiency is related to student difficulties in integrating energy related concepts, and to an epistemology that allows fundamental scientific laws to be overridden by others. In addition, we found that many students were inclined to interpret the process of modeling soft matter phenomena as a mathematical procedure and disregarded its simplification aspect which precedes the mathematical derivations. We suggest that the simplification aspect did not sufficiently capture the students attention and was therefore disregarded while the mathematical aspects were naturally difficult and provoked student interest. In addition, this deficiency can be related to student perceptions of modeling as a process of replicating real systems in a mathematical form, which might have rendered approximations and simplifications as undesirable.    In the spirit of design-based research, the findings were interpreted in light of the instructional activities and were used to propose strategies to improve instruction in future developments of a similar, interdisciplinary program. In addition, the findings contribute to the understanding of themes such as modeling and statistical thermodynamics that extends beyond the context of this specific design.

T1  - Exploring empowerment in conversation: delivering video interaction guidance to families of children who are deaf or hard of hearing
AN  - 1785481518
AB  - Introduction: This work explored the concept of ‘empowerment’ in health care. A concept map of ‘empowerment’ was generated based on theories of linguistic analysis to locate aspects of empowerment in conversational data. The process of empowerment was understood within the theory of transformative learning as ‘perspective change’. A ten phase model of the transformative learning process was used to provide evidence of perspective transformation. The empowerment process was explored through the delivery of the intervention Video Interaction Guidance to 16 hearing families of pre-lingual deaf children. Methods: The parents of the deaf children and the intervention guide engaged in conversations reviewing video clips of the parent and child in interaction. These conversations were processed through a corpus analysis software programme to discern key extracts of the participants’ conversational data. These extracts were to subject to discourse analysis to find evidence of transformative learning. Analysis: Transformative learning was observed in 10 families. Transcript extracts representing the model of transformative learning were variable. Principles of conversation analysis were applied to explore the learning process in interaction. Participant speech was tagged to assess their level of engagement. Outcomes: The corpus analysis-driven tagging process offers an original approach to representing the key content of large sets of interview data but in this work, was limited in showing how the interaction created opportunities for learning. Transformative learning processes were variable and the ten phase model could not be characterised in terms of discourse features alone. The intervention encouraged critical reflection but warrants directed focus to achieve learning. The participants were effective in acting as co-collaborators in the intervention process. Discussion and concluding remarks: Models of empowerment must focus on the process, of the ways in which the guide and the participant create learning opportunities and evidence of this must be multimodal. Patient-centred interventions should be supported by an open, communicative relationship with the health service provider.

T1  - Effects of an explicit reflective approach on Swaziland pre-service elementary teachers' understanding of the Nature of Science
AN  - 1704850492
AB  - In this study, the effects of an explicit reflective intervention on Swaziland elementary preservice teachers’ understanding of the Nature of Science (NOS) were investigated. The factors that had an impact on the development of participants’ NOS views were also investigated. The intervention made use of de-contextualized and contextualized activities as well as historical narratives as contexts for reflecting about the empirical, creative, subjective as well as the tentative NOS. The intervention included a discussion of the relationships and differences between observations and inferences as well as scientific laws and theories in the context of the aforementioned learning activities.   Participants were 24 elementary pre-service teachers enrolled for their final year of their three year teacher development programme. An adapted version of the Views of Nature of Science Questionnaire-Form C (VNOS-C) was used in conjunction with individual interviews, to assess the participants’ understanding of NOS at the beginning and conclusion of the intervention. At the end of the programme, data from interviews, concept maps and reflective journals of seven participants were analysed to ascertain their perceptions of the elements of the course and other factors that had an impact on their development of more informed NOS views. These participants were selected on the basis of their differential gains in NOS understanding.   The data that was analysed using both qualitative and quantitative techniques revealed that the intervention brought about significant gains in some participants’ understanding of NOS. Information obtained from the document analysis of journals and concept maps as well as exit interviews of the selected group revealed that the pre-service teachers’ development of more informed views was mediated by motivational and cognitive factors. These were the participants’ perception of the value of teaching and learning NOS, their views about teaching and learning science, and their ability to engage deeply with the NOS concepts as well as their epistemic beliefs. The explicit reflective attention to NOS as well as metacognitive strategies was reported by most of the selected participants as responsible for changes in their NOS views.

T1  - A Participatory, Mixed-Methods Assessment of Clinical Ethics Committees: How Might They Support Clinicians and Positively Impact Care?
AN  - 1648135561
AB  - The primary purpose of this exploratory study to learn how clinical ethics committees in one healthcare system might be more effective in supporting clinicians and their work in critical care settings. This study also attempted to address several issues in previous research. First, committees frequently lack information on what they could do to meet the needs of clinicians facing moral dilemmas, making it challenging for committees to be proactive, purposefully choose committee members and determine their training needs, and plan and support relevant services. Second, most needs assessments have solicited a top-down, management perspective rather than the views of constituent stakeholders. Third, ethics committees activities are often inadequately operationalized and difficult to evaluate. Finally, few studies have examined how different committee activities might potentially impact care.    This research was done in partnership with a large healthcare organization in central Ohio. The community partner wanted data that would drive strategic planning, program development, and evaluation for the seven ethics committees in its system. This study used a structured, mixed methodology, concept mapping, which is specifically designed to analyze and integrate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Data was collected from both ethics committee members and a diverse, multi-disciplinary sample of critical care clinicians to generate an inventory of 95 potential committee functions which might support the critical care units. Participants rated each suggestion on two dimensions: potential to positively impact care and perceived current performance by the ethics committees. Rigorous statistical analyses were used to integrate and analyze the data collected. The “concept maps” produced after data analysis graphically displayed multiple dimensions of ethics committee work and performance.    Non committee members organized the suggested committee activities into seven different categories: staff development, guidance, outreach and accessibility, visibility, liaison with system, liaison with patients and families, and ethical and moral support. Individual ideas within each group help operationalize these broader functions and point to potential committee activities beyond the three traditional roles of education, policy development and consultation. Broadly speaking, the participants unaffiliated with ethics committees thought the suggested activities could have more positive impact on patient care than committee members did. Conversely, committee members rated their performance higher than non committee members did. Views about potential impact and perceived current performance varied among the hospitals participating in the rating activity. Within the same hospital, ratings varied among critical care units. A number of other variables - profession, years in healthcare, involvement with ethics committee consults, and use of the ethics committee as the first resource when questions about an ethical dilemma arise – also seemed to influence how ideas were rated. The findings suggest that ethics committees could have a positive impact on care by being more visible and accessible and working directly and proactively with families, particularly around end-of-life dilemmas. Participants also identified a need for interventions which provide staff with moral and ethical support. Social work opportunities for working with ethics committees to address moral and ethical issues, supporting staff emotional needs, and improving communication with families are presented.

T1  - The effect of a computer program designed with constructivist principles for college non-science majors on understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration
AN  - 1553234535
AB  - The primary objective of this project was to learn what effect a computer program would have on academic achievement and attitude toward science of college students enrolled in a biology class for non-science majors.  It became apparent that the instructor also had an effect on attitudes toward science.  The researcher designed a computer program, the CELE program, for use in instruction on photosynthesis and cellular respiration.  The researcher modified existing instruments to assess academic achievement in understanding photosynthesis and cellular respiration and to assess student attitudes toward these topics.  The researcher also used concept maps to assess student understanding of the material.   The CELE program had no significant effect on academic achievement or student attitudes, which was possibly due to students' not engaging with the program as anticipated. The instructor had a significant effect on student attitudes toward photosynthesis and cellular respiration as well as on misconceptions that were not detected on the pretest but were detected on the posttest.

T1  - Promoting Conceptual Understanding via Adaptive Concept Maps
AN  - 1513240803
AB  - The purpose of this study is to explore the feasibility and effectiveness of a scalable concept map based navigation system for a digital textbook. A literature review has been conducted to identify possible methods to promote conceptual understanding in the context of a digital textbook, and these hypothesized solutions will be evaluated through a prototype tool. The primary method that has been selected for this study to promote conceptual understanding in textbooks is the concept map. When concept maps are used as advance organizers or navigation aids for hypermedia documents, they have been shown to promote conceptual understanding. Issues with scalability exist, however. When maps become too large or complicated, a phenomenon labeled “map-shock” occurs. Map-shock is a result of cognitive overload that nullifies the positive effects the concept map has on learning. In order to eliminate map-shock, one needs to manage the cognitive load imposed on the learner. This project proposes using information visualization techniques leveraged from the computer science domain to develop an interactive concept map based navigation system that will retain the positive effects of concept maps, and also present the visuals in a way that does not cognitively overload the user.   This study seeks to answer the research question: “How can a large-scale concept map visualization tools be realized in a way that promotes conceptual understanding and manages cognitive load?” To answer the research question, a prototype tool, labeled the “Adaptive Map tool”, was developed and populated with engineering statics content. This prototype contains content that is similar to the material in a traditional statics textbook, but the information is accessed through the proposed adaptive concept map visualization. The tool was then given to students in engineering statics class to be used as a supplemental textbook. The effects of the Adaptive Map tool were evaluated through a multiple case study approach that allowed researchers to understand how this tool fit into the larger learning context of a class. Results indicated that some students did integrate the Adaptive Map tool into the learning process, and furthermore that the tool did promote meaningful learning behaviors that lead to better conceptual understanding of the material.

T1  - Cognitive Structural Change and the Technological Design Process
AN  - 1512645434
AB  - With increasing challenges from international competition and domestic demands for a technologically literate workforce, pressure is growing on the educational system to produce students that are literate in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Integrative STEM education utilizes design-based pedagogical approaches to teach science/math content and practices concurrently with technology/engineering content and practices (Wells & Ernst, 2012, para. 2). The discipline of technology education has traditionally implemented design-based pedagogical approaches. However, the discipline has not demonstrated through empirical research that its existence and pedagogies are beneficial to student learning and cognition (Lewis, 1999, 2006; Petrina, 1998; Wells, 2008, 2010; Zuga, 1994, 1997, 2001).    The purpose of this study was to demonstrate that the technological design-based approach to teaching biotechnology literacy supports students' connections of science and technology concepts. Grounded in Ausubel's (1968) theory on meaningful learning and Novak's (1980) advanced organizer of concept mapping, this study examined evidence of high school students' cognitive structural change throughout the technological design-based approach to instruction. At three key intervals throughout the technological design process, students developed concept maps to document their understanding of the biology and technology concepts presented within the instructional materials. Data for this study included the students' constructed concept maps. To analyze the concept maps, the researcher used Hay et al.'s (2008) three-method analysis for measuring the quality of students' learning, and a qualitative analysis.    Data analysis across all four methods indicated that all participants experienced a varying degree of growth in biology, technology, and integrative concepts and connections. Collectively this study supports the notion that the technological design-based approach to instruction does indeed (1) encourage meaningful learning, and (2) increase students' use of higher order thinking indicated by their abilities to demonstrate their use of schematic and strategic knowledge within their concept maps. The results of this study have direct implications within the areas of Technology Education, Science Education, classroom practice, and concept mapping. The discussion and implications suggest the need to expand the research conducted within this study, and to improve the methods for concept mapping analysis.

T1  - Exploring knowledge visualization, tools, and process in virtual team collaborative problem-solving
AN  - 1508835924
AB  - This multicase study followed three multidisciplinary virtual teams of Information Technology (IT) graduate students as they used concept maps to visualize the problem definition for a case to create a preliminary due diligence integration framework for acquisitions of new healthcare companies. Over four weeks, teams utilized online collaboration tools to meet, communicate, and create a concept map that defined the problem from the perspective of five different IT disciplines. The research focused on how the teams used processes and tools to collaborate in a virtual environment to visualize knowledge to define a problem in preparation for designing a solution.     Four themes framed the results: (a) knowledge; (b) tools; (c) interpersonal interactions; and (d) coordination. The literature on knowledge creation, social learning, problem-solving, knowledge visualization, and multimedia learning provided explanations to unite the themes. The data suggested that theories used to explain learning by individuals could be used to explain team problem-solving and knowledge creation. The data also suggested that interpersonal interactions and tools support team knowledge visualization. In particular, data suggested that use of instant messaging improved team performance due to improved flow, skill/task balance. This is contrary to prior research that categorized instant messaging as an interruption and similar to prior research that showed instant messaging influenced flow.

T1  - Capturing the semantics of evolving software ecosystem architectures
AN  - 1504831271
AB  - Current software modeling techniques emphasize the modeling of individual software systems using formal modeling tools, such as the Unified Modeling Language. With recent advances in the conceptualization of software ecosystems, the need for modeling techniques capable of describing the interaction between diverse software systems within the environment in which they are created and used has become apparent. This dissertation presents a semantic framework for the modeling of software ecosystems, including a concept-map based notation. Concretely, this modeling framework comprises a semantic web ontology with three classes and two properties. As validated by application to three app-centric software ecosystem case studies, this modeling framework is uniquely suited to describe software ecosystems. This suitability stems from the mechanisms provided by the semantic model for integrating the diverse elements of a software ecosystem and for spanning multiple levels of abstraction and decomposition. Additionally, the semantic modeling framework proposed here exposes evolving software ecosystems to graph analysis by representing their architecture in the form of a directed graph.   Keywords: Software Ecosystems, Software Modeling, Software Architecture, Semantic Modeling

T1  - How Does Student Understanding of a Concept Change Throughout a Unit of Instruction? Support Toward the Theory of Learning Progressions
AN  - 1498474270
AB  - This study documented the changes in understanding a class of eighth grade high school-level biology students experienced through a biology unit introducing genetics. Learning profiles for 55 students were created using concept maps and interviews as qualitative and quantitative instruments. The study provides additional support to the theory of learning progressions called for by experts in the field. The students' learning profiles were assessed to determine the alignment with a researcher-developed learning profile. The researcher-developed learning profile incorporated the learning progressions published in the Next Generation Science Standards, as well as current research in  learning progressions for 5-10th grade students studying genetics. Students were found to obtain understanding of the content in a manner that was nonlinear, even circuitous. This opposes the prevailing interpretation of learning progressions, that knowledge is ascertained in escalating levels of complexity. Learning progressions have implications in teaching sequence, assessment, education research, and policy. Tracking student understanding of other populations of students would augment the body of research and enhance generalizability.

T1  - The effects of student-led and teacher-led advance organizers on students' achievement and motivation of high school biology students
AN  - 1496775296
AB  - The purpose of this research study was to explore what effects student-led and teacher-led advance organizer's instruction had on students' achievement and motivation in a high school biology class.  The study used three advance organizers - Venn diagrams, concept maps, and KWL charts.     There was a total of 83 students who participated in this study, and were enrolled in four sections of high school biology.  The students were divided into two groups using systematic matching and received different advance organizer's instruction.  Two groups received student-led instruction using cooperative learning, whereas, the other two groups received teacher-led instruction.  Each group received a pretest, Advance Organizer Motivation Survey, weekly advance organizer-based lessons and weekly advance organizer evaluations for six weeks, posttest, and Advance Organizer Motivation Survey.     Pretest and posttest scores on the biology exam, weekly objective quizzes, and presurvey and postsurvey scores on the Advance Organizer Motivation Survey were collected.  Statistical analyses found no overall statistically significant difference in achievement between groups.  When looking at achievement results for redundant organizers it was found that the student-led group had a higher mean than the teacher-led group when working with concept maps. Furthermore, there was a statistically significant difference in students' motivation to learn and motivation to participate in student-led activities between groups. The student-led group reported higher motivation than the teacher-led group.  In regard to motivation and kinds of advance organizers, Venn diagrams and concept maps showed a statistically significant difference between groups, with the student-led group possessing more motivated with those two kinds of advance organizers than the teacher-led group.     Qualitative data were also collected through weekly advance organizer evaluations, Advance Organizer Motivation Survey, and focus groups.  These data revealed that the student-led group was more motivated to participate in the activity than the teacher-led group and that the student-led group preferred using Venn diagrams while the teacher-led group preferred using KWL charts.

T1  - The evaluation of teaching the nursing process using traditional lecture, campus laboratory, clinical, and the addition of high fidelity human simulation (hfhs) unfolding scenarios
AN  - 1496767050
AB  - It is not sufficient to just make changes in a nursing curriculum without a plan to evaluate the impact on program outcomes. This study sought to determine the outcomes of teaching the nursing process to Foundation of Nursing students in an Associate Degree Nursing program using a factorial design study. Four groups of students were taught the nursing process as follows: case study and concept mapping; case study, concept mapping with a pocket reference; case study, two hours HFHS, concept mapping with a pocket reference, or four hours of HFHS, concept mapping with a pocket reference.  The Simulation Design Scale (SDS) measured the perceptions of the simulation groups for design elements. The four hour group mean was significantly lower on both the importance of the objectives and information and importance of fidelity design elements (p < .05). This suggests that as time in a simulation increases more attention to these elements is required.  There was not a significant difference between the four study groups on the Nursing Process or the Assessment Technology Institute (ATI) RN Fundamentals 2010 Assessment Form B examinations individual scores. Two sub-categories on the ATI were significant. Planning was significantly higher for fall 2012 cohort (p = .024) and analysis/diagnosis was almost significant for fall 2011 cohort (p = .054). The results for Factorial Groups was not significant.  The National League for Nursing (NLN) PAX-RN entrance examination had a significant correlation with students passing onto the second semester in a nursing program (p < .001).  The ATI results of students were the same without regard to the Factorial Group assigned in relation to instructor employment status of full time versus part time.

T1  - Assessing conceptual knowledge for the physics of semiconductors
AN  - 1460765401
AB  - Following the trend in science and engineering education generated by the visible impact created by the Force Concept Inventory (FCI), the investigator developed a Physics of Semiconductors Concept Inventory (PSCI).  PSCI fills the need of standardized concept tests for undergraduate education in photonics and electrical engineering.      The structure of the PSCI test followed a concept map reflecting the input from a panel of experts from different universities and from a survey of textbooks currently used in engineering schools in the United States. Based on the statistical analysis of the scores and response patterns, the test was calibrated as an instrument to measure participants' cognitive ability independent of items' difficulty. The models employed were the Rasch Model and the Rasch Partial Credit Model. The estimation procedure employed was Conditional Maximum Likelihood. The analysis was carried on using algorithms written in the open-source language R.     The current PSCI BETA test contains eighteen calibrated items covering six concepts of the physics of semiconductors. PSCI BETA may be used for three purposes: individual student diagnostic if applied at the beginning of a physics of semiconductors course; predictor for students' academic performance in the field of semiconductors if applied at the end of instruction; assessment instrument for instructional strategies if applied both for pre- and post-instruction. The PSCI BETA instrument can be applied in any English speaking college setting.       The main results of the PSCI research are: ranking persons' ability related to the physics of semiconductors on an objective linear scale, building a diagnose matrix that may be utilized by instructors for choosing an optimal teaching approach and by students for remediation, and demonstrating a calibration method for small sample size.

T1  - A Concept Mapping Study of Gay/Straight Alliances
AN  - 1459748083
AB  - Research has shown the presence of a Gay/Straight Alliance (GSA) can have a positive effect on students' experiences in schools, yet there is a lack of research on the practices of GSAs. This study aimed to examine the ideal and actual practices of GSAs through the perceptions of a sample of GSA advisors (N=57) by utilizing concept mapping. Two concept mapping projects were conducted to identify and examine (1) the ideal practices of GSAs and (2) the obstacles experienced by these student-led clubs. Importance and frequency ratings were gathered for the ideal practices and the obstacles were rated on frequency and severity. Two six-cluster concept maps were generated to illustrate the ideal practices and obstacles experienced by GSAs. The concept of alignment from the GoodWork Project was then applied to the resultant relationships between ideal practices, actual practices, and obstacles. The alignment of the sample was evaluated in regard to the entire sample's ability to conduct the ideal practices considered important and the similarity and differences of practices and obstacles between two groups of GSAs based on location. While a high degree of alignment was found within the sample and between groups based on location, obstacles were still identified that may be contributory factors to the prevention of total alignment among GSAs and within a GSA's ability to conduct its ideal practices. Implications on GSA practices and educations and the limitations of this study are discussed.

T1  - School counselor-parent collaborations: Parents' perceptions of how school counselors can meet their needs
AN  - 1448561138
AB  - The purpose of this study was to gain a fuller understanding of the sort of assistance, support, or education parents feel they need from school counselors in parenting adolescents. The research question examined was: What sort of assistance, support, or education do independent school parents feel they need from school counselors in raising adolescent children? The participants for this study were parents of middle school children attending an independent school located in an urban southern city. All parents of children attending the independent school were asked to respond to an online “needs assessment” survey asking parents to select parent education topics that are of interest to them. Parents participating in this phase of the study had an opportunity to volunteer for the next phase of the study, an online card sort activity. Parents who volunteered for the online card sort activity were sent a link to the online card sort activity where they took a list of parent education topics and arranged them into groups as they saw fit. Analysis of the results revealed nine themes, or categories of topics that are of interest to parents of middle school children: Parenting Skills, Adolescent Self-Management, Self-Awareness and Esteem, Academic Opportunities and Career Choices, Peer Relationships and Skills, Emotional Wellness, Physical Health and Wellness, Parent-Teacher/Staff Communication, and Technology Safety and Use. An informal concept map was created to visually represent the categories of parent education topics that emerged from the study. The results of this study can assist professional school counselors in designing parent education and consultation curriculum and interventions, and help ensure that school counselors better meet parents’ needs.

T1  - Exploring the Experience of Insight and New Knowledge Creation
AN  - 1443861456
AB  - Caring professionals are challenged by complex and unstructured situations. There is evidence that their use of a tacit-intuitive perspective in perplexing circumstances is increasing. A better understanding of insight phenomenology, commonly known as the "aha" moment of solution discovery and new knowledge creation, could help improve caring professionals' performance. Nonaka's dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation was used as the conceptual framework to guide this phenomenological study. Interviews were conducted with 8 experienced community case managers. A modified phenomenological hermeneutic model of data collection and analysis yielded the research findings, which are displayed in the Nature of Insight and New Knowledge Creation Education Framework, and identified several factors. The essence of the insight includes the importance of experience applied to tacit knowledge-intuitive processes. Caring professionals invest the time to listen actively and build trusting relationships through respectful compassionate commitment. They employ gestalt-systems thinking, mental models, metaphors, concept maps, strategic thinking, creative problem solving, and reflective processing to experience the insight moment of solution discovery and new knowledge creation. This new knowledge is shared collaboratively through informal and formal tacit knowledge educational workplace exchanges. Recommendations focus on the nature of insight and the value of tacit knowledge with intuitive application. The study contributes to positive social change by informing educational curricula of programs to improve caring professionals' workplace practices with clients in the successful application of the tacit-intuitive phenomenon.

T1  - Unequal treatment or uneven consequence: A content analysis of Americans with Disabilities Act Title I disparate impact cases from 1992–2012
AN  - 1443861344
AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the patterns and themes of litigation in Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) disability discrimination cases charged under the theory of disparate impact. Specifically, this study used Computer Assisted Legal Research (CALR) to identify and review all U.S. Appellate Court ADA disparate impact cases as reported by Westlaw, a commercial electronic case law reporting system owned by Thomson Reuters.      This study used a two-step, mixed methods approach to analyze the data relevant to the research questions and sub-questions. First, the researcher employed content analysis (Hall & Wright, 2008) to identify and characterize patterns and trends of litigation in all reported U.S. Appellate Court ADA cases charged under the theory of disparate impact from 1992 through 2012. Cases were analyzed chronologically, and variables included number of published and unpublished cases, distribution of jurisdiction, distribution of ADA titles, EEOC involvement, case fact patterns, and characteristics of charging and opposing parties. Frequency analyses were conducted on these data. Second, the researcher identified a subset of the ADA disparate impact cases analyzed in the first step: Title I, or employment discrimination cases. Qualitative analysis employing the constant comparative method (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) was used to identify and characterize patterns and themes of the judicial opinions in the Title I disparate impact cases. The researcher developed a framework for analysis based on a review of the literature of the sociopolitical perspective of disability to guide the analysis of the judicial opinions in the subset of disparate impact cases. The results of the frequency analyses conducted on these data revealed four trends: (a) Precedent, (b) Circuit and Judge Effects, (c) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Successes, and (d) Sutton Case Effect. The results of the qualitative analysis of the text of the judicial opinions produced four themes and three relationships among the themes. The four themes were accommodation(s); workplace culture, norms, and policies; judicial process; and policy space. The three relationships were gap-filling, weighing and balancing, and maintaining status quo versus effecting social change. The themes and relationships are depicted in a concept map that visually displays the conceptual framework revealed in the study.      The findings in this study may inform disability and rehabilitation scholars about ADA disparate impact cases, a body of law about which little is known. The patterns and trends identified in ADA Title I disparate impact cases may provide information about the types of policies and practices that are most frequently litigated. Rehabilitation practitioners may be able to use the results of this research to develop education and outreach strategies for employers on best practices for hiring, accommodating, and promoting employees with disabilities. Because the workplace policies and procedures identified in the cases that comprise this study are neutral on their face rather than intentionally discriminatory, employers may benefit from information that assists them in evaluating their policies and procedures proactively, which may avoid costly and time-consuming litigation. Finally, workplace policies and procedures that fairly represent the essential functions of the job and are applied uniformly to workers with and without disabilities will contribute to a more diverse workforce.

T1  - Changing Student Learning Approaches in Fundamental Accounting Education Through the Use of Graphic Organizers
AN  - 1442193427
AB  - The field of accounting has experienced dramatic changes in the past 20 years. Advances in technology and workplace requirements have changed the responsibilities in the accounting position of a historical recorder to a functioning manager within the organization. The curriculum used by accounting instructors has not changed or kept pace with redefinition of accounting competency. This study was designed to measure the effectiveness of graphical organizers in teaching accounting. Assessment was based on a deep versus surface approach checklist which was altered to reflect accounting terminology. Means testing was the primary comparison protocol. Two classes were selected in an Oregon community college which were instructed by the same instructor. One class used graphic organizers as a communication tool, and the other class did not. Results did not indicate or favor one method over the other. Other learning factors contributed to the lack of significance in this study.

T1  - The Effect of Concept Mapping on Student Understanding and Correlation with Student Learning Styles
AN  - 1440484448
AB  - This study investigated the use of concept mapping as a pedagogical strategy to promote change in the learning styles of pre-nursing students. Students' individual learning styles revealed two subsets of students; those who demonstrated a learning style that favors abstract conceptualization and those who demonstrated a learning style that favors concrete experience. Students in the experimental groups performed concept mapping activities designed to facilitate an integrative understanding of interactions between various organ systems of the body while the control group received a traditional didactic instruction without performing concept mapping activities. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected in order to measure differences in student achievement. Analysis of the quantitative data revealed no significant change in the learning styles of students in either the control or experimental groups. Learning style groups were analyzed qualitatively for recurring or emergent themes that students identified as facilitating their learning. An analysis of qualitative data revealed that most students in the pre-nursing program were able to identify concepts within the class based upon visual cues, and a majority of these students exhibited the learning style of abstract conceptualization. As the laboratory experience for the course involves an examination of the anatomical structures of the human body, a visual identification of these structures seemed to be the most logical method to measure students' ability to identify anatomical structures.

T1  - Relational and item specific processes in retrieval practice
AN  - 1433828526
AB  - Retrieving information is a key process for understanding learning and identifying the best practices in the classroom, yet little is known about roles of retrieving relational and item-specific information. Despite a wealth of knowledge regarding relational and item-specific processes during encoding, it is relatively unknown how retrieval of these components affects learning. The primary goal of this experiment was to examine the effects of retrieval of relational and item-specific components of educationally relevant texts using concept mapping. The secondary goal of this paper was to examine learning with multiple final assessments. The final goal was exploratory in nature and was aimed at understanding whether reading comprehension affected students' ability to learn from retrieval. In the current experiment, students studied a science text and engaged in retrieval-based concept mapping for three alternating periods (study, retrieval, study, retrieval, study, retrieval). During retrieval, students were given a partially completed concept map. Students either retrieved the items, relations, or both. Others completed a distractor task that did not involve concept mapping. One week later students took a final concept map recall, free recall and order reconstruction test.      During the initial learning session, low comprehension scores predicted low initial performance, but only on period 1; comprehension scores did not predict performance on the remaining learning periods.      After a week delay, students in all three retrieval practice conditions outperformed those in the study-only control, the standard retrieval practice effect. Only small differences among these conditions were found on any final assessment, but covariate adjusted means with initial recall level as a covariate showed a benefit for retrieving both. Low comprehension students performed worse on the final concept map recall and free recall test, but no differential benefits of retrieval practice was found between high and low comprehension students. Additional studies are needed to further explore individual differences and retrieval practice. Collectively, results indicate that retrieving a combination of item specific information and relational information is beneficial.

T1  - Effective use of multimedia presentations to maximize learning within high school science classrooms
AN  - 1431912397
AB  - This research used an evidenced-based experimental 2 x 2 factorial design General Linear Model with Repeated Measures Analysis of Covariance (RMANCOVA). For this analysis, time served as the within-subjects factor while treatment group (i.e., static and signaling, dynamic and signaling, static without signaling, and dynamic without signaling) served as the between-subject independent variable. Three dependent variables were used to assess learner outcomes: (a) a 14 multiple-choice pre and post-test to measure knowledge retention, (b) a pre and post-test concept map to measure synthesis and structure of knowledge, and (c) four questions based on a Likert scale asking students to rank the cognitive difficulty of understanding four aspects of the animation they engaged in. A mental rotations test was used in the pretest conditions to establish a control and used as a covariate.    The treatment contained a four minute and 53 second animation that served as an introductory multimedia presentation explaining the gravitational effects of the moon and sun on the earth. These interactions occur at predictable times and are responsible for creating the tidal effects experienced on Earth. There were 99 volunteer high school participants enrolled in science classes randomly assigned to one of four treatment conditions. The research was conducted to determine how motion and the principle of signaling, established in The Cognitive Theory of Multimedia Learning affected precollege learners. The experiment controlled for modality, segmenting, temporal contiguity, redundancy, and navigational control. Results of the RMANCOVA indicated statistical significance for the within subjects effect: over time for all participants, with time and knowledge retention measured from the multiple-choice results, and in the category quality of concepts represented in the concept map analysis. However, there were no significant differences in the between groups analysis for knowledge retention based on the multiple-choice assessment, or among groups over time in the concept map variables number of concepts, levels, and quality of concepts. Additionally, when measuring cognitive difficulty when learning from the animations, no significant differences were measured.

T1  - What are the Effects of Implementing Learning-Focused Strategies in Biology and Physical Science Classrooms?
AN  - 1427936447
AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if Learning-Focused Strategies (LFS) implemented in high school science courses would affect student achievement and the pass rate of biology and physical science Common District Assessments (CDAs). The LFS, specific teaching strategies contained in the Learning-Focused Strategies Model (LFSM) Program were researched in this study. The LFSM Program provided a framework for comprehensive school improvement to those schools that implemented the program. The LFSM Program provided schools with consistent training in the utilization of exemplary practices and instruction. A high school located in the suburbs of Atlanta, Georgia was the focus of this investigation. Twelve high school science classrooms participated in the study: six biology and six physical science classes. Up-to-date research discovered that the strategies contained in the LFSM Program were research-based and highly effective for elementary and middle school instruction. Research on its effectiveness in high school instruction was the main focus of this study. This investigation utilized a mixed methods approach, in which data were examined qualitatively and quantitatively. Common District Assessment (CDA) quantitative data were collected and compared between those science classrooms that utilized LFS and those using traditional instructional strategies. Qualitative data were generated through classroom observations, student surveys, and teacher interviews. Individual data points were triangulated to determine trends of information reflecting the effects of implementing LFS. Based on the data collected in the research study, classrooms utilizing LFS were more successful academically than the classrooms using traditional instructional methods. Derived from the quantitative data, students in LFS classrooms were more proficient on both the biology and physical science Unit 1 CDAs, illustrating the effectiveness of LFS in the science classroom.   Key terms: Cognitive teaching strategies, College readiness, Common District Assessments (CDAs), Concept maps, Constructivism, Curriculum, Differentiated Instruction, Instruction, Formative assessments, Learning-Focused Strategies (LFS), Learning-Focused Strategies Model (LFSM), No Child Left Behind (NCLB), Post-secondary institution, Remediation courses, School improvement grant, School reform, Secondary institution, Traditional instructional strategies.

T1  - Understanding environmental sustainability as a complex system: Use of an agent-based participatory watershed simulation
AN  - 1419434290
AB  - Understanding the functions and properties of complex systems is necessary for participants pursuing education and careers in the areas of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) because the fundamental constructs of complex systems apply across many domains and are at the heart of the solutions to many global issues facing the world today (National Science Foundation, 2009). Complex systems understanding has been a persistently difficult set of concepts for participants to learn and the science community, despite years of effort, has been unsuccessful in achieving complex systems understanding at the undergraduate level. There is a need for new technologies to be developed to help improve the way complex systems understanding happens and evidence that agent-based simulations can be an effective learning tool in this context. The purpose of this study was to examine complex systems understanding with the use of an agent-based simulation called the UVA Bay Game. Using a mixed methods, cross-case analysis, this exploratory study examined how undergraduate participants in three separate courses experienced changes in complex systems understanding with the use of the UVA Bay Game through the development of concept maps and written reflections on their learning. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre and post-simulation concept maps, this study supported an overall positive increase of complex systems understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Understanding how participants experience an increase in complex systems understanding with the use of a particular agent-based simulation will help us better understand how learning happens in this context and how we best design simulations to maximize participant learning outcomes.

T1  - A design-based approach to teaching sustainability
AN  - 1399161413
AB  - We live on a finite ecological system, yet consume as though resources are unlimited. Current environmental data suggests many in the developed world are living beyond what the earth is able to sustain. The paradigms in which we operate continue to support a path of constant consumption that continues to exacerbate this problem. Technology educators can and should play a valuable role in working with students to question these paradigms through lessons that begin to engage students toward thinking about a more sustainable future.    Design-based instruction provides a framework for instructional practices that allows students to build problem-solving and critical thinking skills as they begin to understand deeper concepts related to sustainability. This study examined middle school students' understanding of sustainability after completing a design based unit. The study evaluated student work, concept maps, observations and pre-and post-tests to determine student understanding of sustainability. Instruction involved aspects of problem-based learning, design education and the use of technology.     Students were given an authentic problem of designing a sustainable home. As part of the design process, students conducted research on the factors and specific design components that would make a home sustainable. The main question guiding this study was "How can a home design project impact middle school students' understanding and appreciation of sustainability?"    The findings suggest students demonstrated significant growth in understanding concepts of sustainability and were able to apply sustainable concepts in their designs. Eighty percent of students were able to meet or exceed rubric expectations on explaining the importance of sustainability. All of the students also demonstrated considerable growth in the understanding and application of sustainable solutions to their designs. They were able to propose authentic solutions to the problem and apply their research.

T1  - A Descriptive Study of Pre-Service Science Teachers' Conceptual Understanding of Scientific Inquiry using Concept Maps
AN  - 1357123621
AB  - Future science teachers serve a critical role in creating a scientifically literate citizenry. Their knowledge and understanding of the process by which science works, scientific inquiry, is fundamental to this goal of science education. This descriptive research study investigated pre-service secondary science teachers' conceptual understanding of scientific inquiry using concept maps. Thirty participants constructed concept maps describing the interrelationships among twelve scientific inquiry concepts.  The concept maps were analyzed to determine how participants structured, organized, associated, and described the relationships between these concepts. The majority of participants did organize and associate a chain of inquiry concepts with one another into a scientific method series. Participants displayed an overall low number of associations between the twelve inquiry concepts. Of the concept pairs that were associated with one another, there was a lack of consistency in the linking words used to describe the relationship between them. Implications for science educators in the development and design of teaching about inquiry in pre-service teacher education programs and professional development opportunities are examined. Recommendations for further study into the conceptual understanding of beginning science teachers are also discussed.

T1  - Fostering 'Virtual Communities of Practice' to Move Cancer Control Research into Practice
AN  - 1346182114
AB  - This dissertation utilizes community of practice theory to explore how create and sustain federally-sponsored virtual communities of practice (VCoP) that focus on translating cancer control research into practice. The federal government has the responsibility to translate findings from research it funds into real-world practice. With increasing budget cuts, travel restrictions and limitations on attendance at meetings and conferences, federal agencies, including the National Cancer Institute, have identified VCoP as a mechanism for engaging with important constituencies such as researchers and practitioners to facilitate this translation. However, creating and sustaining VCoP is a new endeavor for most federal agencies.     This study utilized concept mapping, an integrated mixed-methods approach, to examine the issues key stakeholder believe need to be addressed to create and sustain government-sponsored VCoP to integrate cancer control research, practice and policy. Approximately 1,500 researchers, practitioners, and intermediaries were invited to participate in the concept mapping study. The study found nine key areas that are important to the creation of federally-sponsored VCoP: 1) standardization/best practices; 2) funding/resources; 3) external validity; 4) preparing the environment; 5) social learning & collaboration; 6) cooperation; 7) social determinants/cultural competency; 8) partnerships; and, 9) inclusiveness. Wenger's Community of Practice Framework is modified based on results from the concept mapping study to reflect the specific topics relevant for a federally-sponsored virtual community of practice designed to translate cancer control research into practice.     Based on the concept maps generated for the overall group (N=39), researchers, practitioners and intermediaries were in relative agreement regarding issues of importance for creating a VCoP designed to move cancer control research into practice. Based on the ladder graphs, the three groups were found to have a correlation regarding the relative importance ranging from r=0.43 to r=0.81. Actively engaging these groups in creating and sustaining a VCoP may require different approaches. Researchers are most likely be engaged in a VCoP when there are opportunities to develop partnerships through the community. Intermediaries are most likely to be involved in a VCoP when the VCoP is framed as a mechanism for collaboration and partnership that links research with practice.  Practitioners are most likely to participate when the focus of the VCoP helps them understand how to utilize evidence-based approaches in practice and when the VCoP focuses on patient and community needs. The findings also highlight the important role of trust in creating a VCoP.    The National Cancer Institute, and other federal agencies that are currently exploring the use of VCoP, can use the findings from this study to actively engage researchers and practitioners, and intermediaries in the development and implementation of VCoP designed to move research into practice.

T1  - Enacting Occupation and Identity: Perspectives of Children and Their Parents
AN  - 2700375895
AB  - Children with disabilities are at risk for limited opportunities to engage in childhood occupations. Occupation is defined broadly as everything people need, want, or are obliged to do, and as understanding how social dimensions shape occupations and opportunities for participation. Emergent literature suggests that identities are shaped by what we do. This research examines how occupation is implicated in the shaping of identities for school-aged children with physical disabilities in light of the socio-cultural dimensions that shape opportunities for children to participate in childhood occupations.  This work is comprised of five integrated manuscripts, in addition to introduction, methodology, and discussion chapters. The first manuscript contributes to disciplinary discussions about occupational identity as an emerging construct and calls for a socio-cultural theoretical perspective to considerations of occupational identity. The second manuscript examines a disability studies perspective, and introduces the concept of reflexivity as important for professional practice in occupational therapy. The third manuscript discusses photoelicitation as a promising method for eliciting children’s perspectives in research. In addition philosophical underpinnings, practical considerations, ethical considerations, and examples from this research are discussed. The fourth manuscript reports on the empirical work, examining how occupation is implicated in the shaping of identity for children with physical disabilities. In depth case studies were used to investigate participation in occupations and perceptions of identity with six children and their parents. Each case was analyzed using concept maps and coded for conceptual categories. Six categories are presented: Perceptions of Self and Other: Living with Disability; Family Identity, Tradition and Culture; Relational Identity: A Sense of Belonging; Pride, Success, and Seeing things through…; Growing up and Keeping Up; and Identity as Dynamic. Finally, the fifth manuscript revisits the topic of reflexivity, and discusses its merit in ethical research with children.  This thesis contributes to knowledge pertaining to socio-cultural factors that shape opportunities for children to participate in occupations, and the relationship between occupation and identity for children with physical disabilities. In addition this work contributes to methodological and ethical discussions about conducting research with children. This work has implications for occupational science, health care professionals, policy, children and parents.

T1  - Focus Question Effect on Dynamic Thinking in a Concept Map
AN  - 2675221921
AB  - A concept map is an educational tool designed to help identify, represent, and categorize relationships between different ideas relating to an overall concept. Relationships or transitions between the ideas are created by students and can either be static or dynamic. Static transitions help to describe, define, and organize knowledge for a given domain. Dynamic transitions show how a change in quantity, quality, or state in one concept causes change in quantity, quality, or state in the other concept. The focus question of the map directs student input of the concepts and ultimately determines what types of transitions are used.The study by Derbentseva et al. (2006) provides a framework for how to influence students to utilize dynamic thinking in a concept map by directing the focus question toward more analysis of a subject rather than simple description. By changing the wording of the focus question, this study examined the difference in the amount of dynamic transitions used by students to break down a concept. The study was run on two different populations in order to find a trend between the wording of the focus question and the number of dynamic transitions used. Gender, academic level, and methodology were also evaluated and shown to have no effect on the dynamic transitions in a concept map. Overall, when students were asked to answer a “How does…work?” question, they used more dynamic than static transitions to break down a concept. When students were simply presented with a “What is…?” question, their overall thinking proved to be more static in nature. An increase in dynamic thinking means a shift from a recall level of thinking towards a more conceptual level of thinking, which should lead to an increase in student academic gains.

T1  - Assessing Effectiveness of Concept Map as Instructional Tool in High School Biology
AN  - 2674873668
AB  - This thesis emphasizes on an alternate instructional tool called “Concept Map”. The goal of this study was to determine the effectiveness of using concept maps in improving the science achievement of 10th -grade students and compare it with a traditional approach for a Biology unit. Furthermore, the interaction of the student’s concept mapping ability and their learning gains was investigated. Both the control and the experimental groups were required to take a pre test before instruction and a posttest at the end of three weeks. The test consisting of 31 questions was used to assess learning gains on a Biology Unit about Balance in Nature. Student-constructed maps were scored using Novak’s scoring scheme. The first finding of the study was that concept map – exposed students did not perform much better than the same level students in the traditional group. The difference in the learning gains between the experimental and the control group in their unit test, though statistically significant, did not seem to be solely due to concept mapping. The second finding indicated that total scores in concept maps did not strongly predict student achievement in Science. Moreover, results showed that the levels of concept mapping ability were not associated with the concept- mapping students’ learning gains. Nevertheless, the study suggests that, when carefully integrated into the normal classroom procedure and when other contributing factors such as student motivation and preparedness, reading ability levels, time and classroom environment are considered, concept mapping has a potential to be an effective instructional strategy.

T1  - Advances in Learning Theory and Instructional Development: Implications for Physiology Teaching
AN  - 2528180519
AB  - South Africa, as a developing country, is in search of an approach to education that could overhaul the problems associated with the historical education system. Outcomes-based education was introduced in South Africa on the assumption that it would lead to an increase in the quality of education by improving the standard of teaching and learning performance and by providing a curriculum that is more relevant to learners‘ needs. A focus of this research project is to empower physiology lecturers with the relevant teaching, learning and assessment skills needed to implement outcomes-based education within a constructivist framework.This research study describes the development of learning interventions for physiology that exploits the congruencies between constructivist perspectives on learning and the individual attributes of students as defined by learning styles and instructional design principles.This development research project was conducted in four phases: an extensive literature review in which teaching, learning and assessment models and theories were integrated into Curry‘s 'Onion model‘; the design of questionnaires, based on the literature reviewed, to compile a profile of the students registered for physiology at the University of Johannesburg; a pilot study; implementation of the questionnaires; and analysis of the data. Concurrent with this the different teaching, learning and assessment interventions, as identified in the literature, were implemented and evaluated continuously. A questionnaire was designed and implemented to determine student‘s views on these different interventions. Observations were also captured in a teaching diary and during semi-structured interviews with students.The literature review revealed that although there is a vast amount of information available on teaching, learning and assessment most of the models, theories and strategies described do not address the presence of more than one style at a time. This study makes a contribution to the field of instructional design for physiology with the development and application of the proposed model for 'Whole brain learning‘, as well as the proposed model for designing learning interventions entitled 'The 3‘D‘s of designing learning interventions‘.

T1  - Continuities and Discontinuities in Factors Contributing to Science Achievement
AN  - 2458760649
AB  - The discipline of chemistry remains a challenge for many college students interested in pursuing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematic (STEM) disciplines and related professions, particularly underrepresented minority (URM) students. Higher numbers of URM students are entering college with aspirations of pursuing science disciplines now than any time in the past decade. However, the disparity between URM students interested in pursuing science and URM students' matriculation rates is considerable. This is especially important in high-stakes "gatekeeper" courses such as introductory organic chemistry because this course is a requirement for a majority of science degrees and has led students, especially minority students, to question their ability to succeed in science.This dissertation examines two competing perspectives – continuities and discontinuities in learning – that have been used to explain students' differential academic achievement. More specifically, these perspectives are examined with respect to important factors like problem solving, conceptual understanding, and study activity behaviors that are related with students' course performance. To date, no study has examined both perspectives simultaneously with respect to important cognitive and behavioral factors.A total of 90 first-semester organic chemistry students attending Golden Gate State University (pseudonym) were recruited for this study. Students were required to attend a total of 4 semi-structured interviews that covered key units throughout the semester. Each interview consisted of completing a concept mapping exercise, a problem set while thinking out loud, and a week-long daily study diary.Concept map proposition scores and problem set scores revealed a main effect of ethnicity that was associated with prior science GPA. In contrast, neither concept map structure nor study strategy was related to a student's ethnic group affiliation. In solving problems, students predominately used 4 common strategies (Forward-working, Means-end, Trial-and-error, and Guessing) to solve problems. Differences were associated with students' prior achievement level (High or Low). Finally, investigation of study strategies showed that all students, regardless of ethnicity, predominantly engage in 4 commonly used study strategies.Results overwhelmingly support the continuity perspective indicating that students' performance on key outcomes are attributable to prior learning, not ethnic group affiliation. These findings underscore the importance of providing access to quality science learning opportunities and resources that aid in developing students understanding. In addition, the finding that students' predominately use reviewing strategies in isolation when studying for organic chemistry highlight the importance of developing workshops and tutorials that encourage students to engage in active peer-learning strategies such as seeking help from peers or goal setting activities.Findings from this study are expected to lead to the design of randomized trial studies involving individualized versus group study strategies and performance on conceptual understanding and problem solving measures. Ultimately, the goal of this line of research is to inform the restructuring of organic chemistry teaching and learning methods in order to close potential gaps in student knowledge. Furthermore, the information obtained from these analyses is expected to be of importance to the prevention of student attrition in STEM courses and the encouragement of enrollment of underrepresented groups.

T1  - Examining the effects of laboratory instruction on high school chemistry students' conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium
AN  - 1817944941
AB  - At high school level, students are expected to predict the behavior of the chemical systems at equilibrium. Numerous research studies have evidenced that high school chemistry students presented difficulties with the topic of chemical equilibrium. Likewise, several studies have suggested that laboratory instruction may benefit students by providing concrete situations and practical experiences. Therefore, I investigated how the laboratory instruction about chemical equilibrium might help high school chemistry students to construct and apply meaningful mental models of macroscopic, molecular, and symbolic representational levels and understand this topic. In this study, high school student-constructed concept maps (n= 9) that emerged from pre- & post- laboratory instructional interviews about chemical equilibrium were scored against a teacher map using a rubric. I used these student-constructed concept maps in conjunction with the interviews as way to provide a 2D-representation of: (1) the students' knowledge about chemical equilibrium and (2) the students' use of the three representational levels. A scoring rubric was developed to: (1) holistic analyze the concept map configuration, (2) numeric analyze the accuracy of the links, and (3) classify the links on the map based on three representational levels. Inter-rater reliability for the scoring scheme was high (r= 0.82). Students-constructed concept maps and interviews proved to be helpful tools to assess students' understanding of chemical equilibrium and students' use of the three representational levels. The data analysis of the assessment instruments was performed using Dedoose ® (an online Web 2.0 software) were emerging trends from the analysis can be observed in a code cloud and bar graphs instantaneously. Results obtained using the quality of understanding scheme (used to score the interviews) and the link accuracy rubric (used to score the concept maps) revealed that after the instruction the students showed partial understanding of the relation between the concepts related to chemical equilibrium. The levels of representations that students utilized to describe their understanding of chemical equilibrium were also classified. After the instruction, the students favored symbolic and macroscopic/symbolic levels of representation to describe chemical equilibrium.

T1  - Students' representations and experiences of personal development and pdp at one british university
AN  - 1779233516
AB  - Those who teach in Higher Education in the UK face with the growing internationalisation and diverse landscape of the sector as well as an obligation to provide students with opportunities for personal, professional and academic development. Whilst a great deal has been written about both internationalisation and Personal Development Planning (PDP), a structured and supported process, which is intended to enable individual students to reflect upon their learning and plan for their future (QM, 2000), relatively little is known about international students' perceptions and experiences of such development and planning. This thesis aims to explore issues that are under-represented in the literature, experiences, perceptions and meanings of personal development and PDP among international students, and cast some light· on the complexities of individuals' development and growth. It employs a broadly phenomenological perspective, attending to individual representations and understandings of a small group of culturally diverse students in one university setting, captured with the use of qualitative research methods (concept maps and interviews). Methodologically, it attends to the researcher's specific insider/outsider positioning and highlights reflexivity as the key feature of the research process. It documents the research journey in a transparent and conscious way, evidencing the methodological experimentation and the development of the researcher. This research raises key questions about uncritical application of concepts such as PDP as well as other pedagogic practices in increasingly diverse classrooms that are underpinned by Western philosophical and scholarly traditions. It challenges a narrow perspective of personal development as centred on agency, individuality, self-promotion, independence and personal achievement and gain by inviting a consideration of personal development and learning as socially constructed processes with a wider range of purposes than traditionally articulated by PDP. It also challenges the perception of international students as 'bearers of problems' and 'empty vessels' and contributes to the shift in the literature from the rhetoric of blame and deficiency to the rhetoric of resource - respectful of students' experiences and knowledge. Whilst not claiming generalisability from a small sample of participants, this project nonetheless has broader implications for researching and teaching across cultures, raising awareness of complexities of multicultural education. In this research I focus on students' ideas of personal development (PD) and personal development planning (PDP). By looking for things that support, not hinder their personal, professional, social and academic development I am able to offer some insights into students' conceptions, beliefs, experiences, hopes and aspirations and suggest ways of improving educational practice (especially in terms of PDP).

T1  - The effects of using concept mapping as an artifact to engender metacognitive thinking in first-year medical students' problem-based learning discussions: A mixed-methods investigation
AN  - 1627160937
AB  - Attention in medical education is turning toward instruction that not only focuses on knowledge acquisition, but on developing the medical students’ clinical problem-solving skills, and their ability to critically think through complex diseases. Metacognition is regarded as an important consideration in how we teach medical students these higher-order, critical thinking skills.    This study used a mixed-methods research design to investigate if concept mapping as an artifact may engender metacognitive thinking in the medical student population. Specifically the purpose of the study is twofold: (1) to determine if concept mapping, functioning as an artifact during problem-based learning, improves learning as measured by scores on test questions; and (2) to explore if the process of concept mapping alters the problem-based learning intragroup discussion in ways that show medical students are engaged in metacognitive thinking.   The results showed that students in the problem-based learning concept-mapping groups used more metacognitive thinking patterns than those in the problem-based learning discussion-only group, particularly in the monitoring component. These groups also engaged in a higher level of cognitive thinking associated with reasoning through mechanisms-of-action and breaking down complex biochemical and physiologic principals. The students disclosed in focus-group interviews that concept mapping was beneficial to help them understand how discrete pieces of information fit together in a bigger structure of knowledge. They also stated that concept mapping gave them some time to think through these concepts in a larger conceptual framework. There was no significant difference in the exam-question scores between the problem-based learning concept-mapping groups and the problem-based learning discussion-only group.

T1  - A study of semi-hierarchical organization in the construction of concept maps using the framework of cognitive load theory
AN  - 1514471937
AB  - The value of hierarchy as an essential trait of concept maps and a way to enhance recall is explored in this thesis. Undergraduate students ( N = 40) were randomly assigned to one of two groups and completed an 18-question multiple-choice pre-test about the concept of animal physiology. Then each group studied one of two visual organizers that varied in the level of hierarchy used and finally both groups completed the same multiple-choice test. This research was guided by the following two research questions: Do undergraduate science students using expert-created concept maps differ in their ability to enhance their recall of information about animal physiology when compared to students using visual organizers with limited hierarchy?  How does prior knowledge affect the recall of students using concept maps and other visual organizers with limited hierarchy?         The data collected from the two groups was analyzed using regression analyses, ANOVA, and repeated-measures ANOVA. It was found that the hierarchical concept-mapping group grew more in their recall of information about animal physiology than the visual-organizer group [F(1,38) = 7.70, p = .009]. The results of these analyses were interpreted using the conceptual framework of cognitive load theory. This theory deals with the encumbrance on working memory that subsequently affects how one recalls information. The findings support the contention that hierarchical concept maps confer an advantage in the recall of science concepts when compared to visual organizers with limited hierarchy. This study lays the ground work for a doctoral study with 200 participants separated into four experimental groups ( n = 50), with participants separated by high and low prior knowledge and the aforementioned visual organizers.

T1  - Kingston adolescents' knowledge about the social determinants of health: Assessing and addressing the gap
AN  - 1514007471
AB  - Upstream social determinants of health (SDH) have become widely acknowledged as lying at the root of poor health outcomes in Canada and globally. Conditions of social disadvantage restrict access to both social and physical resources, limiting the opportunity to actively pursue a healthy lifestyle. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health maintains that educating the public about the SDH is a key step towards population health equity. Educating adolescents may be the most efficient and effective route of SDH knowledge dissemination, as youth are in a stage of peak learning, and are also easily reached through health education curriculum delivered in secondary school. However, health curriculum in Ontario is lacking in SDH content, placing a much greater emphasis on individual, lifestyle behaviors, such as diet, physical activity, and sax sex practices. Identifying a gap in SDH knowledge within this population, and evaluating the benefits of SDH education, is required to advocate for health curriculum revision to include SDH material. This project is designed as both a research study and SDH educational intervention. Concept mapping exercises were used to determine students’ knowledge of the determinants of health and the SDH. The impact of short term SDH education on student retention of SDH material was also evaluated. Student concept maps indicated that students attributed their health primarily to physical determinants versus social determinants; 44% of maps contained no SDH content. Statistical analyses prior to delivering the SDH lessons indicated that students’ SDH knowledge varied by their relative socioeconomic status (SES). Post-lesson analyses indicated however that student SDH knowledge increased significantly, and final levels of SDH knowledge following the SDH lessons was unaffected by socio-demographic variables. Findings suggest that 1) there is an SDH knowledge gap in the adolescent population, 2) an inequity in adolescent SDH knowledge exists across socio-economic factors, and 3) that SDH education can potentially eliminate the inequity in SDH knowledge. Current Ontario health curriculum requires revision to include SDH material. Designing curricula to have an optimal influence on both student learning and adolescent health requires greater communication and collaboration from both educational institutions and health agencies in Canada

T1  - United States evaluation policy: A theoretical taxonomy
AN  - 1513556541
AB  - Efforts are currently underway in the US federal context to improve and strengthen evaluation practice and increase the use of evaluation results to inform policies and programs. However, these efforts remain unrealized, due partly to the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework that views evaluation and related organizational processes and institutions as part of a larger system. Early intuitive theoretical taxonomies of evaluation policy suffer from the lack of connection to specific examples and instances, and are missing clear classification criteria that would allow practical application. To generate a grounded taxonomy of evaluation policy, this study surveyed members of the American Evaluation Association in 2009, asking them to generate examples of evaluation policy, and then to sort and rate these suggested policies. Results are analyzed using the concept mapping method of Trochim (1989), which first translates aggregate sorting decisions into conceptual “distances” on a two-dimensional dot map, then uses hierarchical cluster analysis to generate groupings of ideas. These groupings become the foundation for categories in a theoretical taxonomy. Findings reveal several different dimensions by which participants grouped evaluation policies, including the dimensions of “value” and “policy mechanism.” A values-by-mechanisms taxonomy and instructions for its use in an evaluation policy inventory process are proposed.

T1  - Comparing the Effect of Reflections, Written Exercises, and Multimedia Instruction to Address Learners' Misconceptions using Structural Assessment of Knowledge
AN  - 1364640095
AB  - The study assessed the knowledge structure of Grade 11 physics students and their instructors using Pathfinder networks. Instructors’ structural knowledge was averaged to create a referent pathfinder network. Each student’s pathfinder network was compared with the referent pathfinder network in order to identify misconceptions. These misconceptions served as the basis for remedial instruction.   The study was conducted in six sections of Grade 11. Three different types of remedial instruction based on three different chapters from the Grade 11 physics textbook were given to the students at three separate stages. In the first section, students were shown their own and referent pathfinder networks as an intervention during the first stage. The students were asked to reflect on the similarities and differences between them. The researcher gave written concept-oriented exercises based on the differences at the second stage, and multimedia concept-oriented instruction based on the differences was given to the students at the third stage. The order of instruction was counterbalanced in all the six sections. After each stage, students’ pathfinder networks were reassessed and the similarities between students’ and the referent pathfinder networks were calculated to measure the effect of a particular intervention. The study tried to determine which type of remedial instruction given to students best improved the knowledge structure of the students in the domain of physics.   Results revealed that the similarity indices around the treatment concepts in the pathfinder networks of the students increased the most from pre- to post-intervention phase because of their reflections, followed by multimedia concept-oriented instruction and written concept-oriented exercises. Most likely, the major reason for this change was the interventions around the treatment concepts by the researcher at three different stages which stimulated and probably changed some of students’ misconceptions. To address the issue of validity, the similarity indices of control concepts in the students’ pathfinder networks were also checked for improvement. The result shows that there is no appreciable improvement in control concepts as there was no intervention around those concepts. Findings support the use of structural assessment of knowledge with pathfinder scaling technique to check the effectiveness of a classroom instruction.

T1  - A methodology for modeling healthcare teams and an evaluation of Business Process Modeling Notation as a Modeling Language
AN  - 1355737257
AB  - Whether it is offering services, delivering solutions or driving innovations, team work has been a hallmark of efficiency and effectiveness in various industries. The healthcare industry is not left out as its service delivery process involves numerous interfaces, information flows and patient hand-offs among professionals with different educational training, differing knowledge levels and possibly working from different locations as well.   As healthcare delivery evolves to being more patient-centered, so does the team settings as well, becoming more collaborative. Such changes also translate into a need for support systems to evolve to be able to provide support for the extent of collaboration that would be needed. A framework is needed to guide in the development of such systems. However, due to the varying needs of patients, team types and make-up would generally differ, so we explored the different types of team settings studying what they entail based on their various degrees of collaboration.   We therefore present in this thesis a model of team based concepts, an ontology formalizing the model, team based scenarios designed using the ontology and then application of the scenarios to test the ability of BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) to model healthcare teams.

T1  - Spatial reference in Sumu-Mayangna, Nicaraguan Spanish, and Barcelona Spanish
AN  - 1316620219
AB  - This dissertation examines linguistic spatial frame of reference (FoR) usage across three cohorts, detailing the lexical and structural realization of particular spatial FoR classes within each linguistic community, as well as which linguistic and nonlinguistic factors are predictors of spatial FoR class usage.   This study was designed to determine the degree to which language and environment are predictive factors of spatial FoR performance. Sumu-Mayangna (Misumalpan; Nicaragua) and Nicaraguan Spanish were chosen because while their speakers share a local environment, the languages are genetically unrelated. On the other hand, Nicaraguan Spanish and Barcelona Spanish were chosen because, apart from speakers' access to similar linguistic resources, speakers of these two varieties occupy rather different environments. Over thirty-two hours of discourse data from three referential communication tasks were analyzed using generalized logit mixed models. Descriptive and predictive statistical analyses indicate that a constellation of factors are significant in terms of the production of linguistic spatial FoR preference across cohorts and tasks. Cohort, language, and environment were found to be predictive factors, with language identified as the most common predictor of spatial FoR usage. In contrast, age and gender were found to be marginally predictive.   A subsequent qualitative analysis elaborates upon the quantitative results, showing that between speakers of the two Spanish varieties, there is evidence of an asymmetry in form-to-concept mapping with regard to spatial relators. In the same vein, spatial relators in Sumu-Mayangna are discussed in the context of meronymy. The relative productivity and geometric organization of the Sumu-Mayangna meronymy system is discussed. Additionally, evidence found to be supportive of Bohnemeyer's meronymy hypothesis is presented, which provides some explanation as to the non-preference of relative spatial FoR classes in the Sumu-Mayangna case. This study concludes that a combination of factors may ultimately predict spatial FoR usage, with language, and specifically, its attendant community-specific discourse practices, playing a unique role.

T1  - Use of Conceptual and Procedural Knowledge Mapping to Improve Learning in a Lecture-Laboratory Microbiology Course
AN  - 1286751053
AB  - Promoting successful learning is key in developing students from novice to professionals in their respective fields of study.  In the field of science, students have long practiced the art of memorization without complete understanding.  To combat this common problem, Joseph Novak and D. Bob Gowin, constructed two metacognitive tools.  These metacognitive tools, concept mapping and Vee heuristic, were developed with the hopes of providing students with a way to connect concepts, principles, and theories similar to their professors.     The purpose of this study was to use these two tools as a way to promote successful learning among college-level science students.  Both of these metacognitive tools were given to students enrolled in a microbiology lecture-laboratory course (BIOL 2110/2111 and BIOL 3220/3221).  Concept mapping and the Vee heuristic were given to students in the guise of a study guide, in hopes to promote constant use and easy access.  As a way to measure students' improvement in learning, two assessments general knowledge of microbiology (GKM) and public knowledge of microbiology (PKM) were constructed and given to students periodically throughout the course of the study.     After the study's completion it was found that those students using the study guide regularly appeared to have a better understanding of the basic concepts required to successfully learn microbiology.  Additionally students enrolled in BIOL 3220/3221 who used the study guide with help from a knowledgeable instructor significantly scored higher on the GKM assessment than the control group of students.  Also discovered during the course of this study was nursing students attitudes towards scientific concepts.  This particular find has important implications regarding the outcomes of this study.

T1  - Concept mapping for planning and evaluation of a community-based initiative
AN  - 1284159171
AB  - Community-based initiatives address community issues by providing a multi-agency approach to prevention and intervention services (Connell et al.,1995). When incorporating multiple agencies, it can be challenging to obtain multiple perspectives and gaining consensus on the priorities and direction for these initiatives. This study employed a participatory approach called concept mapping to build consensus amongst stakeholder groups in a victims' assistance program. This multiple-method technique provided visual representations of the findings assessing community initiative providers' perceptions of barriers to accessing victim's assistance services for children and families who experience or witness violence or trauma. Visualizations organized findings into interpretable groups of statements to label and provide actionable next steps for community initiative providers. Several results of interest emerged from this study. First, there are varying community and system facets that providers perceive to be barriers to children's and families' access to care; some are within the trauma provider system of care whereas other barriers are perpetuated within the community. In addition, stakeholders rated barriers based on their prevalence and capacity to change within the community. Average ratings varied by cluster, with distrust of the trauma-informed system of care as the most prevalent barrier and workforce development as the barrier noted as the easiest to change. Stakeholder group ratings for prevalence of all clusters were higher for program staff than from law enforcement officers and mental health providers whereas ratings for capacity to change were in greater agreement between stakeholder groups overall. Moreover, program staff noted that the concept mapping process and visualizations provided them with a means to discuss actionable steps with community-based initiative providers of the victim's assistance program as a whole.

T1  - Concept mapping enhances critical thinking skills in the vocational/practical nursing curriculum
AN  - 1271756669
AB  - This study postulates that introducing Concept Mapping (CM) as an alternative pedagogy could enhance a Vocational Nursing (VN)/Practical Nursing (PN) nursing student's critical thinking ability. The Nursing Process is introduced at the beginning of the VN/PN training program. Critical thinking is an essential and fundamental skill, which incorporates the Nursing Process (NP). Concept mapping has been an influential teaching methodology used in various educational contexts. The research outcome is measured by the National League for Nursing Critical Thinking (NLN-CT) and the Comprehensive Achievement (NLN-CA) exams. This action research integrated the CM in a VN nursing curriculum as an alternative teaching method to improve critical thinking ability. There was a statistically significant (p<.01) improvement in the measured critical thinking skills for the experimental group before and after the CM introduction. Graduates who applied concept mapping might improve the Practical Nurses' National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX/PN) passing probability. Unexpectedly, the rote learning control group performed significantly (p<.01) better on the NLN-CA, which is a predicating tool of the probability to pass NCLEX. Several explanations for this counterintuitive finding are reported.

T1  - Students' perceptions, attitudes, and incorporation of demonstrations, popular media videos, and animations concerning chemical reactions
AN  - 1238327301
AB  - Students often struggle with learning complex chemistry concepts.  In today's society with the advances in multimedia technology, educators have a variety of tools available to help students learn these concepts.  These tools include demonstrations, videos in the popular media, and animations; referred to collectively as multimethods.  With the increase in possibilities educators must consider a variety of factors, the most important of which is their students.  An examination of the literature leaves questions regarding the views of students as well as the impact of these tools on student learning.  This study qualitatively explores student perceptions and attitudes regarding each of these multimethods using open-ended surveys, worksheets, interviews, and audio recordings.  Concept maps and drawings provide insight into how students incorporate information from these multimethods into their understanding of chemical reactions.       The results of the study emphasize variety for student perceptions, attitudes, conceptions, and the way they incorporate information from the multimethods.  However, there also were trends in that the majority of students preferred demonstrations and the macro level.  The students appeared to be aware that the use of these multimethods is designed to help them learn.  Student drawings and concept maps additionally indicate a lack of understanding of the nature of chemical reactions and a failure to incorporate the information in a substantial way.  Finally, implications for teaching are discussed.

T1  - Enhancing Learning Through The Use Of Graphic Organizers to Teach Science to Grade Eleven Students in Jamaica
AN  - 1170996054
AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using concept mapping via the web-based software Inspiration to teach grade 11 students ‘Nutrition in Humans’. The sample consisted of 60 students, with an average age 16.4 years who were enrolled in a co-ed high school in western Jamaica. Three instruments were used: an observation schedule designed to determine the frequency of chorus answering for each lesson; an anxiety questionnaire consisting of 16 statements; and a Biology achievement test of 30 recall and application questions constructed by the researcher. The anxiety and biology instruments were administered before and after the 7 weeks of teaching the topics using concept mapping via the web-based software as well as by paper and pencil. The results showed that after students had been taught using the Inspiration, their anxiety levels decreased, the frequency of chorus answering decreased, and their biology achievement significantly improved. It was concluded that concept mapping using the web-based software Inspiration was effective in teaching grade 11 students ‘Nutrition in Humans’.

T1  - Investigating the nature of third grade students' experiences with concept maps to support learning of science concepts
AN  - 1152048303
AB  - To support and improve effective science teaching, educators need methods to reveal student understandings and misconceptions of science concepts and to offer all students an opportunity to reflect on their own knowledge construction and organization. Students can benefit by engaging in scientific activities in which they build personal connections between what they learn and their own experiences. Integrating student-constructed digital concept mapping into the science curriculum can reveal to both students and teachers the conceptual organization and understanding of science content, which can assist in building connections between concepts and personal experiences. I used a qualitative case study research design in which my setting was one third-grade classroom. Participants were the teacher and student in this classroom. This paper describes how a class of third grade students used concept maps to understand science concepts (specifically, "watershed systems"). During class discussions and interviews students revised concept map content and structure as their ideas developed. The results of this study demonstrated how students' understandings and misconceptions were revealed through their construction of digital concept maps over time. Each new concept map built upon the previous one for a total of seven maps per student. Analyses of the concept maps using an evaluative rubric revealed changes over time in concept map structure and content. A formal assessment of watershed concepts was administered four times during the course of the science unit. I conclude that my research model used for integrating concept maps in this science class enabled students to reflect deeply on their work and to accurately revise their knowledge construction and content. Using concept maps to inform her teaching, the teacher also made robust use of the research model.

T1  - Parent's Perception of Professional Contacts during their Adaptation to Caring for a Child with Disabilities
AN  - 1152034014
AB  - The key objective of this study was to identify and describe parents’ perceptions of professional practices that enhanced or undermined their parental roles and their relationships with their children who have disabilities. In phase one, participants in a focus group were asked to generate responses to the two open-ended questions: (1) “Please describe the important things that professionals have said or done that made you feel better or more secure in your relationship with your child and your role as a parent of a child with a disability”, and (2) “Please describe the important things that professionals have said or done that made you feel worse or less secure in your relationship with your child and your role as a parent of a child with a disability.” Two lists of statements were generated, sorted, and rated by participants. Consequently, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to analyze the data to create concept maps. The parents’ positive perceptions of professional practices consisted of 5 themes: (1) Supportive services from health professionals, (2) Psychological support from health professionals, (3) Supportive care-workers, (4) Social services help with home-life balance, and (5) Supportive school professionals. The parents’ negative perceptions of professional contacts consisted of 6 themes: (1) Inadequacy of school professionals, (2) Conflict with health professionals, (3) Professionals’ ignorance, (4) Social service professionals’ lack of empathy, (5) Fight for social services, and (6) Funding issues.   In phase two, an incidence survey was developed based upon parents’ reported statements. Administering the survey to parents of individuals with disabilities who attended the Elves Special Needs Society programs in Edmonton, Alberta, determined the extent to which other parents perceived similar positive or negative experiences with professional contacts. All 5 clusters from the map on parents’ positive perceptions of professional practices received a significant amount of agreement responses. Respondent variability existed at the level of individual items within “inadequacy of school professionals” and “conflict with health professionals” categories. The findings are important to guide practice for professionals in the field of disabilities services.

T1  - Using Concept Mapping to Identify Action Steps for Physical Activity Promotion in Cancer Treatment
AN  - 1113335366
AB  - The benefits of exercise during and after cancer treatment represent research areas that have received increased attention throughout the past two decades. Numerous benefits have been observed for cancer survivors who are physically active (Speck, Courneya, Masse, Duval & Schmitz, 2010). Yet oncologists have been slow to incorporate exercise counseling into practice (Daley et al., 2007). The objective of this study was to gather input from both researchers and oncologists as to what needs to happen for exercise to become part of standard care once treatment ends. The concept mapping process developed by Trochim and Kane (2007) was utilized to realize this goal. A total of 37 unique ideas were produced by participants and were grouped into six-clusters: “Education,” “Inclusion of Exercise Professionals,” “Changes within the Current Oncology Environment,” “Research,” “Needed Components of Exercise Programs,” and “Patient Focused.” Each of these clusters represents an area of concentration where changes are suggested for further promotion of PA for cancer survivors. Participants also rated each idea on its importance and feasibility. The “Education” cluster included many of the ideas that were rated highly on both of these variables and as such may serve as an ideal starting point for increasing cancer survivors’ exercise levels. Additionally, results revealed differences between researchers and oncologists with regard to how they ranked the ideas in terms of importance and feasibility.

T1  - Embedding Evolution: Exploring Changes in Students' Conceptual Development, Beliefs, and Motivations in a Population Ecology Unit
AN  - 1098462543
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore student changes in conceptual development, epistemology, and motivations when evolution concepts are embedded and explicit reflective discourse is used in a unit for population ecology. The two research problems were: (1) What changes are observed in student's conceptual development, epistemology, and motivations when there is explicit reflective discourse within a population ecology unit with embedded evolution?, and (2) In what ways does explicit reflection influence students' mental models within a population ecology unit with embedded evolution? This mixed-method, quasi-experimental study assessed two regular high school biology classes in a small, urban, Midwestern high school. Students in this study had not studied evolution within any formal chapters, but had been immersed in a curriculum with embedded evolution. The study was conducted over a four-week period in a population ecology unit near the beginning of second semester. Instruction emphasized basic conceptions in population ecology. Five key intervention activities included evolutionary concepts as part of an embedded curriculum. The independent variable was explicit reflective discourse with one or two intervention questions after completion of these activities. Data included pre- and posttest surveys measuring (a) evolutionary understanding of natural selection, (b) science beliefs, and (c) science motivations. Written artifacts included (a) explanations to scenarios, (b) pre- and post-argument reflections revealing student's science beliefs and science motivations resultant from two argumentations, and (c) three, pre-, post-, and 6-week final concept maps constructed from 12 concepts. All data sources provided descriptive data. Conceptual change was interpreted from an ontological, epistemological, and motivational perspective. The experimental class receiving explicit reflective discourse showed greater overall increases in conceptual development. Students in both classes constructed teleological and proximate explanations. Overall, the experimental class gave greater numbers of evolutionary explanations. Scored propositions from concept maps showed a mixture of synthetic and scientific conceptions in both classes, however the experimental group showed greater scientific quality. Students in both classes exhibited direct-process ontology. Both classes had high degrees of epistemological and motivational commitments demonstrated by their engagement and subsequent improvements in conceptual development in both evolutionary and ecological conceptions.

T1  - The Use of Concept Mapping/Pattern Matching to Determine the Content Domain for Information Literacy in Baccalaureate Education
AN  - 1098093678
AB  - This study assessed the relevance of a national association’s standards for developing information literacy competency in undergraduate students at a mid-sized, regional university in Maryland. Key stakeholders responsible for ensuring student success in achieving information literacy competency at the institution were solicited for their expertise to identify the outcomes they consider to indicate information literacy competency. The group of 14 participants included six faculty, three librarians, three student affairs professionals, and two students. Trochim’s Concept Mapping/Pattern Matching methodology was used for gathering and analyzing the data to conceptualize the domain of information literacy competencies. The key stakeholders generated 80 student learning outcomes for information literacy. Using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, the outcomes were grouped into eight clusters representing the content domain for information literacy. Following the creation of the concept maps, the resulting priorities and their conceptualization schema were compared to the national organization’s standards for similarities and differences in a qualitative document analysis. They were also compared to the learning outcomes for information literacy currently associated with the institution’s general education curriculum and the library’s instruction program.    The study revealed four conclusions. First, the national standards for information literacy are relevant at the local level. Second, there is a need for academic libraries to reevaluate their existing information literacy outcomes to reflect changes in information dissemination from a textual bias to include multi-media. Third, it is important for academic institutions to include representation of all stakeholders when developing student learning outcomes. Fourth, ambiguity still exists among stakeholders in regard to the effectiveness of teaching information literacy.

T1  - Early childhood teachers' self-efficacy toward teaching science: Outcomes of professional development
AN  - 1039267709
AB  - The teaching of science in the early childhood classrooms has slowly been decreasing. As the years have passed, the subject of science has been put on the backburner while mathematics and language arts have taken center stage in the educational system. Early childhood teachers need to find ways to integrate science with other subjects in order to ensure children are receiving a well-rounded and full education. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of professional development on teachers' efficacy in teaching science. Volunteer teachers completed the Weisgram and Bigler scale (TWBS) pre and post training, in order to determine their self-efficacy toward teaching science, they also completed pre- and post- concept maps about their knowledge of teaching science, and a demographic questionnaire.   Findings indicate the training provided was effective in increasing teachers' knowledge of teaching science. Teachers who had an increase in science teaching knowledge were also found to feel more efficacious about teaching science after completing the training and an academic year of implementing science lessons in their classrooms. There was not a relationship between teacher demographics and their science-teaching efficacy.  This means that the demographics of participants in this study were not influential on teachers' efficacy, but professional development workshops enabled teachers to gain more knowledge about teaching as well as increase their efficacy about teaching science.

T1  - Mapping expert supervisors' cognitions
AN  - 1039146973
AB  - Since the essential role of counseling supervision for counselor growth and effectiveness was emphasized in several seminal articles in the 1980s (Blocher, 1983; Loganbill, Hardy, & Delworth, 1982), many researchers have investigated the complex factors involved in effective counseling supervision. However, within this large body of work, very few researchers have sought to describe the master, or expert, supervisor.   When researchers have studied supervisors, typically participants were supervisors under training and relatively inexperienced supervisors (Borders & Fong, 1994; Luke, Ellis, & Bernard, 2011). Very few researchers have studied more experienced supervisors (Nelson, Barnes, Evans, & Triggiano, 2008). Although these studies were informative, none were focused on expert supervisors. Thus, an investigation of expert supervisors is considered to be crucial for furthering our understanding of effective counseling supervision practices as well as improving supervisor training efforts.   Hence, the specific focus of this study was to explore expert supervisors' cognitions and cognitive structures through a mixed-method approach called concept mapping. Data were obtained through three rounds of data collection. In the first round, participants generated statements through an open-ended internet survey. In the second round, the researcher mailed out the edited and synthesized statements to participants for the sorting and rating tasks. In the third round, an online focus group session was conducted with a subgroup of participants. A total of 18 expert supervisors completed at least one round of data collection procedure.    Expert supervisors generated 479 statements, or cognitions/thoughts, regarding their thinking while they were planning for, conducting, and evaluating their supervision sessions. These statements were edited and synthesized into a final set of 195. Analyses and the focus group session resulted in summarizing these statements into 25 clusters or cognitive categories/domains. These cognitive categories/domains indicated that expert supervisors' thinking involved many different supervision components. Supervision Models, such as the Discrimination Model (Bernard & Goodyear, 2009), Developmental Models (Stoltenberg, 1981; Loganbill et al., 1982), and the Systems Approach to Supervision Model (Holloway, 1995), were represented in the results of the present study. However, the representation of these models was at the statement level and none of the cognitive categories/domains were named after these models.   Furthermore, five separate but related regions appeared on the cluster map based on the conceptual similarities of these cognitive categories/domains. These regions were Assessment of the Supervisee and His/Her Work, Supervisory Relationship, Supervisor Self-Assessment and Reflection, Conceptualization of Supervision and Intervening, and Administration Considerations.   Lastly, expert supervisors appeared to be giving more importance or higher priority to almost all of the cognitive categories while they were working with challenging supervisees when compared to easy supervisees. Expert supervisors' ratings also indicated that "Supervisee Development," "The Client and the Counseling Session," and "Supervisor's Goal Setting/Agenda Setting" clusters were in the higher importance/priority list for both easy and challenging supervisees.   The findings of the present study provide direction for future research and useful implications for supervisors and supervisor training programs.

T1  - Learnable Interfaces - Leveraging Navigation by Design
AN  - 1038943746
AB  - Complex productivity applications that integrate tasks in the workplace are becoming more common. Usability typically focuses on short-term, immediate measures of task performance. This study incorporates a long-term goal of more durable learning, focusing on implicit learning (spontaneous, unplanned, usually unconscious learning as a result of other activities). It looks at how the design of complex applications can facilitate such incidental learning of both the application and the task domain when a conceptual model of the task domain is intentionally embedded. This can lead to more productive communication lower development and training costs, and improved task performance. The study targets the navigation interface as a gateway to exposing structural knowledge about the task domain as well as the organization of the application. Schema theory and cognitive load are discussed.     The study used an application developed to design and manage lessons in large training programs. The application reflected an explicit conceptual model of Instructional Systems Design (ISD). The experiment was conducted over the internet and exposed a range of users to application tasks using one of three. navigation interfaces. These menus reflected the underlying model to different degrees; content pages were the same. The pre-test assessed participants' understanding of the embedded model as a baseline. A series of typical application tasks ensured exposure to concepts. Performance and subjective data were collected to assist interpretation of results. The test, a multiple choice version of concept map assessment, was then repeated to show changes in model alignment.      Despite very brief contact time, the study confirmed that application interaction led to learning and greater alignment with the embedded model on all three measures: relationships, sequence, and vocabulary.  Interaction was influenced by the cognitive load of high perceived difficulty and unfamiliarity and by the dominance of time spent on content pages over navigation time. Trends indicate a preference for constant menu visibility, familiarity, and simplicity (low informational density). Performance and learning for treatments reflecting the embedded model faired better than the standard Windows menu which shows only the application organization, not the embedded model.

T1  - Incorporating formative assessment and science content into elementary science methods—A case study
AN  - 1038368305
AB  - Just as elementary students enter the science classroom with prior knowledge and experiences, so do preservice elementary teachers who enter the science methods classroom. Elementary science methods instructors recognize the challenges associated with preparing teachers for the science classroom. Two of these challenges include overcoming limited science content understanding and a low science teaching efficacy. Based upon research in science misconceptions, conceptual change theory, formative assessment, and science teaching efficacy, this design experiment explored the use of formative assessment in an authentic learning environment to address some of these challenges. As a case study, the goal was to identify two specific topics in science which the preservice teachers did not understand and to model consistent use of formative assessment to guide instruction in those science topics for six weeks.   The research questions for this study sought to explore the design of the class while also exploring students' understanding of the science content and their understanding of formative assessment. One specific question was whether the formative data could differentiate between deeply held student misconceptions in science and incomplete science understanding. In addition, data was collected to measure changes in science teaching efficacy as well as preservice teachers' desire to use formative assessment in their own future classrooms.   Based upon student interviews and a final content quiz, the participants in this study did show improved science content understanding in the areas of plant food/energy and plate tectonics. The course design implemented a variety of formative assessment tools including formative assessment probes, student science notebooks, student concept maps, a non-graded quiz, and more. The STEBI-B survey identified improved science teaching efficacy among the participants. Student final essays indicated improved understanding of formative assessment and students also expressed a desire to incorporate formative assessment into their future teaching. Final reflections on this case study recognize the value of formative assessment as a means for improved communication between students and teachers about student understanding in an effort to provide and model more effective science instruction.

T1  - Cultural competence in the baccalaureate degree nursing curriculum
AN  - 1038363292
AB  - Health care providers are members of a helping profession and need to provide quality care to all members of society. As a result of current and projected demographic changes within the United States (U.S.), health care professionals are faced with the challenges of providing culturally competent care and fulfilling the role as the "helping profession." In the past 10 years, minority populations have increased in the U.S. For example, the African American population experienced an approximate 12.3% increase, and the Hispanic population increased by 43%. Just as it is necessary for health care professionals to respond to the increase in the geriatric population as a result of the Baby Boomer generation, it is crucial to address the needs of an increasingly culturally diverse population in the U.S. Preparing to care for a culturally diverse population begins during the teaching and learning process in the nursing curriculum. This study intended to identify the methods in which nursing programs are integrating cultural concepts in their plan of study.      Josepha Campinha-Bacote's model titled "The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Health Care Services" was used as the theoretical framework to guide this study. Campinha-Bacote has studied transcultural nursing and has added to the current body of nursing knowledge with regard to incorporating cultural concepts in the nursing curriculum. This model requires health care professionals to see themselves as becoming culturally competent rather than  being culturally competent and involves the integration of cultural awareness, cultural skill, cultural knowledge, cultural encounters, and cultural desire.     An electronic survey was sent using Survey Monkey to 298 schools in the Northeast and Southern regions of the United States. The survey was sent on January 19, 2012 and remained open for 20 days. Once the survey closed, statistical analyses were conducted using frequencies and cross-tabluations, and the findings were analyzed and reported. The results of the study indicated the following: (a) a low number of schools incorporating a stand-alone nursing course in the curriculum; (b) differences among various teaching methods among regions and program types; (c) differences among the incorporation of Campinha-Bacote's (2007b) cultural constructs in the curriculum; and (d) differences among various evaluation methods among regions and program types.      Implications for nursing education include the following: (a) programs should make an effort to incorporate one-to-one instruction and simulation when planning teaching encounters in order to adequately address all learning domains; (b) when planning curriculum structure, programs should consider using a theoretical framework such as Campinha-Bacote's (2007b) "The Process of Cultural Competence in the Delivery of Health Care Service" in order to address student learning needs thoroughly; (c) nursing faculty members need to be creative in their teaching and make a conscious effort to continually address cultural learning needs of their students; and (d) concept mapping should be used to determine where and how many times cultural concepts are addressed in the curriculum.     Recommendations for future research include: (a) determining which teaching methods are most effective in promoting cultural competence; (b) determining the use and effectiveness of curriculum methods that incorporate Campinha-Bacote's (2007b) cultural constructs; (c) determining which evaluation methods are most effective in determining student ability to care for others of another culture; and (d) learning about faculty comfort and preparedness to teach culture-related nursing content. It is also recommended that the relationship between a stand-alone nursing course versus and integrated course and cultural competence be investigated.

T1  - The Dynamic Interplay between Spatialization of Written Units in Writing Activity and Functions of Tools on the Computer
AN  - 1034721600
AB  - I criticize the typewriting model and linear writing structure of Microsoft Word software for writing in the computer. I problematize bodily movement in writing that the error of the software disregards. In this research, writing activity is viewed as bodily, spatial and mediated activity under the premise of the unity of consciousness and activity, and embodied mind. In order to explore the role and importance of bodily movement in writing tools, I hypothesized that when tools respond to human bodily movement well, and when they work as if they are extensions of the body, the best conditions of use during the process of writing will be possible. Also, spatial arrangement activity in writing was assumed to be a self-generated tool-making process for writing that regulates thought and behavior. And, I supposed that spatial image schemas could be manipulated with conceptually in the activity of writing.    In an attempt to examine the assumption and hypothesis, and develop the concept, I investigated design graduate students’ thesis document writing process in which I specifically checked the assumption by studying the effects of spatial activity. The design graduate students’ writing process was interpreted through the lenses of activity theory, embodied reasoning, and Csikszentmihalyi’s creative process model which included preparation, incubation, insight, evaluation and elaboration.    I found that spatial activities such as the physical manipulation of written units, spatializing words, creating signs, and manipulating spatial-formal relations for concept development played an important role in reading, understanding, connecting, analyzing, synthesizing, hierarchizing, structuring, remembering, retrieving, communicating, a design project, an explorative research process, and integrating reading, a design project into writing. In the beginning of the writing process, having an hierarchically organized representation of conceptual relations of the thesis statement, problem areas, key words and theories by spatial arrangements of written units aided in its use in evolving writing structure and expansion of thought in imagination. Spatially externalizing thought played an important role in embodying the relationship between the reality where the research problem was located, knowledge, and embodied imagination, which was the function of mediated activity. The process of embodiment necessitated special qualities of writing tools with respect to bodily movement.    The indeterminate qualities of writing tools enabled the correlation of the body, gesture, and the written units that the body manipulated to be physically easier. From an unorganized material basis, manipulating conceptual relations consisted of concrete physical skills such as using Post-its, making matrices, outlines, note cards, user path maps, concept maps, narrative concept maps, signs, sketch, diagrams, and models. Writers showed the significant difference in perceptions of tool affordances and concrete skills. In relation to spatial activity in the use of writing tools, writers showed five types of difference: an intensity of motivation, acquisition of a new tool-mediation, practice and a cognitive effort, a tendency to limit bodily, spatial and mediated activity within design activity, and increasing perceptions of tool affordances in proportion to practice, i.e., changing perceptions of tool affordances depending on an activity or developmental aspects. The perceptions of tool affordances did not form writer’s meaningful activity. In conclusion, the expansion of thought was activated by making processes involving bodily movement, which produced the differences in the writing processes. The productive role of spatialization of written units involving physical manipulation in writing suggested a need for spatial activities in writing software in the computer.

T1  - Relationships between concept mapping and critical thinking skills of vocational nursing students
AN  - 1034591534
AB  - The task of developing vocational nursing students' critical thinking abilities is one of the greatest challenges facing nurse educators today. Licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) must be trained to think critically in order to provide safe patient care. Due to the expanded role and functions in the LVN's scope of practice, LVNs are making more complex decisions than ever before. The purpose of this study was to investigate concept mapping as a teaching strategy and the extent to which concept mapping impacts students' critical thinking skills and academic performance. A convenience sample of the entire enrollment of medical-surgical nursing course vocational nursing students (n = 33) participated in this quantitative descriptive study. Subjects completed two questionnaires: the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (Facione & Facione, 2000) to measure their critical thinking skills; and the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (Facione & Facione, 1992) to measure their dispositions to think critically. Researcher created a demographic data form to collect gender, age, educational status, and academic level completed in the nursing program. Subjects' concept mapping grades were accessed for comparison with survey data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and t test. No difference in CCTST posttest scores are found between vocational nursing students' CCTST pretest scores. Overall, nursing students had high concept mapping scores, which are associated with increased critical thinking skills. Survey data supported a correlation between CCTDI posttest scores and concept mapping scores when compared to CCTDI pretest scores. Participants' dispositions toward critical thinking were positively correlated with the written achievement on concept maps as an increase in critical thinking skills. Findings from this study have implications for practice and vocational nursing education, and they support recommendations for future research. Critical thinking skills and dispositions to think critically can have a critical impact on whether an LVN is capable of practicing competently and safely in situations that involve clinical decision making in long-term care facilities, home-healthcare agencies, and other expanded roles of the licensed vocational nurse.

T1  - Baptist Congregational Leadership: A Case Study of Invitational Practice
AN  - 1034251201
AB  - Most, if not all, organizations imperfectly translate espoused theory into theory-in-practice, and faith communities are no exception (Argyris & Schon, 1974; Reid, 2004). Invitational Leadership Theory (ILT) has been used effectively to help education based organizations reduce this discrepancy, but no research is available which considers ILT within churches (Purkey & Siegel, 2003, Stanley & Purkey, 2005). This qualitative case study documents and analyzes leadership experience and practice through the lens of Invitational Leadership Theory in three Baptist churches affiliated with the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship (CBF). An initial concept map of ILT identified foundations, assumptions, dimensions, areas, outcomes and conflict management (Purkey, 1991; Purkey & Novak, 1996). These six concepts from previous research were found to be present in the case study, but did not fully capture three issues that were found within the CBF affiliated churches: (a) theological understanding, (b) autonomy of the individual believers and the churches, and (c) positive role instability. The ILT concept map was adapted to better represent Baptist church leadership with the following changes: (a) Theology is included within the Foundations; (b) Priorities and Provisions were added as additional categories in the Areas; (c) the Dimensions were re-categorized, focusing on the intellectual, physical, spiritual and communal aspects of self and others; and (d) Vision and Inspiration replace Intentionality and Optimism in the Assumptions.

T1  - Employment of an Informal Educational Mathematical Facility to Lower Math Anxiety and Improve Teacher and Student Attitudes Towards Understanding Mathematics
AN  - 1033342269
AB  - Students do not pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) because of a lack of ability, but rather a lack of positive experiences with mathematics. Research has concluded that attitudes in math directly influence success in mathematics. As many as 75% of high school graduates in the United States suffer from mild to severe forms of math anxiety. The improvement of student achievement in mathematics in the United States lags behind that of many other nations in the world. Efforts to improve student achievement in mathematics have focused on developing effective teachers and teaching practices, creating state and national standards, and raising test scores. Advances in neuroscience and understanding how the brain learns mathematics are often not reflected in current instructional practices, and being "bad at math" is not viewed as a problem by American society. As a response to the current state of mathematics in the United States, the researcher created an informal educational center to provide positive mathematical experiences that demonstrate how math works. The Metamo4ic Math Center opened in 2007.     This study investigated the effectiveness of a two-hour field trip visit to the Math Center on 114 elementary students, six teachers, and 42 preservice teachers. A Math Anxiety Scale - Revised (MAS-R) and knowledge concept map were administered to treatment and control groups pre-visit, post-visit, and post-post visit. Interviews were conducted pre and post visit. In addition, an independent evaluator observed each field trip visit.     The results of the study indicated that the Math Center does significantly lessen anxiety and reduce negative attitudes toward mathematics in elementary students and their teachers. Although pre-service teachers demonstrated a lessening in anxiety, the decrease was not significant, and the results demonstrated that the pre-service teachers in both the treatment and control groups had anxiety levels significantly higher than the student and in-service teacher groups. This study led the researcher to conclude that a "Cycle of Anxiety" is contagious and continually perpetuated through the current instruction of mathematics. This study indicated that efforts to improve math achievement void of addressing negative attitudes and math anxiety might not be successful.

T1  - A study of urban African American students' conceptions of school and media science
AN  - 1033176859
AB  - In order to inquire into the persistent underrepresentation of urban minority students in the sciences, this study explored three urban African American students' conceptualizations of school science and media science, with emphases on the representation of science in Crime Scene Investigation  (CSI). Based on the data collected from interviews, classroom observations, student journals, focus groups, concept maps, and artifacts, the study shows that the student participants conceptualize school science as a compilation of observed chemical reactions, utilizing specific laboratory apparatus, and laboratory experiments. The study also shows that student participants conceptualize media science as an accruement of evidence collection, observation, photography, analyses of evidence on and off site, and taking safety precautions. While the student participants did not find school science to be applicable in their daily lives, they believed that they had acquired usable and accurate scientific knowledge from media science. Two major themes emerged from the student participants' voices: student participants' acute awareness of their limited access to the scientific world, and student participants' inadequate accruement of scientific knowledge through school and media science. By attending to the student participants' voices, this study lends support to advocating for and developing culturally responsive pedagogy in science education that will facilitate urban students' active engagement and improve their achievement in science education.

T1  - A phenomenological study of the experiences of women in leadership and community at Old Dominion University from 1970 to 1990
AN  - 1015334492
AB  - During the 1970s college campuses in the United States were often the venue through which change occurred. Female faculty and students were assertive in their efforts to influence equality between men and women across the country (Morris, 1984). This historical phenomenological study examined the oral history of several women who advocated for women's rights at Old Dominion University (ODU) by establishing the Women's Caucus, Women's Studies Program, and Women's Center during the late 1970s through the 1990s.    Participants selected for this study took part in semi-structured interviews, and the results of the interviews were triangulated with archived documents available at ODU and the City of Norfolk Public Library. Participants' stories provided historical context to the development of women's programs, which supported students, faculty, and staff today. The interviews were used to explore participants' experiences as members and leaders in the ODU community. Documentation complements the evidence of the women's movement, and supports that women on the traditional college campus during the time period of study perceptively had different experiences than men.    Using phenomenological data analysis (Wertz, 2005), interviews and historical documents were coded to identify textural and structural descriptions of the phenomena of interest (female leadership and community at ODU). Research team member bias was bracketed for the study, and the research team met on a weekly basis for consensus coding. Data management tools such as concept mapping, and other case displays (Miles & Huberman, 1994) were used in the study to describe the essence of the phenomena. Identified themes included equity, identity, unity, discrimination, and action.    The research questions were designed to investigate the phenomena of leadership, community and perceived change in those areas in connection to women's equity on campus at ODU. Findings indicated that women experienced in equity, and by taking roles in leadership and community at ODU, they have the perception that change has occurred in those areas.

T1  - Automatic domain adaptation of word sense disambiguation based on sublanguage semantic schemata applied to clinical narrative
AN  - 1011610003
AB  - Domain adaptation of natural language processing systems is challenging because it requires human expertise. While manual effort is effective in creating a high quality knowledge base, it is expensive and time consuming. Clinical text adds another layer of complexity to the task due to privacy and confidentiality restrictions that hinder the ability to share training corpora among different research groups. Semantic ambiguity is a major barrier for effective and accurate concept recognition by natural language processing systems.     In my research I propose an automated domain adaptation method that utilizes sub-language semantic schema for all-word word sense disambiguation of clinical narrative. According to the sublanguage theory developed by Zellig Harris, domain-specific language is characterized by a relatively small set of semantic classes that combine into a small number of sentence types. Previous research relied on manual analysis to create language models that could be used for more effective natural language processing. Building on previous semantic type disambiguation research, I propose a method of resolving semantic ambiguity utilizing automatically acquired semantic type disambiguation rules applied on clinical text ambiguously mapped to a standard set of concepts.     This research aims to provide an automatic method to acquire Sublanguage Semantic Schema (S3) and apply this model to disambiguate terms that map to more than one concept with different semantic types. The research is conducted using unmodified MetaMap version 2009, a concept recognition system provided by the National Library of Medicine, applied on a large set of clinical text. The project includes creating and comparing models, which are based on unambiguous concept mappings found in seventeen clinical note types. The effectiveness of the final application was validated through a manual review of a subset of processed clinical notes using recall, precision and F-score metrics.

T1  - Mapping biological ideas: Concept maps as knowledge integration tools for evolution education
AN  - 928947890
AB  - Many students leave school with a fragmented understanding of biology that does not allow them to connect their ideas to their everyday lives (Wandersee, 1989; Mintzes, Wandersee, & Novak, 1998; Mintzes, Wandersee, & Novak, 2000a). Understanding evolution ideas is seen as central to building an integrated knowledge of biology (Blackwell, Powell, & Dukes, 2003; Thagard & Findlay, 2010). However, the theory of evolution has been found difficult to understand as it incorporates a wide range of ideas from different areas (Bahar et al., 1999; Tsui & Treagust, 2003) and multiple interacting levels (Wilensky & Resnick, 1999; Duncan & Reiser, 2007; Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007). Research suggests that learners can hold a rich repertoire of co-existing alternative ideas of evolution (for example, Bishop & Anderson, 1990; Demastes, Good, & Peebles, 1996; Evans, 2008), especially of human evolution (for example, Nelson, 1986; Sinatra et al., 2003; Poling & Evans, 2004). Evolution ideas are difficult to understand because they often contradict existing alternative ideas (Mayr, 1982; Wolpert, 1994; Evans, 2008). Research suggests that understanding human evolution is a key to evolution education (for example, Blackwell et al., 2003; Besterman & Baggott la Velle, 2007).    This dissertation research investigates how different concept mapping forms embedded in a collaborative technology-enhanced learning environment can support students' integration of evolution ideas using case studies of human evolution. Knowledge Integration (KI) (Linn et al., 2000; Linn et al., 2004) is used as the operational framework to explore concept maps as knowledge integration tools to elicit, add, critically distinguish, group, connect, and sort out alternative evolution ideas. Concept maps are a form of node-link diagram for organizing and representing connections between ideas as a semantic network (Novak & Gowin, 1984). This dissertation research describes the iterative development of a novel biology-specific form of concept map, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), which aims to help learners connect ideas across levels (for example, genotype and phenotype levels) towards an integrated understanding of evolution.    Using a design-based research approach (Brown, 1992; Cobb et al., 2003), three iterative studies were implemented in ethically and economically diverse public high schools classrooms using the web-based inquiry science environment (WISE) (Linn et al., 2003; Linn et al., 2004).    Study 1 investigates concept maps as generative assessment tools. Study 1A compares the concept map generation and critique process of biology novices and experts. Findings suggest that concept maps are sensitive to different levels of knowledge integration but require scaffolding and revision. Study 1B investigates the implementation of concept maps as summative assessment tools in a WISE evolution module. Results indicate that concept maps can reveal connections between students' alternative ideas of evolution.    Study 2 introduces KIMs as embedded collaborative learning tools. After generating KIMs, student dyads revise KIMs through two different critique activities (comparison against an expert or peer generated KIM). Findings indicate that different critique activities can promote the use of different criteria for critique. Results suggest that the combination of generating and critiquing KIMs can support integrating evolution ideas but can be time-consuming.    As time in biology classrooms is limited, study 3 distinguishes the learning effects from either generating or critiquing KIMs as more time efficient embedded learning tools. Findings suggest that critiquing KIMs can be more time efficient than generating KIMs. Using KIMs that include common alternative ideas for critique activities can create genuine opportunities for students to critically reflect on new and existing ideas. Critiquing KIMs can encourage knowledge integration by fostering self-monitoring of students' learning progress, identifying knowledge gaps, and distinguishing alternative evolution ideas.    This dissertation research demonstrates that science instruction of complex topics, such as human evolution, can succeed through a combination of scaffolded inquiry activities using dynamic visualizations, explanation activities, and collaborative KIM activities. This research contributes to educational research and practice by describing ways to make KIMs effective and time efficient learning tools for evolution education. Supporting students' building of a more coherent understanding of core ideas of biology can foster their life-long interest and learning of science.

T1  - An Action Research Study to Determine the Feasibility of Using Concept Maps as Alternative Assessments by a Novice Teacher
AN  - 923290549
AB  - This action research study investigated the feasibility of a novice teacher using concept maps as assessments in secondary science classes.  The subjects in this study were the researcher, a novice pre-service science teacher, and students (n=35) in two classes of mixed-grade Foundations in Physics and Chemistry.  This study tracked student and teacher experiences over an instructional unit in astronomy.  All students received a 50-minute lesson on concept mapping, one class  received three additional concept mapping lessons during the unit, then  all students took a unit test with a paired short answer and concept map question.    Student surveys were conducted to gather student feedback, and teacher reflective journaling was used to track teacher data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. The results indicated that the extra concept mapping lessons did not result in higher scores on the concept maps or the paired short answer responses. The teacher journaling revealed that using concept mapping as an assessment tool was possible for a novice teacher.  Advantages and barriers were identified.

T1  - Toward conceptual development of a theory of clinical instructor identity using the experiences of medical laboratory science practitioners
AN  - 920878922
AB  - This study investigated medical laboratory science clinical instructors' beliefs about teaching and how they viewed themselves as teachers. The first phase of the study included an integrative literature review, which suggests that the development of teacher identity in school-based educators, and to a lesser extent higher education faculty, is dependent on four dimensions: personal factors, training factors, contextual factors, and reflective practice. Using a theory-building research technique, conceptual development of a theory of teacher identity was initiated based on these findings and the proposed theory is depicted in a concept map.     The second phase of this study began qualitative inquiry into the ways that these participants describe their professional identity and talk about their teaching. Interviews were conducted with medical laboratory science clinical instructors in order to gain an understanding of their perceptions of themselves as teachers. The data collected in this study indicate that this group of clinical instructors saw themselves as educators in a variety of ways. They saw themselves as teachers who were responsible for providing students with the technical skills needed to become  competent medical laboratory science practitioners and the theoretical foundation  necessary to pass the national certification exam. The study participants also saw  themselves as mentors who were responsible for passing along professional  knowledge to the next generation of laboratory practitioners.     During data analysis three themes emerged that represent aspects of teacher  identity in clinical instructors (clinical instructor identity): belief in one's teaching  ability (Nature vs. Nurture: We Have the Ability to Teach), desire to expand one's  professional responsibilities ( Professional Identity: Doing Something Extra), and  reflection on one's teaching (Thinking about Teaching Made Me a Better Teacher).  These themes and their supporting elements are generally consistent with the  dimensions of teacher identity identified in the literature review and the seminal  identity theories of Erikson (1956), Marcia (1966), and Gee (2001). The findings  from this study may provide a foundation for future research designed to measure  teacher identity in clinical instructors. Implications for practice are also included.

T1  - Quantitative Comparison of Traditional to Combined Online Instruction for Simple Linear Regression
AN  - 919561709
AB  - Businesses require statistically literate workers. This means people are capable of critical thinking, can analyze real-world data, and possess the ability to communicate their findings. In 2005, the American Statistical Association endorsed the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) college report (College Report, 2010), outlining ways to improve statistical literacy. The purpose of this exploratory study was to research a possible method of improving statistical literacy under the recommendations of the 2005 GAISE college report by comparing a combined approach of four online instructional methods to traditional methods of lecture and textbook for the topic of simple linear regression. The participants in the study were from MBA cohorts at a private Midwestern university. The research design was a pretest and posttest model with a control group (traditional methods,  N = 11) and quasi-experimental group (combined online methods,  N = 9). Using a Mann-Whitney U test, pretest score differences between groups were not statistically significant (z = -.699,  p = .485), while posttest scores differences between groups were significant (z = -2.265, p = .024). Using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, the control group pretest and posttest difference was not statistically different (z = -.960, p = .337), while the quasi-experimental group difference was statistically significant (z = -2.263, p = .024). This means the two groups started out the same, but ended up with a difference. The Chi-Square analyses for demographic variables showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The results provide evidence that additional research is worth pursuing and that effective and inexpensive online materials are achievable. The online materials are applicable to both corporate and university settings.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping and questioning on students' organization and retention of science knowledge while using interactive informational read-alouds
AN  - 909001832
AB  - According to recent assessment data, there is an urgent need to improve students’ knowledge of science. It has been suggested that the infusion of reading activities including concept mapping, questioning and interactive read-alouds can help students in learning science concepts. Little or no research has combined these methods to examine its effect on learning. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare concept mapping and questioning on students’ organization and retention of science knowledge when used with interactive informational read-alouds of science trade books. This study included 58 third grade students from four homogenous classes who were assigned to either a concept mapping group (experimental group) or a questioning with writing group (comparison group). With the same teacher, the school science specialist, the students completed an eight day unit regarding “soil formation” comprised of read-alouds, discussions and reading comprehension activities. (There were no hands-on, laboratory experiments.) Students were assessed on different types of knowledge.    Data were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA design to determine both within-factors (repeated measure), to show growth, and between-factors, to determine the difference between the two groups. The concept mapping group (experimental group) performed significantly higher than the questioning with writing group (comparison) on (a) relational vocabulary assessment (measuring relational knowledge); (b) multiple-choice assessment (measuring students’ ability to identify key ideas); and (c) writing assessment (measuring students’ relational thinking, students’ ability to retain and recall key information and students’ ability to use domain knowledge). The concept mapping group maintained these gains in a delayed assessment. The groups did not differ on individual word knowledge as measured by a matching assessment.    Recommendations are provided for teachers and researchers including using concept mapping in teaching science concepts to elementary students in conjunction with science text reading, as well as incorporating technology with computer-generated concept maps using Inspiration software.

T1  - Collective bargaining and faculty unionization: An administrative perspective
AN  - 903801767
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative case study was to gain insight into the perspectives of experienced higher education administrators regarding faculty unionization, the collective bargaining process, and the interpersonal relationships between higher education faculty members and administrators.    The primary method of data collection was semi-structured face to face interviews with nine administrators from two community colleges and two universities in the south Florida area. All of the study participants worked with unionized faculty members and had direct experience participating in bargaining negotiations.    Upon the completion of each interview, the researcher listened to the taped audio recording of the interview several times and then transcribed all of the information from the audiotape into a Word file. Data collection and analysis for each participant were performed concurrently. Using a modified concept mapping approach, the research questions were written on large yellow sticky notes and placed in the middle of a wall in the researcher’s home with nine descriptive categorical themes written on smaller sticky notes placed around the study questions. The highlighted quotes and key phrases were cut from each transcript and placed under each of the descriptive categories. Over the course of a few months repeatedly reviewing the research questions that guided this study, the theory of symbolic interactionism, and relevant literature the categorical descriptive themes were refined and condensed into five descriptive themes.    Study findings indicated that the administrators: (a) must have a clear understanding of what it is that the faculty does to be an effective representative at the bargaining table, (b) experienced role ambiguity and role strain related to a lack of understanding as to their role at the bargaining table and a lack of organizational support, (c) were not offered any type of training in preparation for bargaining, (d) perceived a definite “us versus them” mentality between faculty and administration, and (e) saw faculty collective bargaining at public institutions of higher education in Florida as ineffectual.

T1  - EL-Capstone scale development: An emergent literacy concept inventory
AN  - 897139743
AB  - The primary objective of this work was the scale development of a research-based instrument (EL-Capstone) that may be used to measure EL core-knowledge levels of adults working in an environment with expectations of supporting literacy development of young children. Earlier concept inventory, emergent literacy, and test theory literature informed the framework for this assessment instrument.    Designed with three distinct stages, pre-participant, participant, and post-participant, the processes was summarized by six general tasks: (1) define the content, (2) develop and select the instrument items, (3) informal informant sessions, (4) interview sessions with librarians and early literacy practitioners, (5) instrument administration, and (6) evaluation and final refinement. The entire consent-form participant activities centered on developing the items for inclusion in the EL-Capstone inventory.    During the first task, the Developing Early Literacy,  National Early Literacy Panel (NELP) 2008 Report was adopted as "EL-Expert" surrogates to bind the epistemological framework to the NELP authors' theoretical underpinnings of EL concepts. The NELP Report represents an extremely dense synthesis of the EL experimental and quasi-experimental research. By the end of the pre-participant stage concept-mapping activity, ninety-seven potential instrument items had been constructed that fell into three categories, i.e., predictiveness, definitions, and activities. Accompanying the refined sixty-two items presented during the interview sessions (n=10) were 3 ranking questions, i.e., strength of each concept, difficulty level, and perceived importance. The interview results informed instrument item reductions and modifications. Two alternating online versions of EL-Capstone collected data responses for 30 days from anonymous adult volunteers (n=824). An item response theory two-parameter logistic model (2-PL) was applied during the post-participant stage to identify each item's difficulty and discrimination parameters. When fully developed, this research-based scale may be used to measure EL-levels of adults working in an environment with expectations of supporting literacy development of young children. The subsequent collected information may be used to inform early literacy curriculum development and to support program evaluation.

T1  - Social sustainability considerations during planning and design: A framework of processes for construction projects
AN  - 893429743
AB  - With increased awareness of issues such as global resource shortages and climate change, sustainability efforts are becoming more common in the construction industry. While these efforts often consider economic and environmental factors, a truly sustainable construction project also needs to include such social considerations as its impact on the surrounding community and the safety, health, and education of the workforce. For the construction industry, social sustainability requires integrating processes for improving safety, health and well-being over the project life cycle. However, an empirical and comprehensive framework defining these social sustainability processes in construction projects has yet to be clearly delineated.     To address this need, this study identifies these processes and categorizes them into a framework for integrating and evaluating social considerations in construction projects. These processes focus on the planning and design phases because they offer the greatest potential for influencing project performance.  A concept mapping research method was applied to identify and categorize social sustainability processes based on the input of 25 experts from academia, industry and government. These experts contributed to process identification and then clustered and rated the processes based on similarity and importance, respectively. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis was applied to organize the experts' input into six categories defining social sustainability in construction projects: Stakeholder Engagement, User Considerations, Team Formation, Management Considerations, Impact Assessment, and Place Context.     The primary contribution of this research to the knowledge in the field is the expert-based social sustainability framework. Practitioners can benefit from the framework, which will enhance existing sustainability assessment methods and help address the challenge of developing truly sustainable projects. This framework also provides educators with a tool to teach students about social sustainability for construction projects. While this research advances understanding of social sustainability for construction projects, the framework was not validated for every type of construction project and construction project stakeholder. Given the differences between construction projects and between stakeholder perspectives, future research to validate the framework with other expert groups would be useful. In addition, future research suggested by this project could include the development of metrics based on the processes included in the framework. Beyond the framework itself, a secondary contribution to the field is the method for applying the concept mapping research method in the construction industry.

T1  - A design framework for sustainable infrastructure
AN  - 892738404
AB  - Aristotle theorized, "The whole is more than the sum of its parts." Design engineers often overlook this simple philosophy. We employ a reductionist approach when designing the built environment: engineering solutions for the individual parts rather than the system as a whole, creating and exacerbating problems in the process. A whole system, interdisciplinary approach that considers the interrelatedness of global issues is increasingly recognized as essential to finding truly sustainable engineering solutions (NSB, 2007). However, both the precise nature of this whole systems approach, and the best ways to incorporate it in engineering education remain undefined. To address this gap in knowledge, this research: (1) methodically reviewed the literature to define and unify the general principles of whole systems design; and (2) used the literature to develop a conceptual framework for whole systems design for sustainable infrastructure.      A systematic literature review guided by a predefined protocol used 13 search terms spanning the engineering, architecture, and planning disciplines to identify components of the whole systems framework. Sources identified in the literature review fell under five primary categories: sustainable development; architecture, planning, and urban design; engineering, environmental management and business; and systems thinking. Principles were extracted from the resources, empirically coded, and organized into a framework using concept mapping. The resulting framework was organized into three overarching categories: design processes, design principles, and design methods, with a total of 20 principles, or components of whole systems design. It combines the theories, perspectives, and practices of multiple design disciplines and experts making it germane for applications of design ranging from the microscopic level of a chemical, to the macroscopic level of a city, for example. Organizing the literature surrounding whole systems design aids in building consensus around the defining elements and sets the stage for future research on the subject.

T1  - Using concept mapping as as tool for program theory development
AN  - 889091487
AB  - The purpose of this methodological study is to explore how well a process called concept mapping (Trochim, 1989) can articulate the theory which underlies a social program.  Articulation of a program's theory is a key step in completing a sound theory based evaluation (Weiss, 1997a).  In this study, concept mapping is used to articulate the outcomes domain of a program theory, using Chen's (1990) six domains for program theory as an organizing framework.  A grassroots community organization in Denver, Colorado, provides context for the study.  With reference to Dubin's (1978) distinctions for theoretical units as a guide, the results of concept mapping are analyzed to determine whether they are useful in building a program theory.  Results are also are evaluated to determine whether they present a comprehensive, parsimonious (Whetten, 1989) and valid representation of outcomes from the community organizing intervention.  Methodological and statistical considerations for using concept mapping are mentioned.  The study concludes that concept mapping is a promising tool for theory articulation.  Study limitations and opportunities for future research are also discussed.

T1  - College students' GIS spatial concept knowledge assessed by concept maps
AN  - 885225634
AB  - The development of spatial thinking proficiency has been increasingly demanded in Geographic Information System (GIS) education. Despite this educational trend, there is little empirical research on college students‘ spatial concept knowledge, which critically affects the quality of spatial thinking. This study addressed the following three research questions: 1) What differences exist between students‘ understandings of spatial concepts at the beginning, middle, and end of an introductory-level GIS course?, 2) What spatial misconceptions students may possess while taking an introductory-level GIS course?, and 3) Which spatial concepts are easy or hard for undergraduate students to understand? The researcher asked twelve participants who were taking an introductory-level GIS course to create concept maps about space and revised their concept maps in three experiment sessions. For the first question, the researcher scored the sixty obtained concept maps and statistically analyzed those scores to examine if there is any significant difference among the scores of the three experiment sessions. For the second question, the researcher examined participants‘ misconceptions by analyzing the incorrect statements of distortion, map projection, and scale. For the third question, the researcher statistically analyzed concept-based scores to examine if there is any significant difference among the scores of three different complexity levels.   A main finding for the first question was that there was a significant difference among the scores of the concept maps created in the first session and the scores of the concept maps revised in the second and third sessions. This implied that participants could successfully revise their own original concept maps in the middle of a semester. The result of the study of the second question indicated that a half of participants misunderstood the concepts of map projections and scale. This result suggested that some undergraduate students may have difficulty shifting from scientifically inappropriate spatial concept knowledge to appropriate knowledge. Analysis of the third question resulted that the concept-based scores of simple spatial concepts are significantly higher than the scores of complicated spatial concepts. This result inferred that participants‘ scores decreased as the complexity of concepts increased.

T1  - The effects of three concept mapping strategies on seventh-grade students' science achievement at an urban middle school
AN  - 883387101
AB  - There is great concern over students' poor science achievement in the United States. Due to the lack of science achievement, students are not pursing science related careers resulting in an increase in outsourcing to other countries. Learning strategies such as concept mapping may ameliorate this situation by providing students with tools that encourage meaningful learning. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to measure the effects of three concept mapping learning strategies (concept identifying, proposition identifying, student generated) on urban middle school students' understanding of the circulatory system. Three intact classes of seventh-grade students were assigned to one of the three concept mapping strategies. The students were given a pretest on the circulatory system then learned and used their respective concept mapping strategies while learning about the circulatory system. At the conclusion of the study, students' science achievement was measured by performance on an achievement test and rubric scores of their respective concept identifying, proposition identifying, and student generated concept maps. The results of the study suggest that all three of the concept mapping strategies are effective in increasing students' science achievement. Additionally, the moderate significant correlations between the posttest and concept map scores of the current study established that concept maps are a useful measure of student knowledge. Lastly, the results of the current study also suggest that the concept identifying mapping strategy may be a useful scaffold in instructing students how to develop student generated concept maps.

T1  - Stories and cultural humility: Exploring power and privilege through physical therapist life histories
AN  - 873443800
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how life experiences, set within their social, cultural, and historical contexts, shape the development of cultural humility in physical therapists (PTs). Cultural humility involves health professionals being actively engaged in an ongoing process with patients, colleagues, communities, and themselves to make sense of the complexities of social and culture differences within relationships in practice. Given demographic trends and health care disparities, it has become critically important to better understand the dynamics of developing trusting relationships to provide quality care.    This study was influenced by relationship-centered care, sociocultural, and insurgent multiculturalism theories. A qualitative, life history study was designed to answer four major research questions: (1) What types of life experiences do PTs perceive frame the way they address cultural differences and build relationships? (2) What contextual influences do PTs perceive have facilitated or constrained their development of cultural humility? (3) How do PTs’ life histories elucidate how they attend to or resist facing issues of privilege and power in relationships? (4) What are the implications that attention to one’s own culture, privileges, and biases from a life history perspective hold for health professional curricular and pedagogical choices? Eight PTs participated in this study. The primary research method used was one-onone semi-structured interviews. Data were coded and analyzed for themes through constant comparison and constructing concept maps.    Five major themes centered on the development of cultural humility and building trusting relationships could be traced through the life histories: (1) being open-minded and listening attentively as patients tell their stories; (2) responding to a person’s emotions matters; (3) focusing care around a patient’s goals and needs; (4) teaching to engage and empower; and (5) evolving awareness of community needs and assets. Taking into account how participants used their life stories to make experiences and contextual influences meaningful, this study offers a framework for educators who are interested in using narratives to foster professional development. By virtue of ongoing reflection on practice and ones biography, including ones privilege, health professionals can be habitually engaged to action to build trusting relationships across difference.

T1  - Black Students and Mathematics Achievement: A Mixed-Method Analysis of In-School and Out-of-School Factors Shaping Student Success
AN  - 865880034
AB  - Achievement gap language has become associated with the observed disparities on a number of educational measures between the academic performances of Black and White students. This theoretical lens is problematic because it sends an unintended message that Black students are not worthy of study in their own right. Using a mixed-methodological approach, this study aimed to respond to the call of math educator Gutierrez (2008) who urges education researchers to "move away from gap gazing and toward more contextualized and intervention studies" (p. 362). Chapter 2 offers a socio-historical perspective to illuminate the evidence of Blacks' limited access both to mathematics as a discipline of study and a career path. A gap in the literature on the history of math education of Blacks exists, thus Tolley's (2003) seminal study on the factors that influenced the study of math and science for European girls (1840s to 1950s) is used to generate hypotheses about what factors might contribute or inhibit math participation and achievement of Blacks. Chapter 3 identifies four contemporary factors and closes with a concept map combining all eight factors. Along with the historical analysis, 69 student surveys and 12 in-depth interviews provided robust data that revealed an additional four factors—personality style, teacher- student relationships, motivation, and human agency. This study defined success broadly to include not only test scores, but persistence, course-taking patterns, fulfilling college admission requirements, and positive math identities. A mathematical model is put forth as a different way to think about math achievement for Black students schooled in the U.S. The model helps us to understand that Black students' math achievement can be viewed as a summation of a group of factors that are a part of what I call a micro and macro socio- historical background.

T1  - Concept Mapping and the Science Achievement of Third Grade Students
AN  - 864830890
AB  - Instructional strategies in science that fail to identify students’ initial understanding of scientific concepts may leave students’ flawed ideas unchanged, thus affecting their ability to synthesize, differentiate, and connect to new information in science. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between concept mapping and science achievement. Cognitive learning theories formed the theoretical framework for the study. The research questions addressed in this study examined whether a significant difference exists between the concept mapping (treatment) and the traditional (control) groups on posttest scores and on test scores across time and group. A one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine if there was a significant difference on posttest scores from 70 third grade students after controlling for pretest scores. Results of the ANCOVA analysis revealed the homogeneity of regression slopes assumption was not met. A two way repeated measures mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if there were differences on participants’ test scores by time and group. A statistically significant effect was found within subjects’ main effect across time and between subjects main effect by group. These findings provide a direction for facilitating social change by recognizing conceptual structures that enable students to distinguish the interrelatedness between new and existing knowledge for learning, suggesting implications for effecting achievement in school and in the workplace. This research is significant to educators, administrators, and parents in providing an understanding of concept mapping and the effect on cognitive learning.

T1  - Librarians' Leadership for Lifelong Learning
AN  - 848952738
AB  - In the context of a quality initiative to improve organizational performance, action research was conducted through a library program called Delaware Library Learning Journeys held in libraries and other venues throughout the state of Delaware from 2007 to 2010.  A total of 685 voluntary, self-selected participants in 48 Learning Journeys sessions provided evidence of the phenomenon of self-directed lifelong learning through surveys and discussions of individual interests and personal methods for tracking reading and learning.  Lifelong learning organizers were developed and tested.  The resulting Executive Position Paper includes a lifewide learning concept map from the review of the literature; the Delaware Library Quality Cycle integrates the four learning realms; and recommendations provide guidance for library leaders in developing policies and systematic proactive approaches to services for lifelong learners.

T1  - The Professional Practice Leader: The Role of Organizational Power and Personal Influence in Creating a Professional Practice Environment for Nurses
AN  - 2701128169
AB  - Professional Practice Leadership (PPL) roles were introduced in response to health care professionals’ concerns about the loss of professional autonomy and other possible negative consequences on professional practice arising out of the widespread implementation of program management during health care restructuring. Despite the extensive implementation of the PPL role in Ontario, there is a paucity of empirical studies examining the impact of the PPL role. The main purpose of this study was to address this knowledge gap by determining the role of organizational power and personal influence in enabling the PPL to fulfill their role functions toward creating a positive professional practice environment for nurses. The study tests a theoretically based model that integrates PPL perceptions of manager support and organizational power with their own influence tactics to predict the achievement of PPL role functions and the impact these functions could have on nurses’ perceptions of the professional practice environment.   This dissertation is comprised of four main components: 1) a review of the literature describing professional practice; 2) the application of a theoretical framework to describe the PPL role; 3) the development of an instrument to enable measurement of the PPL role; and 4) the empirical testing of a conceptual model depicting the proposed relationship of the PPL role and nurses practice environments. Based on path analysis with the hypothesized model, organizational power had a direct and positive effect on PPL role functions and PPL influence. Although PPL influence had a direct and positive impact on PPL role function the proposed mediated effect of organizational power on PPL role function was not supported nor was the hypothesized moderated effect of manager support on PPL role function. Finally, there was a small but statistically significant, positive relationship between PPL role function and aggregated nurse perceptions of the practice environment.    As this was the first known research study specific to the Nursing PPL role in Ontario, the evidence generated from this study can be used to inform current practices regarding the design, implementation and evaluation of the PPL role as well as future research regarding the impact of professional practice leadership roles on staff, organizational and patient outcomes.

T1  - The Effect of In-School Opera Performance and Related Curriculum on Music Cognition and Attitude
AN  - 2675225070
AB  - This study was designed to compare knowledge about and attitude toward opera in three groups of fifth-graders with various levels of involvement with an in-school opera. One group watched the live performance, a second group watched the performance preceded by three pre-performance lessons that encompassed common opera vocabulary and voice types, and a third group experienced the lessons, the performance, and a five-lesson creative project in which they constructed their own opera. All students completed cognitive and attitude pretests and post-tests. ANCOVA analyses accounted for differences in scores on the pretests. Significant differences (p < .05) on the multiple-choice portion of the cognitive exam were found between the performance-only group and the performance plus instruction groups. Significant differences were found between the groups on the concept map portion of the cognitive measure, with the differences coming between the performance only group and the performance plus lessons group. Significant differences were found between each of the groups for a Likert-scale attitude measure, with the performance and lessons group posting the largest increases. In addition, a significant correlation was found between cognitive scores and attitude scores. Responses to semi-structured interviews suggested that students’ opinions of Opera were influenced by factors related to music, factors related to production, and factors related to personal perceptions.

T1  - Academic Discourses and the Twenty First Century Context: Empowering All Students with Comprehension and Critical Engagement
AN  - 2616577489
AB  - Current economic, social, educational, and philosophical conditions of university learning in the 21st century are unique, resulting in a disjuncture between traditional academic discourse and the culture, literacy and the learning modes of current students. Driven by the knowledge economy and technology, governments have encouraged the massification and globalisation of university education and continue to promote access to university for non-traditional students. In regional, post-Dawkins universities of Australia, the student demographic is increasingly diverse, spanning age groups from 18-75, cultures, socio economic and educational backgrounds and English language proficiency. Evidence suggests that high levels of abstract and technical language exclude many students from academic discourse communities denying them an opportunity to succeed, affect performance and increase drop-out rates. In neglecting to provide specific strategies for ensuring all students have access to meanings in discourses, current theories for higher learning inadvertently fail to recognise that ‘knowledge’ is constructed through language. Further, university pedagogies continue to assume high levels of literacy previously associated with traditional university students.This thesis integrates learning theory and systemic functional language analysis to provide an understanding of, (1) how we use language to express abstract technical knowledge in the humanities, social science and science, and (2) what learning theory tells us about how we might best recruit students into academic discourse communities. To help establish the most effective ways of presenting discourse to first year students, it also compares three versions of discourse presenting the same knowledge and students’ views on how easy the discourse was to comprehend.Contemporary university language and learning theory, the linguistic features of academic discourses, and students’ responses to these are examined. This analysis informs a proposal for an inclusive pedagogy, effective in the apprenticing of students to become successful participants in academia, and the new knowledge world in general. These strategies build on the “Reading to Learn” scaffolding literacy approach of Rose (2007) by incorporating more explicitly, stages that acknowledge the importance of schema, concept mapping and experiential learning and our understanding of proclivities of the net generation.

T1  - Gaining insight into educators' understanding of digital technologies: three models for the analysis of multi-dimensional concept maps
AN  - 2119943315
AB  - The thesis explores the hypothesis that an analysis of a Multi-dimensional Concept Map (MDCM) provides educators and researchers with different and possibly richer and broader insights into understanding of an issue — in this case that of digital technologies in education - than written responses alone. 'Multi-dimensionality' refers to the characteristics of multimodal hand-drawn or digitally produced concept maps, namely multi-layering and (remote) multi-authoring. Forty-eight pairs of concept maps were collected, in three case studies based in England and South Africa, all focusing on gaining insights into educators' understanding of the use of digital technologies in teaching and learning. The three groups of educators were undertaking one-year courses about using computers in classrooms, underpinned by three different perspectives on learning. information transmission, constructivism and social interaction. This study of pre- and post-course concept maps aims to answer the Research Question: How does multimodal concept mapping provide insights into educators' understanding about digital technologies? Both benefits and challenges were evident in the use of the three different methods of analysis that were used. Given the relatively low numbers, a qualitative analysis of scores is revealing whereas a quantitative analysis is unreliable; 'words', where they are used, provide a useful insight; a more encompassing semiotic analysis revealed some underlying 'positions' that surprised even the map makers themselves. A key methodological finding was that in social interaction contexts, concept maps are most valuable used as scaffolds for conversations between participants within `communities of practice' to promote shared insights into professional understanding of digital technologies. The findings were influenced by the four different roles assumed by the researcher: as an objective judge of data; as a community mentor; as an active community member; and as a researcher and community member inviting other members of that community to be co-researchers. The researcher learnt, as the project progressed, that the danger of becoming too close to the 'subjects' to be objective about the data was outweighed by the richness of the insights when the map makers engaged with the researcher and with trusted colleagues in analyzing the meaning of their pairs of concept maps.

T1  - A Concept Mapping Needs Assessment of Young Families with Parental Cancer
AN  - 2027412266
AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the support needs of young families living with and beyond a parental diagnosis of cancer. The sample includes 56 participants comprised of 31 professional stakeholders and 25 patient stakeholders affiliated with the Charles R. Wood Cancer Center. It was hypothesized there would be differences in how the groups of stakeholders rated needs in terms of importance, satisfaction, and utilization. Differences in ratings are thought to be barriers to effective program development. While not a formal research hypothesis, it was anticipated other program development barriers germane to naturalistic clinical settings would emerge from the organizational, community, practitioner, and researcher domains. By utilizing an internet-based method of needs assessment known as Concept Mapping, the researcher facilitated discovering 125 emergent patient and family needs. An eight-cluster model of identified issues and needs was constructed. The cluster names assigned include Emotional Impact on Parents, Parents' Worries About Children, Family Adaptation to Illness, Navigation, Case Management, Emotional Impact on Children, Kids' Support Needs, and Families' Support Needs. Results indicate differences in how the patient and professional stakeholders rate the statements on all levels, indicating potential barriers to effective program development. The cluster rated lowest on satisfaction and highest on level of importance and utilization is Case Management, indicating a need for initial and on-going psychosocial needs assessment throughout the experience of a parental diagnosis of cancer. Limitations for this study are discussed in addition to recommendations for oncology support program development at the Charles R. Wood Cancer Center.

T1  - Teaching english literature for the g.c.e 'o' level in sri lanka: a study of teacher professional knowledge
AN  - 1779949061
AB  - This study investigates the knowledge base of teachers of English literature in the secondary school context of Sri Lanka. This is a discipline which has been subject to many changes in educational policy and has in fact mirrored the changing status of English in Sri Lanka. This research utilizes the concept of PCK (pedagogical content knowledge) developed by Shulman (1987) as the overall organizing theoretical framework to explore the professional knowledge base of the teachers of English literature. Many definitions have been put forward regarding the precise composition of PCK but this study focuses on the following concepts delineated by Magnusson, Borko and Krajcik (1999): orientation to the subject, knowledge of student difficulties, knowledge of the curriculum and knowledge of instructional strategies. The four participants in the study were primarily language teachers who had subsequently ventured into the field of teaching literature. They had been teaching literature for many years but were essentially teaching outside their area of expertise. A qualitative approach was adopted and data was gathered from interviews, classroom observations and concept maps. The data was analyzed based on categories arising from the theoretical framework. Case studies were developed that provided profiles of PCK of four teachers: Geetha, Nelum, Malini and Anita. The analysis of data revealed that the four participants held different orientations to the teaching of the subject but that they all essentially adopted a text centered approach which concentrated on anlaysing the literary elements of the texts chosen for study. Inadequacies could be seen in several components of PCK. All four participants were unable to diagnose subject specific difficulties that students faced and were also unable to implement subject specific instructional strategies. Many of these issues could be linked to the inadequacies of these teachers' subject matter knowledge as well as the limitations imposed by the context in which they were teaching. The study points to the need to develop and implement new avenues of professional development to enhance the Pedagogical Content Knowledge of teachers of English literature in the Sri Lankan context.

T1  - Leadership and multicultural education: an analysis of multicultural leadership practice in a cypriot primary school
AN  - 1779233380
AB  - This study set out to gain an understanding of the leadership practice in response to the multicultural orientation of education due to the increasingly multicultural environment of schools in Cyprus. The research aimed to analyse the complexity of leadership and ME by investigating the different school stakeholders' roles in and contribution to the leadership behaviour and practice of ME in a Cypriot primary school. Aiming to provide an in depth and rounded view of the beliefs, and behaviours of the different stakeholders that may affect the processes of leadership practice for ME, the study adopted a qualitative, case study design. Purposive sampling and criterion-based selection were used to select a primary school and to identify stakeholders within that school to participate in the study. The participants were the headteacher, teachers, parents, students and inspector of the school. The main research instrument employed as the semi-structured interview. Other data collection methods included observation, concept map, conversation, documents and open questionnaire. Data were analysed using thematic analysis by employing themes and codes both preconceived as well as grounded in the data. The study used Bronfenbrenner's (1979) ecological model as a conceptual framework to analyse the evidence and examine the research aims. The findings reveal the complexity of multicultural leadership practice and the influence of the different school stakeholders' beliefs and behaviour. Furthermore, the research findings highlight the importance of a moral, democratic and distributed discourse of leadership in response to multiculturalism,: accompanied by forms of transformational and instructional leadership. Another outcome is that the practice of multi cultural leadership is affected by the ecological system of the school in various ways. Finally, some behaviours and characteristics (conceptualizations of ME, multicultural competence, celebrating diversity, parental and communal involvement, state support, school culture, relationships, curriculum, collaboration, experience and personal qualities, school's support system) are presented as those that may enable or disable multicultural leadership practice in the school in numerous different ways. The findings discussed in this report provide important data that could be interesting for researchers and professionals in the field of educational leadership, multi cultural education and school policy. These concern school stakeholders (teachers, headteachers, students, parents, governors and inspectors), policy makers and providers of leadership professional development programmes.

T1  - Decision-making processes of weaning from mechanical ventilation: a comparative ethnographic insight into the dynamics of the decision-making environment
AN  - 1221966183
AB  - Many critical clinical conditions result in respiratory failure and precipitate the use of mechanical ventilation for their management. A prolonged period of mechanical ventilation is costly for both the patient, in terms of adverse effects, and the health care service. Therefore, immediate liberation of the patient from mechanical ventilation and constitution of spontaneous breathing, a process called weaning, is vital. This daily lifesaving practice, on which nurses are taking an increasing role with the introduction of nurse-led protocols, can become complicated requiring the effective use of assessment information through decision-making processes to improve outcomes of care. Most literature on the field fails to address that weaning decisions are affected not only by the nature of the task but also by the characteristics of the decision-maker and the decision environment. This research aimed to study nurses' decision-making processes when managing the weaning of long-term ventilated patients and to explore the impact of the diverse elements of the clinical environment on this intricate practice. An ethnographic approach was used to compare weaning decision-making processes in two different culturally intensive care units (ICU). Participant observation was used to follow the weaning practices of 10 patients in a Scottish ICU and 9 patients in a Greek ICU admitted with respiratory failure due to pneumonia or COPD exacerbation. Nurses were observed in their daily weaning practice and participated in reflective interviews at the end of their shift to extrapolate how they used the information to make their decisions. Semi-structured interviews were, then, conducted with nurses, physiotherapists and medical staff to explore their perceptions on weaning practices and the factors that influenced their decisions and clinical practice. Data were analysed thematically and concept maps were developed from the reflective interviews to analyse nurses‟ decision-making processes. The concept attainment theory was used as a framework to understand nurses' thinking processes. Nurses in all ranges of experience demonstrated a similar decision-making skill, which signifies that this cognitive process is not always related to the level of experience and knowledge. Nurses' weaning care was organised around maintaining a balance of care under the 'wean as able' medical instruction. Inconsistency in the weaning decisions led to a variability of weaning approaches followed for each patient and to long periods of weaning inactivity. Various reasons, related to the working relationships, lack of nurses‟ accountability, lack of support and unstructured information flow, were responsible for the deficiency in sustainable and consistent weaning decisions. In both settings, there was lack of culture to foster a shared decision-making approach in weaning practice and encourage nurses' autonomy in decision-making. This study concluded with proposing a collaborative decision-making framework for weaning long-term ventilated patients, which will involve and appreciate the contribution of all members of the multidisciplinary team.

T1  - Physics simulations and their influence on conceptual change in students
AN  - 1220901370
AB  - This research was designed to determine what conceptual changes occur when students use computer simulations, and whether simulations with characteristics defined as engaging by Adams et al. (2008a; 2008b), Granlund, Berglund, and Eriksson (2000), Kali and Linn (2008), Kim, Yoon, Whang, Tversky, and Morrison (2007), Lowe (2004), Malone (1981), and Wishart (1990), seem to promote conceptual change. Six grade-ten students worked with three projectile-motion simulations in various orders. Students drew pre- and post-treatment concept maps, their interactions with the simulations were videotaped, and they were interviewed. The results show that the students did experience conceptual change, but the changes were mostly within existing cognitive frameworks with few higher-order connections made. As well, the simulation that engaged the students the most promoted the least conceptual change, and vice versa. These findings support recommendations made in earlier literature that raise awareness of simulation features that tend to distract students from learning goals.

T1  - Exploring the impact of configuration and mode of input on group dynamics in computing
AN  - 1124343188
AB  - Objectives: Large displays and new technologies for interacting with computers offer a rich area for the development of new tools to facilitate collaborative concept mapping activities. In this thesis, WiiConcept is described as a tool designed to allow the use of multiple WiiRemotes for the collaborative creation of concept maps, with and without gestures. Subsequent investigation of participants' use of the system considers the effect of single and multiple input streams when using the software with and without gestures and the impact upon group concept mapping process outcomes and interactions when using a large display. Methods: Data is presented from an exploratory study of twenty two students who have used the tool. Half of the pairs used two WiiRemotes, while the remainder used one WiiRemote. All pairs created one map without gestures and one map with gestures. Data about their maps, interactions and responses to the tool were collected. Results: Analysis of coded transcripts indicates that one-controller afforded higher levels of interaction, with the use of gestures also increasing the number of interactions seen. Additionally, the result indicated that there were significantly more interactions of the 'shows solidarity', 'gives orientation', and 'gives opinion' categories (defined by the Bales' interaction processes assessment), when using one-controller as opposed to two. Furthermore, there were more interactions for the 'shows solidarity', 'tension release', 'gives orientation' and 'shows tension' categories when using gestures as opposed to the non-use of gestures. Additionally, there were no significant differences in the perceived dominance of individuals, as measured on the social dominance scales, for the amount of interaction displayed, however, there was a significant main effect of group conversational control score on the 'gives orientation' construct, with a higher number of interactions for low, mixed and high scores of this type when dyads had one-controller as opposed to two-controllers. There was also a significant interaction effect of group conversational control score on the 'shows solidarity' construct with a higher number of interactions for all scores of this type when dyads had one-controller as opposed to two-controllers. The results also indicate that for the WiiConcept there was no difference between number of controllers in the detail in the maps, and that all users found the tool to be useful for the collaborative creation of concept maps. At the same time, engaging in disagreement was related to the amount of nodes created with disagreement leading to more nodes being created. Conclusions: Use of one-controller afforded higher levels of interaction, with gestures also increasing the number of interactions seen. If a particular type of interaction is associated with more nodes, there might also be some argument for only using one-controller with gestures enabled to promote cognitive conflict within groups. All participants responded that the tool was relatively easy to use and engaging, which suggests that this tool could be integrated into collaborative concept mapping activities, allowing for greater collaborative knowledge building and sharing of knowledge, due to the increased levels of interaction for one-controller. As research has shown concept mapping can be useful for promoting the understanding of complex ideas, therefore the adoption of the WiiConcept tool as part of a small group learning activity may lead to deeper levels of understanding. Additionally, the use of gestures suggests that this mode of input does not affect the amount of words, nodes, and edges created in a concept map. Further research, over a longer period of time, may see improvement with this form of interaction, with increased mastery of gestural movement leading to greater detail of conceptual mapping.

T1  - Towards a Framework to Support Engineering Design Student Projects
AN  - 1027847519
AB  - The first research question of this thesis addresses the problem of information management in engineering design projects. The students' design deliberations, as externalized in their discussion threads and through the documents they create or reference, can be visualized by mining the textual evidence they produce as natural part of their collaboration process. By using computational linguistic techniques and machine learning, all the documents and student discussion threads are aggregated, and a sample concept-map based graphical representation is created that can be used to navigate the project corpus. This approach is referred to as DesignWebs. DesignWebs can be viewed as an assemblage of related noun phrases reveal the current state of the project and the underlying structure of the design. DesignWebs assist as navigation aids in contextualizing and viewing project archives by structuring the design information as graphs of related entities.    The second research question presents noun phrases as a surrogate measure for design team dynamics. This question builds on prior research about using noun phrases as objective measure for measuring design team performance (Mabogunje 1997), and uses them for exploring how the design vocabulary of student teams expands and contracts during a design project. The expansion and contraction reflect the students brainstorming about different design alternatives for the project and finalizing certain design solutions respectively. This question also shows that tracking the noun phrases as they are introduced by one team and shared across team boundaries can reveal insights about whether the teams are successfully collaborating. Tracking the design vocabulary over time shows how the design vocabulary related to a team's assigned tasks keeps on getting refined as the project progresses, reflecting the domain expertise gained by the team. The shared vocabulary between teams also mirrors the project's work-flow, as it is represented in the artifact's system architecture diagram. Finally this question shows how instructors can see the changes in a team's design knowledge by monitoring its DesignWebs, as they are created at different milestones during the project. The third research question presents DesignWebs as a research framework that facilitates the validation of prior research findings about the functioning and assessment of design project teams by obviating the tedious data pre-processing steps. Three diverse research studies are examined to demonstrate the wide applicability of DesignWebs as a platform: the first examines whether using the semantic coherence of student communications in team-based project courses can act as an indicator of the progress of the design process (Song et al. 2003); the second examines whether applying metrics on the "communication artifacts" generated by computer supported collaborative tools can provide insights into the design process that created them (Dutoit 1996); the third explores various individual and group work processes that when made more explicit to instructors can assist them in carrying out the assessment processes (Gweon 2008).    This research contributes to supporting engineering design student projects by presenting a framework that organizes and evaluates a variety of potential metrics and design assessment measures based on the text products in a given project corpus. It also presents an interface that summarizes the team's online communications and documentation to track the emergence of the shared solution and extent of team collaboration, using noun phrases as a surrogate measure. Finally, this research presents a research test bed that brings together a number of research hypotheses related to collaborative design projects by demonstrating that they can complement the instructors' understanding of how teams are working.

T1  - The use of inspiration as a multimedia plenary activity for improving the cognitive assimilation of Biology 12 students
AN  - 1026810750
AB  - Unit plenary activities are review activities used at the end of an educational unit. This thesis examined the effects of using Inspiration, a concept mapping computer program, as a plenary activity on summative assessment scores, compared the effectiveness of Inspiration to Review Worksheets/Discussion, explored the effects of Inspiration on Understanding, Knowledge and Higher Order Process, examined time on-task behaviours and plenary completion rates, and examined student perception of the effectiveness of Inspiration as a plenary with two classes of Biology 12 students. An action research methodology was applied to collect data from two senior classes. Quantitative data was collected using pre-/post-test results, time on-task behaviour, and assignment completion. Qualitative data was collected to identify student perception of the plenary and student study habits. The findings indicate that Inspiration statistically significantly improved summative scores, Understanding, Knowledge, time on-task behaviours, and plenary completion rates. The Inspiration and Review Worksheet/Discussion plenary activities were not statistically different in improving summative scores.

T1  - An interpretive study of African Americans' mental models of museums and visitation: “…you think, damn, so close, but yet so far.”
AN  - 915016959
AB  - Given the absence of racially inclusive museum visitation studies, the challenge for museum and adult learning researchers is to better understand African Americans' mental models of museums and how these mental models influence visitation decisions. The conceptual framework for my study was constructed from three diverse, yet complimentary fields of research. First, research on mental models provided a basis for understanding the impact that mental models can have on decisions to participate in learning opportunities, like those offered in museums. Second, Knowles' (1980) concept of andragogy provided an understanding of how characteristics of adult learners' and the learning context may further influence visitors' conceptions of museums and visitation decisions. And lastly, Critical Race Theory (CRT) allowed me to examine how museum philosophies, policies, and practices have influenced African Americans' mental models and visitation of museums. Two research questions guided the study: 1) What are African Americans' mental models of museums?; and 2) In what ways do African Americans' mental models of museums influence their visitation?    The study utilized an interpretative qualitative design (Merriam & Associates, 2002), which, "...seek[s] to discover and understand a phenomenon, a process or the perspectives and worldviews of the people involved" (Merriam, 1998, p. 11). The sample was purposeful and representatively selected and comprised 8 African Americans. Data 11 were collected via three methods: modified Twenty Statements Tests (Kuhn & McParland, 1954), semi-structured interviews, and concept mapping. Data were inductively analyzed using a constant-comparative method and revealed four themes: (a) museums are conceived as, and visited because they are worthwhile places of learning; (b) museums are visited because they provide an escape from socio-cultural pressures; (c) museums are conceived as offering narrow representations of African Americans that perpetuate African American stereotypes; and (d) museums are conceived of at times as not wanting and not accepting African American visitors. By eliciting African Americans' mental models, instead of relying on anecdotal evidence, museums will have a more accurate understanding of African American "edutainment" needs and wants, with which to develop future exhibitions and programming.

T1  - A Longitudinal Investigation into the Association of Smoking and Depression Among Adolescents: Exposures, Outcomes, and Auxiliary Hypotheses
AN  - 870508612
AB  - Introduction: The association between smoking and depression has been well established, but the nature of the relationship has not been determined. A synthesis of longitudinal studies examining the onset of smoking and depression among adolescents demonstrated consistent evidence of both smoking predicting depression and depression predicting smoking in multiple populations; however, more work is needed to develop and test the mechanisms associated with the onset of the co-occurrence of smoking and depression. This thesis examines the role of a broad range of potential confounders on the relationship between smoking and depression, and investigates a potential mechanism of effect.    Method: Analyses were conducted using the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) cohort which included 1293 students initially aged 12-13 years recruited from all grade seven classes in a convenience sample of ten secondary schools in Montreal, Canada surveyed twenty times over five years. Multiple regressions were performed to examine the temporal relationship of potential confounders on the relationship between smoking and depression and to empirically observe variables that could be intermediate on pathways between smoking and depression. A growth curve model was developed to test the effect of perceived self medication on changes in depression scores over time.    Results: A concept map of the smoking and depression relationship in the NDIT cohort was developed according to the results of proportional hazard and fixed effect regressions in which friend smoking, stress, and anxiety-associated variables were identified as intermediate variables. Perceived self-medication was associated with decelerated rates of change of depressive symptoms over times, suggesting that smoking may increase mean levels of stress and depressive symptoms, but may offer the perception of control.    Conclusion: In concert, this thesis suggests a model in which stress and the perceived control of psychobiological function using cigarettes lead to the development of increased depressive symptoms and increased cigarette use.

T1  - Success in virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams in industry
AN  - 867372084
AB  - In today’s fast-paced and innovation-driven world, the nature of the design problems facing industry often requires the use of cross-disciplinary teams in order to maximize innovation. Assembling face-to-face teams to solve the wide variety of design problems that exist is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible, leaving companies with no choice but to call upon virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams to quickly and cost-effectively solve design problems. These teams are crucial to competitiveness in the future, but virtual team members need a stronger set of skills in order for virtual teams to be successful.   This study answers the research question: What factors contribute to the success of virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams in industry? Three case studies were conducted on three distinctly different pre-existing virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams in industry. One team was designing a process for working virtually, the second was redesigning an existing product to reduce cost, and the third was working as a part of a customer-led virtual team to design a brand new product. Team members completed questionnaires, participated in interviews, and went through observations of their virtual work experiences over a period of six weeks for each team, and a multi-case study analysis was conducted.    The results of this study showed that factors that contribute to the success of virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams fall into three major categories: the context in which teams work, the method by which teams do their work, and the  media by which teams communicate. This study’s framework provides a platform for future research on virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams, both in industry and in education. This study also found that virtual teams need (1) strong processes, (2) high-quality team members, and (3) higher performance in general on team success factors, suggesting that processes may be more important than technology.

T1  - Concept mapping as a teaching strategy on knowledge of community/public health nursing among accelerated baccalaureate nursing students
AN  - 860954196
AB  - The purpose of this research study was to determine the difference in students' knowledge acquisition in Community/Public Health Nursing when taught by lecture only versus lecture plus concept mapping. To determine this difference, student scores on the Community Health Nurse HESI exam were compared. During the study, a quasi- experimental, pre-test/post-test design was used, and the participants were randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group. Demographic characteristics of students were analyzed to determine whether these characteristics were covariates with student scores. In addition, sub-scores on content areas of the test were examined to identify overall topic/content strengths, weaknesses and significant areas of difference.    Data analysis using ANCOVA on mean improvement of student scores resulted in no significant difference between the groups at .05. However, results were significant at .10. The mean improvement in scores for the lecture plus concept mapping group was three times greater than that of the lecture only group. Significantly different sub-content areas included: Communication, Technical Skills, Global Health Care Systems, Risk Reduction, Human Diversity, and Manager of Care.    This study provides a focus on quantitative measurement, as well as evidence on the effectiveness of particular teaching strategies. The generation of data on student outcomes provided by this study may assist nurse educators in planning curriculum, while meeting the changing demands in health care.

T1  - The multiple-choice concept map (MCCM): An interactive computer-based assessment method
AN  - 857921624
AB  - This research attempted to bridge the gap between cognitive psychology and educational measurement (Mislevy, 2008; Leighton & Gierl, 2007; Nichols, 1994; Messick, 1989; Snow & Lohman, 1989) by using cognitive theories from working memory (Baddeley, 1986; Miyake & Shah, 1999; Grimley & Banner, 2008), multimedia learning (Mayer, 2001), and cognitive load (Chandler and Sweller, 1991, 1992; Cerpa, Chandler, & Sweller, 1996) to identify potential design weaknesses of traditional select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map assessment and then to guide the design of the new and improved multiple-choice concept map (MCCM) assessment method.    The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of (1) the type of the list of concepts or relations and (2) the spatial placement of the selection list on the examinee’s overall mental effort. Using a 2x2 Factorial MANCOVA, with prior knowledge as the covariate, the participants were compared on the length of time to complete the assessment and on examinee’s rating of personal mental effort exerted during the assessment. A Simple Planned Comparison was conducted to evaluate estimated mean differences between the primary group of interest (MCCM-integrated Group 4) and each of the other three groups. Of additional interest were differences among the four different groups on the examinees’ attitudes and impressions toward their respective assessment method; these data provided more insight into the quality of design for each treatment group.    The type of List/Map had a significant main effect on the overall mental effort/strain or the linear combination of time on task and mental effort rating scores. More specifically, however, the test of between-subjects effects indicated that the type of list/map had a statistically significant effect on the time to complete the assessment, but not on the examinees’ mental effort ratings. In other words, participants who received the MCCM assessments (which used the MCL) completed the assessment task significantly faster but did not rate higher or lower on personal mental effort than the participants who received the traditional SAFI concept map assessments.    The spatial placement of the selection list (integrated and non-integrated) did not have a statistically significant main effect on the linear combination of time on task and mental effort rating scores. The test of between-subjects effects indicated that the spatial placement of the selection list (integrated versus non-integrated) did not have a statistically significant effect on the time to complete the assessment or on the examinees’ exerted mental effort. In other words, participants who received who received the integrated lists did not complete the assessment task faster and did not rate themselves lower on personal mental effort than the participants who received non-integrated selection list.    The estimated mean time on task of the primary group of interest (MCCM-integrated Group 4) was significantly shorter than that of both SAFI groups (integrated and non-integrated), but was not significantly shorter when compared to the time on task of the MCCM-non-integrated Group 3. There were no significant differences on mental effort ratings between MCCM-integrated Group 4 and either of the other three groups.    The participant responses to the Attitudes and Impressions Questionnaire indicated a general preference for the MCCM over the more traditional SAFI map and, in some cases, a slight preference of MCCM-integrated over MCCM-non-integrated.    The multiple-choice concept map (MCCM) is a new interactive computer-based assessment method that bridges well-documented research findings from cognitive science and psychometrics and has the potential to be an external knowledge representation with much-desired characteristics of being valid, efficient, and explicit (Mislevy, Behrens, Bennett, DeMark, Frezzo, Levy, Robinson, Rutstein, Stanley, Winters, & Shute, 2007) when assessing students’ knowledge structures or schema-based knowledge (Pellegrino, Chudowsky, & Glasser, editors, 2001; NAEP, 2008).

T1  - A Longitudinal Examination of Middle School Science Learners' Use of Scaffolding In and Around a Dynamic Modeling Tool
AN  - 849314325
AB  - Scaffolding is a term rooted in multiple research communities over decades of development. Customized, contingent support can be provided to learners to enable performances beyond what they can do alone. This dissertation seeks to examine how effectively scaffolds designed to promote articulation (written expressions of learner understanding) actually work, and if this effectiveness and/or the quality of the resulting models changes over time. It longitudinally examines the use of scaffolds designed into a dynamic modeling tool, as it is used by middle school science learners to create, test, and revise models of complex science phenomena like stream ecosystems. This dissertation also reviews the origins of the scaffolding construct, and summarizes conceptions of scaffolding from various lines of research. Scaffolding can be provided by both human and non-human agents, such as computers, which require specialized interface design to ensure maximum effectiveness.    In the study, learners created models in four curriculum units over the seventh and eighth grade school years. Additionally, this dissertation examines the nature of the discussion learners have while using these scaffolds and the frequency and types of interpersonal scaffolds employed during the creation of models. Model quality is also examined using a rubric developed through review of prior research on assessing models and concept maps. Learner pairs' model creation sessions on a computer are captured with screen video and learner audio, and then distilled to transcripts for subsequent coding and analysis, supported by qualitative analysis software.   Articulation scaffolds were found to succeed in promoting articulations and the quality of those articulations improved over time. Learner dialog associated with these written articulations is of reasonable quality but did not improve over time. Quality of model artifacts did improve over time. The overall use of scaffolding by each learner pair was contrasted with that pairs model quality, but no relationship was found.   Software design and classroom implementation implications of these findings are discussed. The frequency of interpersonal scaffolding provided by teachers highlights the need to consider scaffolding holistically and synergistically, with design decisions for software tools made in light of careful analysis as to what human and non-human agents can and should each provide.

T1  - Concept mapping: An intervention conducted to improve clinical skills for radiologic technology students
AN  - 840542115
AB  - Radiologic technology programs prepare students whose goal it is to be an X-ray technologist. X-ray technologists perform exams such as routine X-rays, computerized axial tomography, magnetic resonance, and mammography. The student technologist learns body part positioning, anatomy and physiology, radio-physics, and radiation protection. In addition to radiation protection, patient care and education is the most important subject the X-ray tech studies. Performing these exams aids doctors in patient diagnosis and treatment. Radiologic technologists are important members of the health care community and require educational programs to maintain the highest possible teaching and learning standards. All programs must be regionally or programmatically accredited. There are many different types of programs; however, most components are similar. There are didactic, laboratory, and clinical components. Students attend class, practice in a lab or X-ray room, and perform patient exams in a radiology department. At the conclusion of the X-ray program, students sit for a national registry governed by the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists in order to work as an X-ray tech. Due to accreditation standards, all X-ray programs must meet certain goals and objectives. To take the registry and pass, students must achieve a score of 75%. Radiology instructors are always looking for teaching techniques that will allow the program to improve the registry scores. Four instructors and 48 students were invited to participate in a research study incorporating concept mapping in the laboratory portion of an X-ray program. The experimental design divided the group of students into an experimental group and a control group. The variable was the students' GPAs. The study spanned 10 weeks and followed the previously established curriculum. The experimental group received instruction on how to construct concept maps and received class time to perform this assignment. The purpose of introducing concept mapping into the classroom was to improve critical-thinking and problem-solving skills that suggest meaningful learning has occurred. The conceptual framework for this study was an expansion of Ausubel's learning theory (The Psychology of Meaningful Verbal Learning, 1963) by Novak and Gowin (Learning How to Learn, 2008). At the study's conclusion, the students' GPAs showed no significant improvements; however, several unexpected findings emerged.

T1  - Nature or Nurture? A Characterization of the Knowledge and Practices of In- and Out-of-field Beginning Secondary Physics Teachers
AN  - 822779267
AB  - Previous studies have shown that adequate content knowledge is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for affective teaching. While legislation requests teachers to be "highly qualified" in a subject area, such as physics, many teachers are frequently asked to teach in an area when they are not certified through a teaching license to do so. This study uses mixed methods to examine the knowledge of beginning physics teachers. Through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and concept maps, the pedagogical content knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and practices of three groups of beginning secondary physics teachers were explored. Data were analyzed qualitatively using cases and quantitatively using descriptive statistics and t-tests, the results of which were combined during the interpretation phase of the research process. The study indicated that, over the first two years of teaching, the in-field group of teachers showed stronger physics content knowledge, a consideration for student difficulties with physics topics, and a positive shift in pedagogical content knowledge impacted by working with students, as compared to the rest of the teachers in the study. This research has implications in the development of secondary physics teachers and in the field of physics education research. Specifically, this research has implications in the physics content support for beginning secondary science teachers, the novice/expert research in physics education research, and the pedagogical preparation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty in physics.

T1  - A concept mapping case domain modeling approach for digital forensic investigations
AN  - 821240274
AB  - Over the decades, computer forensics has expanded from primarily examining computer evidence found on hard drives into the examination of digital devices with increasing storage capacity, to the identification of crimes and illegal activities involving the use of computers, to addressing standards and practices deficiencies, and to addressing the need to educate and train law enforcement, computer forensic technicians, and investigators.   This dissertation presents the concept mapping case domain modeling approach to aid examiners/investigators in searching and identifying digital evidence and analyzing the case domain during the examination and analysis phase of the computer forensic investigation. The examination and analysis phases of a computer forensic process are two of the most important phases of the investigative process because the search for and identification of evidence data is crucial to a case; any data uncovered will help determine the guilt or innocence of a suspect. In addition, these phases can become very time consuming and cumbersome. Therefore, finding a method to reduce the amount of time spent searching and identifying potential evidence and analyzing the case domain would greatly enhance the efficiency of the computer forensic process.   The hypothesis of this dissertation is that the concept mapping case domain modeling approach can serve as a method for organizing, examining, and analyzing digital forensic evidence and can enhance the quality of forensic examinations without increasing the time required to examine and analyze forensic evidence by more than 5%. Four experiments were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the concept mapping case domain modeling approach. Analysis of the experiments supports the hypothesis that the concept mapping case domain modeling approach can be used to organize, search, identify, and analyze digital evidence in an examination.

T1  - The development and use of a concept mapping assessment tool with young children on family visits to a live butterfly exhibit
AN  - 817394574
AB  - Although young children are major audiences of science museums, limited evidence exists documenting changes in children's knowledge in these settings due in part to the limited number of valid and reliable assessment tools available for use with this population. The purposes of this study were to develop and validate a concept mapping assessment tool and to use this tool to document the butterfly-related knowledge of young children on unguided family visits to a live butterfly exhibit at a natural history museum. In this study, forty-two children visited the live butterfly exhibit with their families on unguided tours and completed pre- and post-visit concept mapping tasks. During pre- and post-visit mapping sessions, children created and revised concept maps about butterflies using a set of eight butterfly-related concept pictures and provided verbal explanations for each picture pair in their concept maps.    Three raters used three different scoring systems designed for use in this study to evaluate the scientific accuracy of the children's pre- and post-visit maps, including the picture pairs and verbal explanations. Quantitative analyses of the scores indicate that the raters used the three scoring systems with a moderate to high level of consistency. The results also indicate that children significantly increased their butterfly-related knowledge in the live butterfly exhibit regardless of recent prior experience with the exhibit.    Qualitative analyses of children's verbal explanations indicate that children possessed butterfly-related knowledge related to: the needs of butterflies, the life cycle of butterflies, the ecology of butterflies and other insects, the diversity and classification of butterflies and other insects, the threats to and conservation of butterflies, and the social and maternal behavior of butterflies. Although children with different levels of exhibit experience showed similarly high levels of prior and subsequent knowledge, the types of understandings they communicated in their verbal explanations differed somewhat. Surprisingly, children without recent prior exhibit experience showed greater understanding in more areas of butterfly-related knowledge than children with recent prior exhibit experience. The results of this study have implications for the field of science education in general and the field of informal science education in particular.

T1  - Incorporating background knowledge in document clustering
AN  - 815440614
AB  - The explosive growth of unstructured text data in the present digital age has triggered an overwhelming interest in the development of robust and scalable document clustering techniques that can automatically partition and summarize the large tracts of documents. As document clustering is an unsupervised learning task, the quality of the partitions may be suboptimal due to the lack of guidance about which documents belong together in the same cluster. Augmenting the clustering algorithm with additional side information may potentially lead to better clusters. Towards this end, this thesis focuses on the use of background knowledge from an ontology such as WordNet to enhance the performance of document clustering algorithms. There are numerous challenges that must be overcome in order for such an approach to be successful. Most notably, how to effectively map the original words in the documents to their corresponding concepts in an ontology? The strategy used for concept mapping is important because it may increase the dimensionality of the data or introduce erroneous concepts, both of which have an adverse effect on the quality of the final partitions. In addition, the choice of ontology is another factor that should be taken into consideration since each ontology has its own structure, coverage, and content. Despite these challenges, a considerable amount of research has been done over the past decade on ontology-driven clustering. Yet the results from previous studies have not been conclusive. Some concluded that ontology helps improve clustering performance while others showed it is not that helpful. This thesis investigates the various factors that affect the performance of such clustering algorithms, including the choice of ontology, concept mapping approach, and benchmark datasets and baseline algorithms used for evaluation. The contributions of this thesis are as follows: First, a noun-based approach is proposed as a simple but more stringent baseline for clustering. Second, a novel unsupervised information gain approach is developed for extracting a core subset of semantic features from an ontology that can be effectively used for clustering. Third, a hybrid ontology-driven ensemble clustering method is proposed that combines the clusters of nouns and clusters of concepts extracted from an ontology. Finally, an approach for extracting concepts from Wikipedia is proposed and compared against existing works. These concepts are then used in conjunction with the concepts (synsets) from WordNet to study the effect of applying multiple ontologies on document clustering.

T1  - Estimating the reliability of concept map ratings using a scoring rubric based on three attributes of propositions
AN  - 807419142
AB  - Concept maps provide a way to assess how well students have developed an organized understanding of how the concepts taught in a unit are interrelated and fit together. However, concept maps are challenging to score because of the idiosyncratic ways in which students organize their knowledge (McClure, Sonak, & Suen, 1999).   The construct a map or C-mapping” task has been shown to capture students’ organized understanding. This “C-mapping” task involves giving students a list of concepts and asking them to produce a map showing how these concepts are interrelated. The purpose of this study was twofold: (a) to determine to what extent the use of the restricted C-mapping technique coupled with the threefold scoring rubric produced reliable ratings of students conceptual understanding from two examinations, and (b) to project how the reliability of the mean ratings for individual students would likely vary as a function of the average number of raters and rating occasions from two examinations.   Nearly three-fourths (73%) of the variability in the ratings for one exam and (43%) of the variability for the other exam were due to dependable differences in the students’ understanding detected by the raters. The rater inconsistencies were higher for one exam and somewhat lower for the other exam. The person-to-rater interaction was relatively small for one exam and somewhat higher for the other exam. The rater-by-occasion variance components were zero for both exams. The unexplained variance accounted for 19% on one exam and 14% on the other.   The size of the reliability coefficient of student concept map scores varied across the two examinations. A reliability of .95 and .93 for relative and absolute decision was obtained for one exam. A reliability of .88 and .78 for absolute and relative decision was obtained for the other exam. Increasing the number of raters from one to two on one rating occasion would yield a greater increase in the reliability of the ratings at a lower cost than increasing the number of rating occasions. The same pattern holds for both exams.   Keywords: concept maps, reliability, scoring rubric, rating concept maps propositions, Biology, connected understanding, assessment, psychometrics, concept map ratings.

T1  - Program theory in leadership development: A structured conceptualization exercise for the LEAD New York program
AN  - 748216295
AB  - A review of the literature on leadership development indicated a disconnect between the practice of leadership development and its theoretical underpinnings. Many leadership development programs (and practitioners) operate without an explicit program theory to guide their work, resulting in interventions that are often haphazard in their implementation. On the other hand, many contemporary leadership theories are not contextualized, their constructs are not adequately explicated, and they are not developed using issues facing real-world organizational leaders, thus they are of little use to practitioners. This theory-practice gap has contributed to practitioner mistrust for the processes and outcomes of basic research, and a relative dearth of scholarly program evaluation research in this area.    A structured conceptualization technique, Concept Mapping, was used to both identify underlying constructs and develop a theoretical framework for the Empire State Food and Agricultural Leadership Institute, or LEAD New York, a two-year leadership development program for adult professionals in the food and agricultural industry. Program alumni and board members had an active role in identifying specific outcomes, conceptualizing the relationships among outcomes, rating the importance and feasibility of outcomes, and interpreting the data generated in this study. This method is participatory, action oriented, and grounded in a specific context. As a result, the program theory developed through this research is contextualized, explicit, and may be more readily accepted by practitioners in similar settings. Constructs identified in this research were compared to those identified in other contemporary leadership theories, thus building on previous scholarly research.    This study identified 117 specific outcomes, organized into eight distinct constructs, and three regions of related constructs. Relationships between constructs were explored, as were participant ratings of importance and feasibility. The result was the explication of a theoretical framework for the LEAD New York Program. The results of this study suggest that LEAD New York is primarily a leadership skill-building program, but also indicated that the skills developed were highly social, complex, and inter-related. Findings from this study have both immediate utility for program planning (this study served as a process evaluation) and lay the groundwork for future theory-based outcome evaluation.

T1  - Cooperative learning: Attitudes, perceptions, and achievement in a traditional, online, and hybrid instructional setting
AN  - 734815765
AB  - Cooperative learning has been sufficiently studied to be accepted as an effective method of education. Student reception of cooperative learning, and therefore the degree of its success in a given situation, will depend on the mode of delivery. New technology for delivering courses totally online challenges many aspects of traditional education, and is particularly difficult for cooperative learning that relies heavily on intense face-to-face communication among students. This study was conducted to compare cooperative learning in a traditional setting to that in hybrid and online settings. A model for delivering a cooperative learning experience has been developed utilizing concept maps within an upper division college course, History of Biology, as well as a hybrid version of the same course with the cooperative learning module run in a traditional class while the rest of the course remained online. A variation of this model is also being used to compare traditional and hybrid formats of introductory biology courses. The model for cooperative learning worked well for the majority of students. Based on attitudinal results, cooperative learning is equally successful regardless of the amount of face-to-face interaction. Students in the online version of this course were pleased with their cooperative learning experience despite the absence of this interaction. Many stated that it helped them gain a deeper understanding of the material. It also provided students with an environment conducive to peer tutoring and social interaction which is often missing from many online experiences. In each course, an increase in achievement was also indicated. This increase was significant for the hybrid and traditional setting. This model, however, was very challenging for the instructor. The hybrid version of the course was much more user-friendly than its fully online counterpart. This alternative method allows a relatively easy incorporation of cooperative learning for both students and instructor.

T1  - Sensemaking: Conceptual changes, cognitive mechanisms, and structural representations. A qualitative user study
AN  - 733023708
AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to improve our understanding of sensemaking process as a basis for building better systems to assist sensemaking. Sensemaking is the task of creating an understanding of a problem or task so that further actions may be taken in an informed manner. Sensemaking is a pre-requisite for many other tasks such as decision making and problem solving. An important part of sensemaking involves making clear the interrelated concepts and their relationships in a problem or task space.   This research investigated the question of how users create and use structured representations for sensemaking. It proposed and refined an iterative sensemaking model building upon previous sensemaking research, learning theories, cognitive psychology and task-based information seeking and use. In particular, the study focused on the processes, conceptual changes, and cognitive mechanisms used during users‘ sensemaking tasks. The qualitative, multi-case user study investigated how a sample of fifteen users working with news writing and business analysis tasks structure their conceptual space with the assistance of note-taking and concept mapping tools. Data on the sensemaking process were collected from multiple sources including think-aloud protocols, screen movement recordings, interviews, and intermediate and final work products.    Using the iterative sensemaking model as an analytical and descriptive framework, the study captured the often idiosyncratic paths sensemakers took, ranging from planned, systematic to rather random, ad hoc patterns of "search—sensemaking" iterations. Findings also revealed various ways in which the iterations started and exited, which suggested that the heterogeneous patterns of sensemaking lie in the shifts from one iteration to the next, rather than in the iterations themselves. The knowledge structure was updated by accretion, tuning, and restructuring to produce the final knowledge representation and sensemaking product. Several cognitive mechanisms were used in processing new information, examining concepts and relationships, and examining anomalies and inconsistencies. They were used in bottom-up, top-down, and combined fashions to move the processes along and to trigger conceptual changes to the knowledge structure of users.    Based on these findings, the study argues that information system that aimed to assist sensemaking should provide an architecture that links structure, data, and sources that can be represented and manipulated in multiple formats. It should also provide integrated assistances at the task and cognitive mechanism levels.   The research contributes to sensemaking research by extending existing descriptive sensemaking models with an analytical framework that incorporates conceptual changes to the knowledge structure and cognitive mechanisms that trigger the processes and conceptual changes. Furthermore, the research identified core issues in designing information systems to assist sensemaking tasks and suggested design implications for sensemaking tools that may be useful in many settings such as learning, knowledge creation, organization, and sharing.

T1  - Meaningful learning development in student nurses: The traditional nursing care plan versus the concept map care plan approach
AN  - 520223805
AB  - Nurse educators have an important responsibility to prepare students for safe nursing practice. The National League for Nursing advocates the use of innovative, active learning strategies in the educational environment that offer meaningful learning opportunities for students. However, controversy exists related to the effectiveness of the traditional nursing care plan in promoting the development of meaningful learning, and clinical judgment in students. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine if there was a significant difference in meaningful learning development between baccalaureate nursing students who plan nursing care using a traditional nursing care plan compared to those who plan care using a concept map care plan.   The revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire that measures the deep approach or meaningful learning, and the surface approach or rote learning was administered in a pre-test/post-test design. The control group participants used a traditional nursing care plan, and the treatment group participants used a concept map care plan in the clinical setting with both groups completing four of the assigned care plans during the quarter. Findings revealed that both care plan groups primarily used the deep approach to learning that demonstrated an intention to understand and achieve competency of the information. The concept map care plan group scores for meaningful learning increased, and the traditional nursing care plan group scores for meaningful learning decreased. Secondarily, both groups used a surface approach to learning that demonstrated the intention of memorizing essential, targeted information for the purpose of reproducing the information, for instance, on an examination. Both groups’ surface approach scores increased, demonstrating more of an intention to do only what was minimally required by the end of the quarter.   There was a statistically significant difference between groups related to the effectiveness of the care plan preparation, level of satisfaction with the care plan process, and recommendation for use in the future. The data support the importance of ensuring effective preparation for the care plan method being used.   Data in this study provided insufficient evidence regarding whether the traditional nursing care plan or concept map care plan contributed more to the development of meaningful learning.

T1  - Concept map based integration of archaeological data
AN  - 365912591
AB  - Archaeologists use different data models, often designed to reflect the specific needs of their excavations and research, to record primary data. This site-specific approach to data recording increases difficulties during integration. Without integration, archaeological research and education is hampered by limited or difficult access to primary data. A major component in data integration is correctly identifying all mappings between two datasets. In this thesis, we describe an innovative approach to solving this problem through the use of concept maps to represent the relevant ontology. We illustrate our approach through its application to integrate data from two archaeological databases, creating an accurate representation of all of the data integration mappings. Concept maps can be described using XML, a format easily utilized by software applications to automate data integration in the future. Concept maps are not archaeology-specific, so this process can likely be applied to data integration in other domains.

T1  - Connections of caring: A study of Seattle Aquarium volunteer Beach Naturalists
AN  - 305249813
AB  - Regional institutions and resource managers promote individual and collective conservation behavior in support of a healthy and sustainable Puget Sound marine ecosystem. Yet behavioral change is complex; and insufficient understanding exists concerning people's emotional connections to natural environments, their caring practices, and their adoption of conservation behaviors. A review of the literature resulted in a multidisciplinary discussion of connections, meanings, and caring and a conceptual framework that proposed how aspects of people's caring connections with natural resources mediate conservation behavior. A localized qualitative investigation purposively sampled twelve long-term volunteer shoreline interpreters in the Seattle Aquarium Beach Naturalist program and elicited their perspectives on their volunteer role and the nature of caring relations within the interpretation dynamic among the interpreter, shoreline life, and beach visitor. Three mixed-modality data streams (responses to open-ended questions; participant-constructed pictorial conceptual model; verbal narration of the model) collected over two in-depth interviews from each respondent were integrated via textual insertion into the participant's conceptual map. Results were obtained through analysis overarching the study's complete data set of primary statements extracted from participants' concept maps. The study found that central qualities of belonging, meaningfulness, and caring describe interpreters' connections with Puget Sound shorelines and with people visiting the beach. A caring identity was identified as a key construct through which interpreters return those three qualities, as gifts to the world, back to the ecological and social communities in which they serve. A revised conceptual framework both illustrates dimensions of belonging, meaningfulness, and caring within the interpretation dynamic and also presents a model for exploring how change occurs on the three levels of beach-visitor, self-interpreter, and ecological-social community. Understanding the process of change is equally central to this study's findings. Results suggest that volunteer role investment, continuous learning, and interactions with passionate, caring, and supportive staff are factors that support participant belonging, meaningfulness, caring, and change. The influence of constructs identified as key to the interpretation dynamic could be explored from other perspectives (e.g., the visitor receiving interpretive services) in future research to better understand the developmental sequencing of caring identity formation and how change occurs on multiple levels.

T1  - A New Methodology for Designing a Multi-lingual Bio-ontology: An Application to Arabic-English Bio-Information Retrieval
AN  - 2724236745
AB  - Ontologies are becoming increasingly important in the biomedical domain since they enable knowledge sharing in a formal, homogeneous and unambiguous way. Furthermore, biological discoveries are being reported at an extremely rapid rate. This new information is found in diverse resources that encompass a broad array of journal articles and public databases associated with different sub-disciplines within biology and medicine in different languages. However, finding relevant multilingual biological dedicated ontology to the digestive system ontology among a large collection of information is recognized as a critical knowledge gap in science. Consequently, this research argues the real need to highlight the area of ontology in a sense of searching in bio-lingual, representing concepts and inter-concept relationships. English-Arabic human digestive system ontology (DISUS) and its methodology were created to demonstrate the above notion.The approach adopted for this research involved creating a new integrated reengineered methodology for a novel first attempt multilingual (English-Arabic) bio-ontology for the purpose of information retrieval and knowledge discovery. The targeted DISUS ontology is to represent digestive system knowledge and to ease knowledge sharing among the end users in the biology and medicine context .The integrated generic methodology is constitutes of four phases the planning phase which shed light on the scope and purpose of the domain and the functioning of knowledge acquisition, the conceptualisation phase organizes unstructured knowledge to structured. The ontology construction which involves the integration and merging among the core and sub-ontologies. The evaluation phase which finalizes the whole work and this is executed by domain experts.Evaluation of multilingual DISUS carried out through qualitative and quantitative approaches with biological and medical experts, validation was utilized through information retrieval technique and has revealed the effectiveness and robustness of using DISUS ontology as a way for concept mapping between Arabic-English ontologies terms for bilingual searches.

T1  - The Theoretical Learning Impact of a Summer Engineering Program Curriculum for Underrepresented Middle School Students
AN  - 2675223444
AB  - This mixed methods, exploratory and confirmatory study was designed to evaluate the theoretical learning impact of a innovative summer engineering program curriculum would have on its audience, middle school minority students. Several theories were used to develop the innovative curriculum including Human Constructivism, cultural learning styles of African Americans, visual spatial learning and graphic design learning. This study was completed in two phases: evaluation of existing middle school summer engineering program curriculum for best practices and development of innovative curriculum and expert evaluation of the innovative curriculum. Three existing programs from across the country participated in this study. Five engineering education experts evaluated the innovative curriculum. The innovative curriculum is composed of three extensive units that include forces and motion, earth and space science and energy topics. A mixed methods design was used in data collection and analysis to provide a complete view of the theoretical impact of the curriculum.The resulting qualitative and quantitative data indicated the innovative program would enhance its target audience by providing a strong foundation in the fundamental understanding of science and engineering topics and spatial visualization. The qualitative narratives proved that many of the existing programs provide very similar learning environments that do not necessarily include cultural learning, meaningful learning and visual spatial learning. The expert evaluators collectively determined that the innovative program would have a positive and enriching academic impact with the chosen theoretical components. They believed that there was overwhelming evidence (3.7 rating average out of a 4.0) that the theoretical components existed in the curriculum and would provide middle school minority students with the proper knowledge to increase their interest which would inherently increase the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics career pipelines. They also strongly agreed (4.875 rating average out of 5) that the program differed from other program, has relevant learning theories for the target audience exceeded expectations and all the participants of the future program to “see themselves as engineers.”

T1  - Part I: Evaluation of Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) In Two Different Biology 100 Classes Part 2: What Biology Concepts Are Important in General Education?: Analysis of Seventeen Core Concepts
AN  - 2536557010
AB  - The purpose of this two-part study is to examine how to improve introductory level non-majors biology courses to improve student attitude and learning gains in the sciences. The first part of this study examines the collective effect of three different pedagogies (service learning, concept mapping and guest lectures) on student attitude and learning gains in a freshman, non-majors biology course. Two classes, one with the three pedagogies, and one without, were compared. Data were collected from two classes in Fall 2008 (one treatment and one control) and two similar classes replicated in Fall 2009. Learning and attitude gains were measured by a pre and post biology assessment and the Student Assessment of Learning Gains (SALG) survey. Our findings indicate that the treatment methods did not improve student learning or attitudes compared to the control group. However, there was a significant increase in variability in the treatment group, indicating that the students exposed to the three pedagogies either had a very positive experience or a negative one, whereas the control group did not have this variability. Thus, the treatment did have a positive effect on some students. Both treatments experienced significant gains from pre to post on the biology assessment and SALG survey. The second part of the study investigated what concepts are considered by students and faculty to be most important to teach in introductory non-majors biology courses. A survey with 17 biology concepts was given to life science professors at BYU and UVU and biology students at BYU. Participants were asked to rank the concepts from most to least important. There were significant differences between professor and student mean rankings for 11 of the 17 biology concepts. This study showed a large discrepancy between what professors want students to learn and what students feel is important. It was particularly noteworthy that students ranked ecology and evolution as least important. This was especially alarming since evolution is considered to be the capstone of all biology and ecology is vital for capturing the "big picture" in biology.

T1  - On the road to a software profession: students’ experiences of concepts and thresholds
AN  - 2001949787
AB  - Research has shown that there are gaps in knowledge between newly hired and experienced professionals and that some of these gaps are related to concepts, such as the concepts of object orientation. This problem, and the fact that most computer science majors want to work in the software industry, leads to questions regarding why these gaps exist and how students can be better prepared for their future careers. Against this background, this thesis addresses two theme-based perspectives that focus on students' views of concepts in Computer Science.The first theme-based perspective investigated the existence of potential Threshold Concepts in Computer Science. Such concepts should be troublesome, transformative, irreversible, and integrative. Qualitative methods have been mainly used and empirical data have been collected through semi-structured interviews, concept maps, and written stories. The results identified two Threshold Concepts, suggested several more, and then described the ways in which these concepts have transformed students.The second theme-based perspective took a phenomenographic approach to find the variation in how students understand concepts related to the software profession. Data were collected via semi-structured interviews. In one study the interviews were held in connection with role-playing where students took on the role of a newly hired programmer. The results show a variety of ways to experience the addressed phenomena in the student collective, ranging from superficial views that often have a practical nature to more sophisticated understandings that reflect a holistic approach, including a professional point of view.Educators can use the results to emphasize concepts that are important from students' perspectives. The phenomenographic outcome spaces can help teachers to reflect upon their own ways of seeing contrasted with student conceptions. I have indicated how variation theory can be applied to open more sophisticated ways of seeing, which in this context stresses the professional aspects to help students prepare for becoming professional software developers.

T1  - Learning from Adverse Incidents: Using Action Research Cycles to Generate Individual and Organisational Knowledge
AN  - 1779537139
AB  - This thesis represents a body of work which is about individual and organisational learning from adverse incidents, the context of the studies was the National Health Service (NHS). The thesis presents a series of exploratory studies which were undertaken in order to discover whether NHS staff had a disposition to learn from adverse incidents and whether their employing organisations were indicative of a supportive learning environment. The studies began with the premise that failing to support NHS staff to learn from adverse incidents contributed to their occmTence and re-occurrence.This thesis makes a contribution to the scientific community in a number of ways; firstly it relates findings from exploring deep approaches to individual and organisational learning from adverse incidents. Secondly the thesis highlights the role of educational leadership as a mechanism for overcoming organisational barriers to learning from adverse incidents. Lastly and most importantly the thesis demonstrates that while progress is being made to educate staff towards achieving greater patient safety, there is much to be gained from concentrating educational efforts on supporting learning in the workplace. To this end the thesis illuminates how workplace learning from adverse incidents can be viewed as a source of positivelearning for both the individual and the organisation and, presents findings from a new piloted approach to learning in which the student/participants came to view learning from adverse incidents as a positive experience. The thesis concludes with a range of tools specifically designed to support NHS staff in the workplace to learn from adverse incidents.

T1  - A Knowledge Map-Centric Feedback-Based Approach to Information Modeling and Academic Assessment
AN  - 1020136625
AB  - The structure of education has changed dramatically in the last few decades. Despite major changes in how students are learning, there has not been as dramatic of a shift in how student learning is assessed. Standard letter grades are still the paradigm for evaluating a student’s mastery of course content and the grade point average is still one of the largest determining factors in judging a graduate’s academic aptitude.    This research presents a modern approach to modeling knowledge and evaluating students. Based upon the model of a closed-loop feedback controller it considers education as a system with an instructor determining the set of knowledge he or she wishes to impart to students, the instruction method as a transfer function, and evaluation methods serving as sensors to provide feedback determining the subset of the information students have learned. This method uses comprehensive concept maps to depict all of the concepts and relationships an educator intends to cover and student maps to depict the subset of knowledge that students have mastered. Concept inventories are used as an assessment tool to determine, at the conceptual level, what students have learned. Each question in the concept inventory is coupled with one or more components of a comprehensive concept map and based upon the answers students give to concept inventory questions those components may or may not appear in a student’s knowledge map. The level of knowledge a student demonstrates of each concept and relationship is presented in his or her student map using a color scheme tied to the levels of learning in Bloom’s taxonomy.    Topological principles are used to establish metrics to quantify the distance between two students’ knowledge maps and the distance between a student’s knowledge map and the corresponding comprehensive concept map. A method is also developed for forming aggregate maps representative of the knowledge of a group of students. Aggregate maps can be formed for entire classes of students or based upon various demographics including race and gender.    XML schemas have been used throughout this research to encapsulate the information in both comprehensive maps and student maps and to store correlations between concept inventory questions and corresponding comprehensive map components. Three software packages have been developed to store concept inventories into an XML Schema, to process student responses to concept inventory questions and generate student maps as a result, and to generate aggregate maps. The methods presented herein have been applied to two learning units that are part of two freshman engineering courses at Virginia Tech. Example student maps and aggregate maps are included for these course units.

This study adopted a randomized-based experimental design. A two (high and low levels of self-directed learning ability) by four (instructional treatments with or without concept maps) factorial research model was built. The independent variables were concept map and self-directed learning; the dependent variables were the three criterion tests (identification, terminology, and comprehension test) measuring participants’ hypermedia learning performances. Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA), a primary statistical technique, was used in this experimental study.    Undergraduate students (n=126) voluntarily participated in this study. Based on the median score of the SDLRS measurement, student participants were divided into two levels (high or low) of self-directed learning. Through stratified sampling, participants in each group were randomly assigned into four instructional treatments: Treatment 1 (Control 1: text-only), Treatment 2 (Control 2: static images), Treatment 3 (traditional concept maps), and Treatment 4 (visualized-based concept maps).    Through data analysis, this study yielded eight findings: (1) Students’ self-directed learning abilities would not relate to their learning performances. No relationship existed between self-directed learning and learning performance. (2) Different concept maps would not influence students’ self-directed learning abilities since no significant interaction existed between instructional strategy (concept maps) and self-directed learning. (3) Visualized-based concept maps were significantly better than traditional concept maps for identification and terminology tests. (4) Traditional concept maps would not significantly support student learning. (5) Static images (visuals) significantly improved students’ learning performances. (6) Participants’ background information, as extraneous variables, would not influence the results of this study. (7) Visual instruction was students’ preference. Both visualized-based concept maps and static visual effectively supported student learning. (8) Based on Guglielmino’s standard, students’ self-directed learning abilities tend to be low level in this study.

T1  - The use of a metacognitive tool to track learning in science by adults
AN  - 899751834
AB  - The territory covered by this work includes the response to new information in science by adults. A central aim is to shed some light on the problem of how new and more complex knowledge (specifically conceptual knowledge) develops or arises from old and less complex knowledge. This problem has challenged both philosophers and educators for over twenty centuries. The study draws on perspectives from several academic disciplines, in particular from philosophy, science, and sociology, and to a lesser extent from psychology. These disciplines are used in the first part of the thesis to set the context, both for the problem and for the qualitative research approach which tackles it, as well as to review literature that pertains to the field. Among hindrances to learning that are considered, particular attention is given to difficulties encountered with science texts; trials of some experimental approaches to the problems are included. The central research question concerns how adults learning science respond to new information, especially information that conflicts with their existing knowledge. The problem is approached within a constructivist framework using the metacognitive tool of the concept map as a means of tracking the type of learning (deep or surface) that is taking place. Data relating to the type of learning are also produced through questionnaires and interviews from volunteer participants who are pursuing further and higher education courses that include mandatory science components. The results of the study indicate considerable reluctance to abandon what has been learned previously, in favour of new information. Contrary to expectation was the discovery that adults respond to new information with surface learning strategies, placing extensive reliance (initially at least) on memory, whether or not they declare a preference for meaningful learning. There are implications of this discovery for those who plan and deliver short 'refresher' training courses.

T1  - Clinical faculty's activities and outputs: An intellectual capital concept map
AN  - 89186293
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the composition of intellectual capital (IC) by addressing the research question: What are the knowledge-based activities and outputs which comprise the IC of a university medical department? A conceptual framework was developed to highlight the importance of activities. The conceptualization of IC was further developed using concept mapping. Education administrators' perceptions were solicited to derive IC used in a research faculty of a Canadian university. The results indicate that IC can be understood in terms of activities and outputs. Clinical faculty can be expected to engage in research and its supervision, education, obtaining qualifications, clinical and professional practice, and service. Within these categories, individual activities and outputs were not considered to be of equal importance or impact. Among seventy activities and outputs, articles in internationally refereed journals was ranked as most important, whereas teaching awards was ranked as having the most impact.

T1  - Artistic Approaches to Environmental Education: Developing Eco-art Education in Elementary Classrooms
AN  - 808584037
AB  - This dissertation explores curriculum development in eco-art education, an integration of art education and environmental education, as a means of increasing awareness of and engagement with learning about the environment. The creation of eco-art curricula in school settings was investigated by tracking how elementary teachers' knowledge and understanding of eco-art education resulted in learning experiences for their students.    Guided by the frameworks of collaborative action research and arts-informed research, a team of four elementary teachers and a university-based educator exchanged and generated practical and theoretical knowledge in order to plan, implement, observe and reflect on the development of eco-art curricula over the span of a school year. By drawing on the expertise and experience of the team members, the research aimed to acknowledge the central role teachers play in the design of innovative curricula and pedagogy and maximize the benefits inherent in school-university partnerships.    Data was collected in four schools over the course of nine months, and analyzed, interpreted and shared through a combination of thematic analysis, concept-mapping and arts-informed research strategies. As the first dissertation to examine eco-art learning in a sustained way across multiple school sites, it offers evidence to demonstrate that eco-art curricula can take a multitude of forms and promote environmental learning in a variety of ways. The extensive database of elementary eco-art lessons created as part of the study highlights the roles of collaboration, place-based learning, systems-thinking and stewardship in eco-art learning, as well as the importance of using biodegradable materials and natural processes in making eco-art with children.    Presented as a combination of text and imagery, this dissertation also makes connections between the study and the author's ongoing work in community arts and guerilla art gardening as a means to elucidate the praxis of eco-art education. In this, eco-art education is shown to offer an innovative means for teachers to weave together learning about art and the environment in school-based settings.

T1  - Utilizing concept mapping as a teaching and learning tool to prepare for the science taks test
AN  - 725594488
AB  - Concept mapping was used with Donna High School students to determine its effect on the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills (TAKS) test. Concept mapping was used with models such as the Sheltered Instruction Observation Protocol model (SIOP), the 5-E model, and the Learning Groups model. This measure was taken because the models used have not helped students improve their TAKS scores significantly. The findings of this research reveals that using the process of concept mapping together with the SIOP model helps students clearly see related concepts and motivates them to think more deeply. Students quickly realize what concepts they have learned and details they still do not understand (2).

T1  - Millennial students' mental models of information retrieval
AN  - 717707264
AB  - This qualitative study examines first-year college students’ online search habits in order to identify patterns in millennials’ mental models of information retrieval. The study employed a combination of modified contextual inquiry and concept mapping methodologies to elicit students’ mental models. The researcher confirmed previously observed millennial behavior including preference for searching rather than browsing and hypertext reading. The study found three basic types of mental models; those with a network view conducted more searches overall and more complex (Boolean and topic + focus) searches. However, none of the participants demonstrated strong mental models that increased their effectiveness in searching.

T1  - Nurse educators' implementation of concept mapping, case studies, and reflective-thinking exercises in undergraduate didactic nursing courses at baccalaureate schools of nursing: A qualitative study
AN  - 305178701
AB  - The pedagogies of concept mapping, case studies, and reflective-thinking exercises are associated with learner-centered education; they focus on the learner instead of the educator. Learner-centered pedagogies are believed to improve students' level of cognition. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the implementation strategies of concept mapping, case studies, and reflective-thinking exercises in didactic undergraduate nursing courses.    Purposeful sampling was utilized in this qualitative multisite case-study designed. For each of the four participants, three separate site visits were completed. Observations and brief postobservational interviews took place at each site visit. Transcribed data from interviews, observations, and pertinent course documents were imported into the computer program Nvivo8. Repetitive comparative analysis was utilized to complete the data coding process.    Research question one focused on the implementation strategies that were being implemented by my participants. For the pedagogy of concept mapping, two primary themes emerged: student-generated and instructor-generated concept mapping. The theme of student-generated concept mapping was divided into formative and summative mapping. The pedagogy of concept mapping was primarily utilized as a student-generated activity. Some mapping assignments were used as summative evaluation activities; however, the greatest amount of mapping was performed by the students and were ungraded.    The pedagogy of case study also offered two themes: formal and informal use of case studies. The theme of formal use of case studies yielded two subthemes; case studies used within the classroom and outside of the classroom. The informal use of case studies by my participants was the most utilized pedagogy. The retrieval of both spontaneously and preplanned case studies during a lecture was carried out by each of my participants multiple times during my observational site visits. Reflective-thinking exercises were found to be implemented via two methods: sharing reflections among fellow classmates and sharing reflections with only the instructor. The pedagogy of reflective-thinking exercises were found to be the least pedagogy utilized by my participants; however, it was found to have a contribution to the other two pedagogies in that reflection was addressed within both concept mapping and case studies.    Research question two investigated the perceived reasons the participants believed that the three pedagogies enhanced learning at a higher level of cognition. Two themes emerged; the first was that the students were  active in the learning process. The second theme was that the pedagogies were believed to increase the student nurses ability to integrate  material covered in the didactic setting to that of the clinical practice of nursing. It was perceived by the four participants that the mental activity, required by the three pedagogies, was important for the application of theory within a student nurses' clinical practice. Results of this investigation have led to an increased understanding of how and why these three pedagogies are utilized in undergraduate baccalaureate schools of nursing didactic courses.

T1  - Learning through student- authored interactive media: A mixed methods exploration
AN  - 305177211
AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve student achievement in science and proficiency in information and communication technologies (ICT), which are vital 21st century workforce skills. Instead of isolating the issues, the study proposed an integrated solution that applied the constructivist approach to help students learn about a unit in biology using three software applications to create interactive, self-correcting eModules within a two-week period. Research questions focused on the effectiveness of the instructional strategy, the experience of students authoring eModules, obstacles they encountered, and the role of the teacher.    Fifty-one out of the possible 55 eleventh and twelfth grade students in the two Advanced Biology classes consented to participate in the study. A comparison of pre and post-test scores showed an average 547% improvement. Students with low initial scores of 10% or less improved an average of 1229%. Ten students (20%) went from 20% or below on the pre-test to 80% or above on the post-test, and were analyzed as a subgroup called “big gainers.” Student journals and exit surveys were explored to understand the process students followed to develop eModules. The majority of student responses in the exit survey (85%) described the overall experience as a positive one. Journals showed how students were able to follow the process of creating a concept map using Inspiration software, converting the outline into a PowerPoint slide show, editing the slides and importing them into Adobe Captivate files, inserting self-correcting questions, completing their eModules, and submitting them to their teacher. Students identified obstacles they encountered to help them to problem solve and provided data for improving the instructional strategy. Addressing technology learning objectives within the context and pacing of a content area class was accomplished, but it required providing a collaborative learning environment, an appropriate task, mediating tools, and assessment.    The data analysis suggests that the instructional strategy of student-authored eModules had a positive impact on learning science content and ICT proficiencies. Historically students have been consumers of interactive media or producers of presentational media. This study suggests that they will learn more when they are the authors of interactive media.

T1  - Using social network analysis to examine how perceived beliefs affect service quality in public higher education institutions
AN  - 305168074
AB  - In business, educational, and other organizations, team members often connect with one another in informal groups in order to fill certain needs (Accel-Team, 2006). Such needs include the ability to connect with others who share worldviews, opinions, or beliefs. When social network analysis (SNA) or concept mapping is used to examine interpersonal interactions in higher education institutions, administrators can learn about the informal relationships between the people in their departments and how those relationships affect workflow and customer service. For the purpose of this study, “beliefs” can be defined as confidence, faith, or trust. “Customer service” can be defined as service to students, faculty, and other staff members.   The purpose of this research was to assess whether perceived beliefs affect quality of service at public higher education institutions (IHEs). Online surveys and interviews were designed to collect information related to participant beliefs and the workplace. Study results indicate that while perceived beliefs influence sociability at IHEs, a more focused qualitative project that includes observation and interviews may provide more detailed information about the nature of workplace networks and the influence perceived beliefs have on their formation.   Keywords. beliefs, social network analysis, higher education institutions, customer service

T1  - The game of science: A grounded theory of the Café Scientifique experience
AN  - 305165622
AB  - Science Cafés are independent groups organized throughout the world for discussion of scientific topics. Little is known about the nature of this informal learning environment. A grounded-theory study was conducted to determine what attendees perceived as the essential qualities of the Café Scientifique experience in one science Café in the Western United States. Interviews with 12 attendees were transcribed and analyzed using ATLAS-ti. Concept maps and a grounded theory describing the essential characteristics were created. Member checking was used during theory generation. Findings are described in the context of a game metaphor, whereby scientific discussion at the Café is viewed as an intellectual game. The grounded theory describes the game of science being played at Café Scientifique involving attendees as players, social norms as rules for the game, an expert as the steward of truth, topics as the content for game play, interaction as playing of the game, and intellectual stimulation as the prize for playing. During the game, ideas were identified through a short presentation followed by a question-and-answer session. During this exchange, attendees heard about, analyzed, synthesized, and applied new information. As a result of the game play, players won a prize—intellectual stimulation. The Café Scientifique phenomenon provides insight into informal adult education. This study suggests the need for additional study of intellectual play in adult education, the role of curiosity and desire to explore new ways of thinking, and the developmental drive in adults to seek intellectual stimulation. The essential characteristics of Café Scientifique may be transferable to other informal adult-education settings.

T1  - Computational narrative simulation for organizational learning
AN  - 305148262
AB  - Organizational learning (OL) is one of the most important capabilities for the survival of an organization. Organizations need to have the dynamic capabilities to create, capture, harvest, share, replenish and apply their knowledge. Knowledge comes from experience and resides in the narratives, so the acquisition of knowledge must be interwoven with the process of applying it. However, it is difficult to acquire knowledge from narratives and difficult to share it efficiently and effectively. Traditional methods are ineffective in fulfilling the requirements of the knowledge processes and in supporting the factors that facilitate OL.    In the present study, a Computational Narrative Simulation (CNS) approach is presented and a Computational Narrative Simulation System (CNSS) has been designed and built to overcome the limitations in the existing methods. By incorporating the technologies of knowledge-based systems and artificial intelligence, four computational intelligent algorithms have been developed for supporting the automation of the narrative simulation. These algorithms are: Fuzzy-Associated Concept Mapping, Narrative Prediction and Construction, Hybrid Case-based Reasoning, and Self-Associated Concept Mapping.    To evaluate the performance of these algorithms, a series of quantitative experiments has been carried out. The value and capability of these algorithms are realized by using various public databases and industrial data. The results are also benchmarked with well known algorithms. The performance of the CNSS is evaluated as a whole in real-life implementation. A prototype system has been built and trial implemented for case management in a social service organization.    On the whole, the CNS methodology addresses the deficiencies and limitations of traditional approaches. With the successful development of the CNS methodology and hence the CNSS, an organization is able to manage narrative knowledge in a systemic manner. The CNSS provides an important means for automatic integration of narratives with simulation so that the time for construction of a narrative simulation can be dramatically reduced, and the learners can test their actions and consequences of such actions during the simulation. The four purpose built algorithms does not only contribute to the advancement of the computational intelligent technologies, it also provides an important means for supporting the building the CNSS.

T1  - A meta -analytical review of Novak's concept mapping
AN  - 305136984
AB  - The current systematic review furthers the field of Novak's concept mapping founded on Ausubel meaningful learning theory. Based upon 46 effects from 38 studies, the results indicate that Novak's concept maps are effective learning tools for enhancing and promoting achievement among students. Within the learning domains of Science, English/English as a Second Language, Education, and Electives, concept mapping improves achievement. However, within the learning domain of Math, concept mapping groups did not demonstrate improvement of achievement. Both computer-generated and non-computer generated maps are effective means for creating maps, though non-computer-generated maps were slightly more effective. Suggestions for future research by learning domain and by means of map generation are included.

T1  - The use of a computer graphic organizer for persuasive composition writing by Hispanic students with specific learning disabilities
AN  - 305131545
AB  - Many culturally and linguistically diverse (CLD) students with specific learning disabilities (SLD) struggle with the writing process. Particularly, they have difficulties developing and expanding ideas, organizing and elaborating sentences, and revising and editing their compositions (Graham, Harris, & Larsen, 2001; Myles, 2002). Computer graphic organizers offer a possible solution to assist them in their writing. This study investigated the effects of a computer graphic organizer on the persuasive writing compositions of Hispanic middle school students with SLD. A multiple baseline design across subjects was used to examine its effects on six dependent variables: number of arguments and supporting details, number and percentage of transferred arguments and supporting details, planning time, writing fluency, syntactical maturity (measured by T-units, the shortest grammatical sentence without fragments), and overall organization. Data were collected and analyzed throughout baseline and intervention.    Participants were taught persuasive writing and the writing process prior to baseline. During baseline, participants were given a prompt and asked to use paper and pencil to plan their compositions. A computer was used for typing and editing. Intervention required participants to use a computer graphic organizer for planning and then a computer for typing and editing. The planning sheets and written composition were printed and analyzed daily along with the time each participant spent on planning.    The use of computer graphic organizers had a positive effect on the planning and persuasive writing compositions. Increases were noted in the number of supporting details planned, percentage of supporting details transferred, planning time, writing fluency, syntactical maturity in number of T-units, and overall organization of the composition. Minimal to negligible increases were noted in the mean number of arguments planned and written. Varying effects were noted in the percent of transferred arguments and there was a decrease in the T-unit mean length.    This study extends the limited literature on the effects of computer graphic organizers as a prewriting strategy for Hispanic students with SLD. In order to fully gauge the potential of this intervention, future research should investigate the use of different features of computer graphic organizer programs, its effects with other writing genres, and different populations.

T1  - Emotional coping and literacy intervention decisions: How hearing parents guide their deaf children
AN  - 305130774
AB  - This qualitative case study investigated the process by which eight hearing parents went about making decisions to promote language acquisition and literacy learning in their deaf children, who or what influenced that process, and how they coped emotionally with the impact of deafness on literacy and language acquisition. Data from interview transcripts were analyzed to isolate common influences across cases. Concept maps were also used to explore relationships between these influences. It was found that over time, parents came to rely on themselves because they were often disappointed by the medical community and educational-placement agencies. Research, site visits, and the influence of trusted educators all served to educate and guide the parents, especially as they grew more concerned about the influence of their children’s intellectual and social peer groups. Signing was generally recognized as beneficial by families, though in some cases it also caused tensions. Finally, as parents made site visits to schools, some encountered what they perceived to be forms of extremism that disturbed them.

T1  - The influence of graphic organizers on students' ability to summarize and comprehend science content regarding the Earth's changing surface
AN  - 305094752
AB  - The purpose of this action research project was to determine how my practice of using graphic organizers during instruction influenced my students' ability to summarize and comprehend significant fifth grade Earth Science content regarding the Earth's changing surface. A secondary purpose was to determine the students' perceptions of how concept mapping assisted in making connections to understand the fifth grade Earth Science content regarding the Earth's changing surface.    The three processes used to collect data for this research were concept maps, focus groups and the pre- and post-test results. The themes that emerged were the ability to describe, categorize and classify details, the increased accuracy of the use of vocabulary and the memory of the concepts that students' ability to recall information and understand the Earth Science concepts as evidenced through summarization and comprehension through the pre- and post-test.

T1  - An analysis of science conceptual knowledge in journals of students with disabilities and normally achieving students
AN  - 305086424
AB  - Science education reforms of the last two decades have focused on raising the bar for ALL students which includes students with mild to moderate disabilities. Formative assessment can be used to assess the progress of these students to inquire, understand scientific concepts, reason scientifically, make decisions, and communicate effectively in science. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of science journals as a formative assessment in a guided inquiry unit of study for students with learning disabilities. Two normally achieving students (NA) and five students with learning disabilities (SLD) participated in a study of mammals that utilized journals to record the development of student knowledge through the course of study. Students were interviewed after the lessons were complete using the same prompts required in the journals. Themes were developed from the student writings and their verbal discourse using Grounded Theory. Journals and verbal discourse were rated following the themes of Knowledge Telling (KT) and Knowledge Transformation (KTR). Concept maps were developed for the Pre and Post test lessons (written and verbal discourses) by the raters in an attempt to further explain the knowledge that the students conveyed. The results of this study suggest that SLD are able to demonstrate knowledge about mammals better through verbal discourse than written discourse. While the NA students wrote more and used more technical discourse than did their SLD peers, the conceptual understanding of the topic by the SLD was no less inclusive than their NA peers when accessed verbally. The journals demonstrated limited conceptual growth for the SLD. Further, while lexical density is important to the development of knowledge in science, this study suggests the “conceptual density” may be another important indicator to examine.

T1  - Cognitive processes of medical students in clinical reasoning
AN  - 305036667
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore thinking processes, identify thinking patterns of medical students in clinical reasoning and examine the role of subject matter and its impact. Using a three-step coding process, transcripts from a think aloud protocol completed by twelve 4th year medical students was analyzed. A grounded theory, the flow network theory of integration, emerged from the data. The theory was defined as a process of coordinating separate elements in motion to a balanced flexible whole. The flow network theory of integration showed how medical students engaged in three increasing levels of integration as they developed their clinical reasoning skills: basic integration, progressive integration, and networked integration. The theory also revealed the pivotal role that the connection among concepts played in the development of such an increasingly complex integrated network. Within such levels of integration medical students utilized four levels of thinking processes and three different thinking patterns. The thinking processes of the students included: progression in complexity, creation of knowledge clusters, active differentiation, and integration of qualifiers. These different thinking processes and patterns appeared to be similar across subject matter domains, but may vary depending on the complexity of the clinical problem or the ill-structured nature of the problem. Implications for medical students, clinicians and medical educators were discussed.

T1  - Examining standardized terminology to support evidence based nursing practice for patients with depressive symptoms in primary care
AN  - 305036028
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how standardized nursing terminologies (SNTs) represented Evidence Based Practice (EBP) recommendations for adults with depression in primary care and to describe nursing practice for patients with depressive symptoms as represented in a SNT. The Aurora Cerner University of Wisconsin-Knowledge Based Nursing Initiative (ACW-KBNI) conceptual framework was used to guide this study.    A mixed methods design using quantitative and qualitative methods was used to answer the study questions. EBP recommendations were mapped to two SNTs through lexical and semantic concept mapping and expert review. Nursing practice documentation represented by SNT, within a clinical information system (CIS), at a community nursing center (CNC), was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The CIS data were examined for adult patients with depressive symptoms. The final component of the study was a qualitative analysis comparing the findings from the mappings of the EBP recommendations to SNT with the findings from the CIS data analysis. A content analysis was conducted to identify areas of similarity and differences between the mappings and the CIS documentation of practice.    Study findings included 92% of the EBP recommendation key concepts were able to be mapped at a semantic level to one of the SNTs. Most (80.5%) of the mappings were partial semantic (conceptual meaning) of the concepts. This finding raises concern with the ambiguity that could occur because of partial mappings.    The findings from the CIS identified 685 unique patients seen at the CNC over a period of 30 months. Thirty three (4.3%) of patients met the study criteria for patients with depressive symptoms. Findings from the assessment, diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes included a higher frequency of mental health problems in the sub sample, with the most frequent intervention being Teaching, Guidance, and Counseling. The final component of the study compared the two data sets. The findings were conceptually a comparison was possible but the level of specificity was of concern.    Recommendations for future practice, research, education, and policy were discussed. Future research is needed to explore the process of mapping EBP recommendations to SNTs. Researchers also need to explore development of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) within the CIS. CDSS has the potential to improve the consistency and clarity of documentation. The use of SNT within CIS has the potential to improve the description of nursing practice and the impact of nursing on patient outcomes.

T1  - The relationship between adolescents' domain knowledge and creative performance on an ill -defined physics task
AN  - 305011002
AB  - This research explored the relationship between knowledge and creativity. More specifically, the study addressed the question of how domain knowledge contributed to creative performance on an ill-defined physics problem in a sample of adolescents attending an enrichment program for gifted students. While most contemporary theories of creativity highlight the knowledge base as a key component of creativity, very little research has explicitly investigated the relationship between knowledge and creativity in the context of creative problem solving. Employing a version of Amabile's (1983) Consensual Assessment Technique, this study explored (a) to what extent domain knowledge contributed to creative performance over and above divergent thinking ability and general intellectual ability, (b) what qualities of the domain knowledge base were associated with creative performance, and (c) how domain knowledge was applied to facilitate creative problem solving. In a mixed-methods research design, the first question was addressed through hierarchical regression, while data pertaining to the second question were analyzed descriptively and the third involved the qualitative analysis of think-aloud protocols.    Among the key findings were: (a) scores on a physics test did not significantly predict performance on the creative problem solving task; (b) participants with the highest creativity scores were more likely than those who scored lowest to sort a set of physics word problems into categories based on key concepts rather than surface features, to group pairs of problems in a manner that reflected a deeper understanding of physics and to construct more conceptually-organized physics concept maps; and (c) participants with the highest creativity scores tended to explain their solutions to the creative problem solving task in terms of relevant physics concepts, to reason towards a solution by generating and testing hypotheses grounded in domain knowledge, and to combine concepts and materials in unusual and effective ways. Findings are discussed in relation to research and theory related to expertise and the creative process. In particular, similarities are drawn between the characteristics and application of the domain knowledge base commonly found in experts and those that distinguished creative from less creative participants in the context of the ill-defined task in this study.

T1  - Teaching taboo topics without talking about them: An epistemic study of a new approach to HIV /AIDS prevention education in India
AN  - 304999967
AB  - Background. Solving the problem of how to provide effective health education on diseases subject to social taboos is an immediate need. The social stigma of HIV/AIDS is particularly prominent in the developing world, where 95 percent of all HIV-infected persons live. Millions of people are risking death from HIV/AIDS while cultures and laws resist change. New approaches must be created to provide education despite whatever social, structural, cultural, and legal barriers exist. Fortunately, the emergence of new media and information and communication technologies (ICT) has provided new ways to help bypass social taboos and provide effective education in ways which were not possible in the past. This dissertation discusses these challenges and presents criteria for evaluating the efficacy of various educational campaigns aimed at promoting awareness relating to taboo topics using a specially designed HIV/AIDS curriculum—Interactive Teaching AIDS—as an exemplar. In health interventions, knowledge is a necessary, although seldom sufficient, step to bring about changes in attitudes and behaviors.    The Interactive Teaching AIDS (ITA) application was developed, tested, and optimized over a two-year period to promote HIV/AIDS education despite social and cultural challenges. It incorporates key pedagogical and communication theories and approaches in order to maximize its efficacy. To provide psychological comfort and promote coherent understanding, this ICT-based application couples the presentation of biological aspects of transmission with culturally-familiar euphemisms and metaphors to communicate ideas about prevention measures. Through a rigorous, iterative, research-based process, the 20-minute application provides detailed yet accessible culturally-appropriate explanations of all key aspects of HIV/AIDS prevention. The process included the development of multiple prototypes and over 150 iterations in total, starting with concept maps, screenplays, storyboards, and low-fidelity paper prototypes, eventually leading to interactive versions of the curriculum in multiple media, including a final version in Adobe Flash.    Methodology. High school and college students ( N=386) from New Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab, were randomly selected across four institutes in India. No one refused to participate. Students at three of the four institutes were assigned to the intervention group, and students at the fourth institute were assigned to the control group. Intervention students received the ITA application. All students received a baseline pretest, followed by an immediate posttest, and finally a retention test one month later to assess outcomes. The assessments measured knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention methods as well as attitudes regarding social acceptance of those infected with the virus.    Results. Experimental students exhibited statistically significant gains in posttest knowledge (p<.001) and positive changes in attitudes (p<.001), even after controlling for pretest knowledge, gender, mother's education and father's education. One month later, the experimental students retained significant amounts of prevention knowledge (p<.001) and displayed positive changes in attitudes (p<.05). On the 40-item knowledge assessment, the experimental group scored 8.25 points higher than the control group participants during the posttest, and 7.03 points higher during the retention test. At onset, males performed significantly better on the pretest than females ( p<.01), however, after interacting with the ITA application, there was no differences between the knowledge gained and retained by males or females in the posttest or retention test, closing the achievement gap. Although HIV/AIDS is generally considered a taboo topic to discuss throughout India, 98.6 percent of intervention students indicated they were comfortable learning from the application, and 94.5 percent said they learned more about prevention through the ITA tutorial than through any other prior communications channel, including television and school. Results revealed that after watching the animated tutorial, a significantly greater proportion of intervention students indicated they felt less afraid of interacting with HIV-infected people rather than feeling more afraid (p<.001) and were less afraid of being infected with HIV rather than more afraid (p<.001). One month later, students exposed to the intervention were significantly more likely to share information with others (p<.001) and were actively seeking additional HIV/AIDS information on their own (p<.001).    Conclusion. For people living in areas that cannot easily access explicit HIV/AIDS materials due to social, cultural or other constraints, these results suggest that it is possible to design curricula that are socially-acceptable and accurate, that promote significant gains in learning, retention, and changes in attitudes. Furthermore these materials can encourage learners to proactively seek more information regarding the taboo topic and share prevention information with others. Educators who are reticent to teach about such subjects due to embarrassment or lack of health expertise can utilize such applications to educate students. Such efforts can also close the knowledge gap between female and male learners.

T1  - Discovering the sources of impact of college on LGBTQ students' identity development and mapping those experiences
AN  - 304998259
AB  - Despite the growing visibility of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Questioning or Queer (LGBTQ) undergraduates in colleges and universities throughout the United States, the effect of college experiences on the development of identity for this subgroup of students has been little studied. In a two-phase mixed methods study, 100 LGBTQ undergraduates completed critical incident reports describing the experiences they perceived to be most influential on their developing sense of self. From these incidents, raters identified categories of experience that reflected issues integral to sexual and student identity. The most prominent categories identified were Experiencing Acceptance after Coming Out and Experiencing the Support of Others which were on the positive end of the positive rating scale and Experiencing Homophobia, Experiencing Bi-phobia and Feeling Judged or  Labeled by Others which appeared on the negative end of the same rating scale. The categories were assigned similarity ratings by study participants and were analyzed using multidimensional scaling (MDS). A two dimensional scale was used with Dimension 1 labeled as External versus Internal Processes and Dimension 2 as Finding Support through Others versus Acceptance of Self. The concept map which resulted graphically displays how LGBTQ undergraduates conceptually organize their understanding of the impact of college on their identity development. The concept map was analyzed using hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA). Three clusters were created which illustrate unity among the categories within that particular structure. These three clusters are:  Life-Changing Incidents, Interactive Intimacy, and Affirmation of Self. Suggestions for further research and implications for college faculty, staff, and administration are articulated. Implications for the study include suggestions regarding development and use of support systems, potential faculty and staff trainings, course possibilities, and the need for future leadership to impact organizational structures.

T1  - The sources of impact on First-Generation Latino college students' identity development: From the students' perspective
AN  - 304997095
AB  - Despite the growing number of First-Generation Latino undergraduates enrolled at Loyola Marymount University (LMU), the effect of their college experiences on the development of identity in this subgroup of students has limited studies.    This two-phase, mixed methods study examined (a) the sources of impact that first-generation Latino undergraduate students perceived to have affected their personal identity development; and (b) how they conceptually organized these experiences. Through a purposeful sampling strategy, 89 Latino undergraduates at LMU participated in the first phase of the study by completing the College Years Experience Questionnaire (CYEQ). Using a variant of Flangan’s (1954) Critical Incident Technique, the CYEQ asked participants to reflect on their experience as a college student and report experiences that had affected their sense of who they are. A team of three doctoral students identified 13 categories of impact in the incidents. In Phase Two, the 13 identified categories of experience were then assigned similarity ratings by a small sample of study participants.    Using multidimensional scaling (MDS), a two-dimensional concept map was created from Phase Two data to illustrate how these undergraduates organized the experiences. The dimension weights were used to plot the coordinates of the 13 themes and the dimensions were named Validation through Change versus Validation through Relationships and Validation through Achievement versus Validation through Social Organizations. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) was used to define a three cluster solution that illustrated how the themes were qualitatively different. The raters named the three clusters to describe the types of themes contained in each cluster.    The 13 themes that emerged during the analysis of Phase One data were associated with key factors that theory and prior research identified as influencing personal identity development. The resulting concept map displayed in graphic form how these first-generation Latino undergraduates conceptually organized their understanding of the impact of college on their identity development. Limitations of the study, suggestions for further research, and implications for college faculty, staff, and administration is delineated.

AB  - The current study examined how the type of training a team receives (team coordination training vs. cross-training) influences the type of team mental model structures that form and how those mental models in turn impact team performance under different environmental condition (routine vs. non-routine). Three-hundred and fifty-two undergraduate students from a large northeastern university participated in the current study (176 dyads). Data were collected through the NeoCITIES simulation, which is a simulated task environment of an emergency management team. Team training was manipulated across subjects while environmental condition was manipulated within subjects. Findings indicated that training type had no main effect on team mental models but did have a significant impact on performance. Specifically, dyads exposed to cross-training had higher levels of performance than those that received team coordination training. In addition, team mental models had a significant main effect on performance, such that the increased accuracy and sharedness of situation mental models, the increased sharedness of teamwork mental models, and the increased accuracy of taskwork mental models resulted in higher levels of performance. Surprisingly, the increased sharedness of taskwork mental models was also found to decrease performance. Finally, contrary to previous findings, the effect of team mental models on team performance was not moderated by environmental condition. The results from ancillary analyses evaluating the relationship between team training and performance and team mental models and performance are discussed, along with the limitations and implications of these findings.

T1  - Investigating changes in knowledge frameworks among high school students regarding the Central Dogma of Biology
AN  - 304924251
AB  - Few studies have been conducted of student misconceptions, knowledge frameworks and prior knowledge at the high school level, particularly in the biological sciences. Since a deeper understanding of protein structure and function may allow secondary level students to envision other basic processes of life that are commonly targeted for public debate and decision-making, this study, using an interpretive cross-case study design, was conducted to investigate student conceptions and frameworks concerning the Central Dogma of Biology.    Data sources included interviews, a pre/post-objective test, concept mapping, modified storyboarding and classroom observations. Students improved their basic knowledge of scientific terminology and their ability to make connections between terms and assimilate new terms improved. However, students did not demonstrate ability to recognize the relevance of activities as they connected to the bigger picture of the Central Dogma. New conceptual connections appeared to come from exposure not only to curriculum in the biology class, but also from outside sources like television, health class, and reading. After formal instruction, most student conceptions and frameworks progressed to level of proto-scientific reasoning (as compared to non-scientific or scientific). Implications for biology curriculum, pedagogy and further research are presented.

T1  - Using concept maps to explore preservice teachers' perceptions of science content knowledge, teaching practices, and reflective processes
AN  - 304922282
AB  - This qualitative study examined seven preservice teachers' perceptions of their science content knowledge, teaching practices, and reflective processes through the use of the metacognitive strategy of concept maps. Included in the paper is a review of literature in the areas of preservice teachers' perceptions of teaching, concept development, concept mapping, science content understanding, and reflective process as a part of metacognition.    The key questions addressed include the use of concept maps to indicate organization and understanding of science content, mapping strategies to indicate perceptions of teaching practice, and the influence of concept maps on reflective process. There is also a comparison of preservice teachers' perceptions of concept map usage with the purposes and practices of maps as described by experienced teachers. Data were collected primarily through interviews, observations, a pre and post concept mapping activity, and an analysis of those concept maps using a rubric developed for this study.    Findings showed that concept map usage clarified students' understanding of the organization and relationships within content area and that the process of creating the concept maps increased participants' understanding of the selected content. The participants felt that the visual element of concept mapping was an important factor in improving content understanding. These participants saw benefit in using concept maps as planning tools and as instructional tools. They did not recognize the use of concept maps as assessment tools. When the participants were able to find personal relevance in and through their concept maps they were better able to be reflective about the process. The experienced teachers discussed student understanding and skill development as the primary purpose of concept map usage, while they were able to use concept maps to accomplish multiple purposes in practice.

T1  - Using concept mapping to structure students' views of the school environment's contribution to school violence: Providing suggestions for school environment intervention
AN  - 304914411
AB  - While research has suggested a role for the school environment in the prevention of school violence, this research has primarily been quantitative and the constructs explored derived from theory. In order to create effective school environment interventions there is a need to understand how theory operates in the school context. This study aims to provide this information by asking those most directly affected by school violence, students, their understanding of how the school social and physical environment contributes to the occurrence of school violence.    Students participated in concept mapping, a mixed-methods methodology that captures a group's understanding of a topic through the creation of a conceptual framework. Two groups of Baltimore City high school students participated in the concept mapping process. Participants were asked to brainstorm statement responses to a prompt, sort these statements into piles according to their similarity, and rate each statement for its importance in the initiation, cessation, and severity of school violence. Multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, and participant input were then used to translate these statement piles into an interpretable concept map.    Each group of participants identified over 50 ways that the school environment influences school violence. Six common topics were mentioned by both groups of participants: Student Behaviors, Norms of Behavior, Relationships with School Staff, the Learning Environment, School Safety, and the Neighborhood Environment. The meaning of each topic differed between the groups reflecting each school environment's unique history, location, and student and staff composition. Similar statements and clusters were rated as important for both the initiation and severity of violence. In comparison participants had a more difficult time identifying statements and clusters important for the cessation of school violence.    This study suggests a role for the school environment in the prevention of school violence. School violence interventions should begin to incorporate factors of the school environment as a mechanism to prevent a violent situation from occurring or becoming more serious. The topics identified by both groups as well as the individual statements offer both researchers and educators a starting point for interventions attempting to improve the school environment.

T1  - A concept map-based approach to document indexing and navigation
AN  - 304900262
AB  - With the continued growth of collections of electronic documents stored on personal computers, in corporate networks, and the Internet, we are faced with a daunting challenge. How can we manage this information and access it in an effective way that supports comprehension and makes better use of the knowledge that the electronic documents hold? The problem is critical to many research institutions and governmental and cooperate agencies that accumulate huge quantities of information on technological advances and research results, product designs, business and planning decisions and solutions. This dissertation research investigates the problem of information management and access. It proposes to use concept maps, a structured representation of human knowledge, to facilitate information access and support comprehension. Concept mapping has been used extensively in educational settings as a learning and teaching assessment tools and, more recently, as a knowledge elicitation tool to capture expert knowledge for preservation purposes. The strength of concept mapping lies in its simplicity, by which people of all ages have been able to construct concept maps on a variety of topics to document in a clear and concise form their knowledge for sharing with others. At a pragmatic level, the goal of the dissertation is to develop effective mechanisms to assist humans in navigating and comprehending electronic document libraries using concept maps as an interface through which information is accessed. In pursuit of this goal, the research will focus on models and algorithms to exploit the structure of concept maps and develop navigation and indexing tools to automatically link electronic documents to concept maps to facilitate document understanding and information access.

T1  - Cognitive development in introductory physics: A research-based approach to curriculum reform
AN  - 304880340
AB  - This project describes the research on a classification of physics problems in the context of introductory physics courses. This classification, called the Taxonomy of Introductory Physics Problems (TIPP), relates physics problems to the cognitive processes required to solve them. TIPP was created for designing and clarifying educational objectives, for developing assessments that can evaluate individual component processes of the problem-solving process, and for guiding curriculum design in introductory physics courses, specifically within the context of a “thinking-skills” curriculum. TIPP relies on the following resources: (1) cognitive research findings adopted by physics education research, (2) expert-novice research discoveries acknowledged by physics education research, (3) an educational psychology taxonomy for educational objectives, and (4) various collections of physics problems created by physics education researchers or developed by textbook authors.   TIPP was used in the years 2006–2008 to reform the first semester of the introductory algebra-based physics course (called Phys 11) at The George Washington University. The reform sought to transform our curriculum into a “thinking-skills” curriculum that trades “breadth for depth” by focusing on fewer topics while targeting the students’ cognitive development. We employed existing research on the physics problem-solving expert-novice behavior, cognitive science and behavioral science findings, and educational psychology recommendations.   Our pedagogy relies on didactic constructs such as the GW-ACCESS  problem-solving protocol, learning progressions and concept maps that we have developed and implemented in our introductory physics course. These tools were designed based on TIPP. Their purpose is: (1) to help students build local and global coherent knowledge structures, (2) to develop more context-independent problem-solving abilities, (3) to gain confidence in problem solving, and (4) to establish connections between everyday phenomena and underlying physics concepts. We organize traditional and research-based physics problems such that students experience a gradual increase in complexity related to problem context, problem features and cognitive processes needed to solve the problem. The instructional environment that we designed allows for explicit monitoring, control and measurement of the cognitive processes exercised during the instruction period. It is easily adaptable to any kind of curriculum and can be readily adjusted throughout the semester.   To assess the development of students’ problem-solving abilities, we created rubrics that measure specific aspects of the thinking involved in physics problem solving. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) was administered pre- and post-instruction to determine students’ shift in dispositions towards learning physics. The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was administered pre- and post-instruction to determine students’ level of conceptual understanding. The results feature improvements in students’ problem-solving abilities and in their attitudes towards learning physics.

T1  - Map it: How concept mapping affects understanding of evolutionary processes
AN  - 304854397
AB  - Research question. What impact does a pre-concept map have on the organization of ideas in writing about evolutionary processes?    Subquestions. (1) What effect does the pre-concept map have on student's attitudes towards their ability to write about scientific topics? (2) What are the differences and or similarities between low-achieving and high-achieving students' progress in short essay writing?    Research activities. This research explores the effect of making a concept map prior to writing a short response about an evolutionary process. Context. The study took place in a 9th and 10th grade college preparatory Biology class at a high school in its first year of existence. The school has a four-by-four block schedule where each class runs 90 minutes every day. The research focused on an entire class with three focus students who exemplified above average, average, and below average academic achievement. Methods and data. The intervention lasted a month and utilized concept mapping as the instructional strategy. Three evolutionary processes were discussed during this intervention and for each process a pre-write, concept map, and post-write were conducted. Observational notes were collected during the concept map. The pre- and post-writes were done individually, while the concept map was completed in mixed-ability pairs. Attitudinal surveys were conducted before and after the intervention. Results. There is a correlation between the proficiency and quality of concept maps and of student writing. Findings from the attitudinal data indicated that concept mapping only slightly improved the students' confidence in the ability to write about scientific topics. Student writing improved following the intervention as shown in the post-write proficiency data. Conclusion. The effectiveness of concept mapping depends on the rigor of the content. Concept mapping increases student confidence in the ability to write in general. There was a greater impact on low-achieving students, but concept mapping did not adversely affect high-achieving students' writing.    Grade Level. 9th and 10th grade    Data collection methods.

T1  - Pedagogical and curricular thinking of professional astronomers teaching the Hertzsprung -Russell diagram in introductory astronomy courses for non -science majors
AN  - 304843684
AB  - This qualitative study explores the pedagogical and curricular thinking of five professional astronomers, faculty at a university, about teaching the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram in introductory astronomy courses for non-science majors. Data sources for this study included two semi-structured interviews per participant, in which they were asked about teaching the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, as well as about the introductory course in general. In addition, participants were asked to complete four cognitive tasks; the creation of a lesson plan, a concept map on how they would like their students to think about the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram at the end of the course, a Pathfinder network rating task, and responding to stereotypical student statements regarding the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram.    The data was analyzed using a case study approach, followed by a discussion of themes that emerged from the data. Results indicate that participants had primarily affect and process goals for the course, rather than content goals. In addition, they wanted students to view the HR diagram as a part of a flow chart, where input physics (both observed and inferred properties of stars) leads to the construction of the HR diagram, which in turn is used to make inferences about stellar evolution. Participants identified several student difficulties with the HR diagram, among which interpreting a graph was the most pertinent. In several stereotypical student statements, participants responded using the exact same analogies to explain the concepts to the students. This may be indicative of some underlying pedagogical content knowledge.

T1  - “So I can be a better writer”: Using graphic organizers to enhance procedural writing through home recipes
AN  - 304839261
AB  - Research Question. How do graphic organizers assist third graders in writing a procedural explanation on how to implement a recipe? How do graphic organizers help students organize information to write procedural explanations?   Research Activities. Context. This intervention took place in a self contained 3rd grade classroom composed of 19 students from ethnically and academically diverse backgrounds. The whole class participated in the instructional activities, with additional support given to four English learners (ELs). The four focus students were of Mexican and Hmong background and represented a range of ability on the California English Language Development Test (CELDT). One early advanced, two intermediate and one early intermediate. Focus students were chosen based on CELDT levels and near perfect attendance records. Methods & Data. The intervention occurred in three phases which included recipe activities that mirrored one another. The "hook" was enabling students to create the recipes and eat it in class for two of the three recipes. For the Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich phase and "Ants on a Log" phase first students entered information into a graphic organizer, secondly made the recipe, and lastly wrote a procedural paragraph on the recipe. Students obtained a recipe from home or chose a kid friendly recipe from The Taste of Home Cookbook  in the second phase, after which they filled out a graphic organizer and wrote a procedural paragraph for their recipe. Scaffolds included a step by step presentation for each recipe, teacher modeling of paragraph structure, and class reflections on each activity. Four focus students received additional tutoring and feedback on their recipes. Graphic organizers were scored using a teacher-created rubric targeting the listing of materials, step by step directions and organization. Procedural paragraphs were also scored with a teacher-created rubric focusing on title, correct paragraph format and organization, use of transitional words, correct spelling, mechanics and grammar. Pre and post intervention attitude surveys were administered that related to the students' outlook on writing and school subjects. Observation notes contributed to understanding students' comfort level with writing and enthusiasm for the topic.  Results: Performance was tracked on 12 students with consistent attendance over the course of the intervention for each recipe. Six students' performance improved half or a full point on the rubric scales in their ability to fill out a graphic organizer and write a procedural paragraph while the other half either remained the same or decreased. A similar pattern was seen among the focus students (one student increased a full point, one remained the same but decreased a point on the last recipe, another student fluctuated up and down between half a point and one point, and the last student decreased a full two points). Close analysis of the focus students' recipes over time showed that all made progress in producing key elements of the recipe genre: specifying ingredients, listing step by step procedures in sequence and providing generally replicable recipes despite their rubric based scores. Emergent writer ELs benefited especially from the graphic organizer in maintaining focus in their paragraph writing. After the intervention, three focus students used graphic organizers and scored higher on a district assessment on procedural writing compared to their first assessment as opposed to one focus student who did not and scored lower. Four non-focus students also used graphic organizers on the assessment and scored higher compared to their first writing sample and five who did not use graphic organizers still scored a passing grade. Attitude survey results showed slightly more confidence in one third of the students and no change in the other two thirds of students' ability to write procedural paragraphs. Observation data showed an increase in more than half of the students' willingness to use graphic organizers and to learn other writing genres after the intervention.    Grade Level.

T1  - The use of a metacognitive tool to track learning in science by adults
AN  - 1817100619
AB  - The territory covered by this work includes the response to new information in science by adults. A central aim is to shed some light on the problem of how new and more complex knowledge (specifically conceptual knowledge) develops or arises from old and less complex knowledge. This problem has challenged both philosophers and educators for over twenty centuries. The study draws on perspectives from several academic disciplines, in particular from philosophy, science, and sociology, and to a lesser extent from psychology. These disciplines are used in the first part of the thesis to set the context, both for the problem and for the qualitative research approach which tackles it, as well as to review literature that pertains to the field. Among hindrances to learning that are considered, particular attention is given to difficulties encountered with science texts; trials of some experimental approaches to the problems are included. The central research question concerns how adults learning science respond to new information, especially information that conflicts with their existing knowledge. The problem is approached within a constructivist framework using the metacognitive tool of the concept map as a means of tracking the type of learning (deep or surface) that is taking place. Data relating to the type of learning are also produced through questionnaires and interviews from volunteer participants who are pursuing further and higher education courses that include mandatory science components. The results of the study indicate considerable reluctance to abandon what has been learned previously, in favour of new information. Contrary to expectation was the discovery that adults respond to new information with surface learning strategies, placing extensive reliance (initially at least) on memory, whether or not they declare a preference for meaningful learning. There are implications of this discovery for those who plan and deliver short 'refresher' training courses.

T1  - Peer Review in CS2: The Effects on Attitudes, Engagement, and Conceptual Learning
AN  - 1029875175
AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in a non-programming manner. Peer review provides students with the opportunity to evaluate other people’s work and, in doing so, allows for a rich learning experience. While much is known about peer review and it has many uses in other disciplines, the literature, especially in computer science, does not spend much time on the perspective of and benefits to the reviewer.    In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented, computer science courses as a way to develop the reviewers’ higher-level thinking skills, increase their knowledge of specific programming concepts, and to improve attitudes to help engage them in the activity. Specifically, we explore peer review and its effects on Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation and how the type of review (students reviewing their peers or reviewing materials from their instructor), influences these effects. We also look at how the students’ attitudes relate to their engagement in and the benefits from the reviews.    To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in two CS2 classes at local universities over the course of a semester. We divided the students into three groups where one group reviewed their peers, one group reviewed their instructor, and one group completed small design or coding exercises. We measured the students’ attitudes and their conceptual understanding during the semester with surveys, tests, and concept maps. We collected the completed reviews as well.    We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor’s programs. We did not find evidence of improvements to the students’ level of thinking over the semester nor were there significant changes in their attitudes. However, the data showed that students assigned to review their peers were less likely to complete the assignments than the other students were. Overall, peer reviews are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented programming concepts.

T1  - The application of repertory grid analysis in eliciting conceptual frameworks and classificatory knowledge of biological natural kinds concepts
AN  - 899723149
AB  - This work describes four empirical studies concerning biological natural kind concepts that involve using repertory grid analysis (RGA) as a tool for investigating the structures of representations of these concepts and how students classify them.    Modern RGA is computer-based tool and models of conceptual structures can be represented in graphical form.Â  Protocols were used to compare the conceptual frameworks of a group of individuals, and conceptual change monitored in a rigorous way not possible with customary concept mapping techniques.Â  Convenience samples of senior primary and post-primary students were used in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Valencia; two qualified biologists were retained to provide a base-line comparison. The studies consisted of tasks whereby students were presented with sets of stimuli (the first study which used words, and the others used graphics): (i) one set of five equids and the concept â��goatâ��; (ii) two sets of six equids (consisting of examples drawn from the following three categories: extant, extinct and imaginary); (iii) a large set of mammals; and (iv) five sets of dicotyledonous plant families.Â  Grids of rankings were elicited from the studentsâ�� interaction with the stimuli and these were subjected to mathematical procedures such as principal components analysis and cluster analysis.    Findings point to the rich reality of the studentsâ�� understanding of the living world and therefore how practitioners can investigate such understanding using RGA.

T1  - Conceptual change in pre -service science teachers' views on nature of science when learning a unit on the physics of waves
AN  - 89137339
AB  - Recent reform efforts in science education have culminated in National Science Education Standards (NSES), which include the nature of science and science inquiry themes across all grade levels. Consideration must be given to pre-service science teachers’ nature of science conceptions and their perceived roles in implementing the nature of science in the science classroom. This qualitative study investigates how pre-service science teachers’ views about the nature of science develop and change when learning a college physics unit on waves in an urban university.    The study uses case study methodology with four pre-service science teachers as individual units of analysis. Data regarding the participants’ views about the nature of science were collected before and after the instruction on the physics of waves unit. The research design used ‘The Views of Nature of Science/Views of Scientific Inquiry-Physics Questionnaire’ followed by structured interviews throughout the wave unit. In addition, the participants responded to daily questions that incorporated nature of science themes and constructed concept maps regarding the physics content and their nature of science understanding.    After completing the VNOS/VOSI-PHYS questionnaire the pre-service science teachers’ views of the nature of science were found to be mainly naïve and transitional before the instruction. At the end of the wave unit instruction, the data indicated that conceptual change occurred in participants’ nature of science views, shifting toward informed views. The findings of this study provide evidence that using explicit instruction with specific activities, such as experiments and concept mapping, shifted the pre-service science teachers’ views away from naïve and toward informed.

T1  - Assessing mind maps as an aide to career planning
AN  - 304837931
AB  - Attracting, developing, and retaining key employees are critical business imperatives today. Many segments of business already face a potentially serious shortage of workers with critical skills, and this problem is expected to become more acute in the coming decades (Conway, 2007; Powers, 2007). This skills shortage could jeopardize the survival of many businesses unless steps are taken to address this issue (May, 2006). One of the best ways for firms to ensure they will have employees with the necessary technical and business skills in the future is to focus on providing better career development and career planning opportunities for their current employees (Kirton, 2006). While the critical role career development will play in the future success of many firms has been well established, surprisingly little research has been done on specifically what types of tools, techniques, or processes lead to the most effective career development plans. In this research, one potential career planning aid, mind mapping, is examined to determine whether it can be an effective aid to those creating career plans or making career decisions.    To assess the effectiveness of mind mapping as an aid to career planning, a quasi-experiment was conducted with students in a college career development class. All subjects were first given two common commercially available tests designed to measure their career decision making ability. Next the experiment group was given several hours of training in mind mapping and shown how mind mapping techniques could be used to aid in career planning and general decision making. Finally both groups were retested to determine if the experiment group showed significantly greater improvement than the control group. In addition to testing for the effect of mind mapping this study also included the examination of correlations between a number of demographic variables and scores on the two test instruments.

T1  - A comparative study of the effect of collaborative problem -solving in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) on individual achievement
AN  - 304825929
AB  - Since the early 2000s, significant attention has been given to the academic potential of a new type of online game called Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) that take place in 3-dimensional (3D) immersive persistent worlds. MMOGs are believed to hold significant promise for educators because they provide for the player (learner) rich learning opportunities that exemplify quality-learning experiences but there is little empirical research and published work on MMOGs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of collaborative problem solving during MMOG play on the individual achievement (posttest and concept-map construction scores) of 159 sixth-grade students. There were four comparison groups of existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=100): two taught by the researcher and two taught by the regular sixth-grade science teacher and an experimental group of two existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=59) taught by the researcher. During the 8-day investigation, the experimental group played Web Earth Online, an ecology-based MMOG, and the comparison group received traditional instruction that included multimedia-rich, hands-on, collaborative activities to learn about the life cycle and survival needs of the Eastern Bluebird. A content analysis of the log files of player dialog to assess player collaborative teamwork during MMOG play was utilized. A dependent-samples t test and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to examine the differences in performance between the experimental and comparison groups on the content knowledge assessment and concept-map construction task. A correlation of frequencies was utilized to examine the relationship between collaborative teamwork-strategy scores of students in the MMOG group and posttest and concept-map scores. Satisfaction surveys were administered to examine game and unit satisfaction.    Results of the analysis showed that individuals who participated in the experimental group tended to have statistically significant lower  posttest scores than students in the comparison group taught by the researcher (based on the 33-item test results) or in the comparison group taught by the teacher (based on the more reliable 17-item test results). Although no statistically significant differences were found in the scores from the experimental group, a statistically significant difference between pre- and posttest was found for the whole sample. Descriptive statistics indicated that learning growth occurred in both groups as evidenced by the pre-and posttest difference in means.    Moreover, nonsignificant differences among the three groups in terms of concept-map scores were observed. An analysis of the chat log files of the MMOG participants revealed that only 30% of the chats involved collaboration, with the more common strategies being Communication, Leadership, and Interpersonal. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between usage of Leadership strategies and posttest scores. Findings from correlation results show that there is a high degree of interitem correlation between the collaborative strategies identified for the study from the chat log files of the experimental group.    The percentage of responses of agree and strongly agree that participants learned from the MMOG and the instructional unit are 82%, 58%, and 75% for experimental, researcher's comparison, and teacher's comparison, respectively, with the experimental students overwhelmingly indicated they learned about the Eastern Bluebird.    The findings from this study suggested that the educational use of video games, specifically MMOGs, can be a viable pedagogical strategy. Results indicated that Web Earth Online was engaging and motivating for students and that the study indicated that concept maps are appropriate instruments to measure learning in a MMOG. Because of the growth in learning in both groups a claim can be made that the rich learning experiences in the comparison groups provided a situated-learning environment (authentic context, authentic activities, authentic assessment, expert modeling, and situated mentoring) that was very similar to the experiences of students in the experimental groups.

AN  - 304817477
AB  - The Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck is one of the oldest problems of knowledge-based systems in general and of computer-based training in particular. The aim of the this thesis is mainly to tackle the issue of knowledge acquisition and exploitation for computer training purposes by offering an integrated framework that enables knowledge extraction from texts and its dissemination for training purposes.Knowledge acquisition is performed over plain text documents and aims at learning and populating a domain ontology from texts using statistics, machine learning and natural language processing. The learning methodology proposed here can be used for any domain and any application. However, one interesting aspect is that it provides intermediate structures in the form of concept maps that can be useful for training.In fact, the second main objective of this thesis is to provide a bridge between the different computer-based training communities and especially the intelligent tutoring system community and the e-Learning community. Through a common knowledge base, and a common ontological framework, our system "The Knowledge Puzzle" is able to automatically compose new learning resources dubbed Learning Knowledge Objects (LKOs). These LKOs can be exploited by any training system and have some interesting characteristics: they are active, theory-aware, and content-aware and they have a set of services to act on their knowledge base. We also provide standardization mechanisms to enable the LKOs to be launched in standard e-Learning environments such as SCORM and IMS-LD.

T1  - Analysis of the psychometric properties of two different concept -map assessment tasks
AN  - 304692504
AB  - The ability to make sense of a wide array of stimuli presupposes the human tendency to organize information in a meaningful way. Efforts to assess the degree to which students organize information meaningfully have been hampered by several factors including the idiosyncratic way in which individuals represent their knowledge either with words or visually. Concept maps have been used as tools by researchers and educators alike to assist students in understanding the conceptual interrelationships within a subject domain. One concept-map assessment in particular known as the construct-a-map task has shown great promise in facilitating reliable and valid inferences from student concept-map ratings. With all of its promise, however, the construct-a-map task is burdened with several rating difficulties. One challenge in particular is that no published rubric has been developed that accounts for the degree to which individual propositions are important to an understanding of the overall topic or theme of the map. This study represents an attempt to examine the psychometric properties of two construct-a-map tasks designed to overcome in part this rating difficulty.    The reliability of the concept-map ratings was calculated using a person-by-rater-by-occasion fully crossed design. This design made it possible to use generalizability theory to identify and estimate the variance in the ratings contributed by the three factors mentioned, the interaction effects, and unexplained error. The criterion validity of the concept-map ratings was examined by computing Pearson correlations between concept-map and essay ratings and concept-map and interview transcript ratings.    The generalizability coefficients for student mean ratings were moderate to very high: .73 and .94 for the first concept-mapping task and .74 and .87 for the second concept-mapping task. A relatively large percentage of the rating variability was contributed by the object of measurement. Both tasks correlated highly with essay and interview ratings: .62 to .81.

T1  - Using rock art as an alternative science pedagogy
AN  - 304686206
AB  - College-level and seventh-grade science students were studied to understand the power of a field index, the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI), for student learning about complex biophysical environmental processes. In order to determine if the studied population was representative, 584 college and seventh-grade students undertook a concept mapping exercise after they had learned basic weathering science via in-class lecture. Of this large group, a subset of 322 college students and 13 seventh-grade students also learned RASI through a field experience involving the analysis of rock weathering associated with petroglyphs. After learning weathering through RASI, students completed another concept map. This was a college population where roughly 46% had never taken a "lab science" course and nearly 22% were from minority (non-white) populations.    Analysis of student learning through the lens of actor-network theory revealed that when landscape is viewed as process (i.e. many practices), science education embodies both an alternative science philosophy and an alternative materialistic worldview. When RASI components were analyzed after only lecture, student understanding of weathering displayed little connection between weathering form and weathering process. After using RASI in the field however, nearly all students made illustrative concept maps rich in connections between weathering form and weathering process for all subcomponents of RASI.    When taken as an aggregate, and measured by an average concept map score, learning increased by almost 14%, Among college minority students, the average score increase approached 23%. Among female students, the average score increase was 16%. For seventh-grade students, scores increased by nearly 36%. After testing for normalcy with Kolmogorov-Smirnov, t-tests reveal that all of these increases were highly statistically significant at p<0.001. The growth in learning weathering science by minority students, as compared to non-minority students, was also statistically significant at p<0.01. These findings reveal the power of field work through RASI to strengthen cognitive linkages between complex biophysical processes and the corresponding rock weathering forms.

T1  - Integrating holistic nursing at the University of Delaware
AN  - 304634862
AB  - There is growing concern whether health care providers are adequately prepared to address the safety and needs of clients related to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Nursing faculty have limited knowledge to teach CAM content. Student nurses must be adequately prepared to pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX). This project constructs a conceptual framework for integrating holistic nursing and CAM into the curriculum at the University of Delaware. A concept map develops the components of the plan and outlines the steps of the process. The plan is based on a review of the literature, and surveys and interviews of faculty and students to discover best practices.    Chapter One consists of identifying the problem and supporting the argument through a review of the literature. In this chapter the main problems of increased consumer use and the lack of CAM content in the curriculum are discussed. In addition, recommendations from accrediting bodies and professional organizations are provided. The overall plan of the project is presented.    Chapter Two presents the results of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices about CAM of faculty and students. In addition, in-person interviews with faculty about the role of CAM in their courses are discussed.    Chapter Three presents the design of the proposed integration plan. The plan provides a matrix that outlines where holistic CAM content should be integrated into the curriculum. Strategies for successful implementation are discussed. A professional development course plan for faculty about CAM was created. Adult learning principles and use of technology in teaching were investigated. Lastly, an evaluation plan is provided to determine the success of the project. The design of the professional development course was informed from the results of the survey and through a review of the literature.    This project serves as a plan for future integration of holistic nursing in schools of nursing in the State of Delaware. A grant has been obtained to continue this work. Lessons learned and changes required during the integration will serve as important information in the refinement of this process. This conceptual framework will serve as the basis for continued opportunities.

T1  - The context, factors and pathways related to adolescent sexuality in Lima, Peru
AN  - 304618241
AB  - Background. Existing research on adolescent sexuality in Peru has limitations that have led to gaps in knowledge. The objective of this study was to better understand adolescent sexuality by using a mixed method approach to access adolescent perspectives in Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, a peripheral area of Lima.    Purpose. The qualitative research aims were: (1) to enable adolescents to narrate their lives to date; (2) to enable adolescents to locate sexuality within the broader context of their lives; (3) to identify and describe individual- and societal-level items and clusters of items that adolescents perceive to be related to adolescent sexuality, and to explore the importance of the items for sexuality-related outcomes; and (4) to understand the adolescent-chosen pathways from the clusters to having sex.    The quantitative research aims were: (1) to analyze the factor structure and internal consistency reliability of seven scales; and (2) to examine the association between the scales and precoital behaviors and vaginal sex.    Methods. First, life history interviews were conducted with twenty purposively-selected 12–17 year old females and males. Next, concept mapping sessions were carried out with 63 randomly-selected 15–17 year olds. Participants brainstormed items related to adolescent sexuality, sorted these items into clusters and rated each item on its importance to sexuality-related outcomes, and created a pathway from the clusters of items to having sex. Finally, a survey was carried out with 300 randomly-selected 15–17 year olds to validate the concept mapping results.    Results. The life history interviews detailed the complex lives of adolescents, including personal responsibilities, family problems, emotional and social pressures, economic struggles, racism and violence. Although sexuality is present in adolescents' lives, many narrators view the complete expression of their sexuality as a constrained choice.    Concept mapping provided important new factors, and new perspectives on previously-recognized factors, that influence adolescent sexuality. Individual-level items include self-respect, honesty and responsibility, personal will and individual thoughts and other items include family dynamics, connectedness with peers, teachers and the community, and partner relationships. The pathways to having sex include the causes and consequences of having sex, the close environment and partners.    The quantitative component produced seven new scales for measuring factors associated with adolescent sexuality: self-image, achievements for the future, family education, peer relationships, teacher connectedness, individual thoughts, and partner relationships. All of the scales have high internal reliability and many were positively associated with vaginal sex or precoital behaviors.    Conclusions. This thesis provided a comprehensive understanding of adolescent sexuality in Lima, Peru. The qualitative methodologies offered an in-depth view of adolescent perspectives on the context, factors and pathways driving sexuality. The quantitative component validated the qualitative results and tested the association between psychosocial measures and sexual behaviors. These findings represent important insights for future research, programs and policies for adolescents in Peru.

T1  - The walk of life: Stress in the lives of school superintendents in Central Illinois
AN  - 304606363
AB  - The purpose of this study and research was to provide a descriptive and holistic study of stressors in the superintendency and find out how practicing superintendents respond to and manage stress.   The research in this qualitative research study was presented in narrative form. This methodology is founded on the evidence that individuals make sense of their lives and world according to the stories that they have developed to illustrate it. The use of stories or narratives allows the reader to contemplate their own personal experiences and to learn about others within our world. Stories also mark historical events, add to the culture of the area being studied and to our understanding. The stories were based upon extensive interviews and used as case studies toward data analysis. Qualitative research tools of concept mapping, decoding, distinctions of the participants and cross member checking were done within this study. Theory triangulation of the data was used along with the narratives as case studies to interpret and analyze toward a single set of data.   Major questions involved in this study of stress and the superintendency were: What were the perceived stressors of the participants in the study? How were the participants affected by stress? What were the participating superintendents doing to cope with stress.   The evolution and context of this dissertation and its research were portrayed through the stories or narratives section. The stories illustrated the objectives of the research, exemplified the selection of the participating members, and engraved the responses and feelings of the participating school superintendents of small, medium and large school districts. Also, the stories depicted the perceived stressors and coping techniques used by the participants in this research study. Their life stories represent highlights and case studies that then yielded an interpretive ethnographical portrayal of the stress in the lives of the superintendency. The narratives or stories became case studies and exhibited and identified some of the main stressors they face in their jobs and lives, the effects, and their ways of coping with stress both positively and negatively.   The perceived stressors, affects of stress, and what the practicing superintendents did to cope were brought out in this study. The study could be utilized to more effectively understand and cope with stress.

T1  - Scientific concept development in the English Language Arts classroom
AN  - 304496274
AB  - This study uses discourse analysis to examine how scientific concepts (Vygotsky, 1997) develop in an English Language Arts class over the course of one curricular unit. The study focuses on how two students in one 12 th grade English Language Arts classroom develop towards the scientific concept of summary. The study examines the teacher’s classroom discussion of the concept of summary, and the students’ development of the concept of summary. The development is investigated using Systemic Functional Linguistics to analyze the classroom and interview talk from both teacher and students. The use of concept mapping and SFL analysis (Halliday, 1994) focus on transitivity, interpersonal metaphor, and clause linking devices to enhance, elaborate, or expand the concept’s web of relations. Understanding the initial developmental level of the concept helped to examine how the teacher’s discourse surrounding the concept mediated the concept of summary. Language and schooling as a part of the teaching and learning context and pedagogical issues are discussed.

T1  - Work-based self -esteem: Conceptual, theoretical, and scale development and model testing
AN  - 304475286
AB  - My dissertation explores and proposes measures for distinct and differentiated elements of individuals' self-esteem at work. Conceptual and theoretical development revealed that work-based self-esteem contains multiple elements, each of which has different antecedents and outcomes. Concept mapping, which captures the phenomenological aspects of work based self esteem as actually experienced by workers, confirmed this argument. I found that work-based self-esteem is derived from workers' view of themselves based on their (1) performance, (2) work roles, (3) social interactions at work, (4) the organization itself, and (5) occupation. Using survey data from workers, I developed measures for each of these elements using standard construct development protocols. Using an independent sample of workers and their peers and supervisors, the hypotheses were confirmed that these elements have different correlates (such as extra-role behaviors) in the nomological network developed in my conceptual and theoretical arguments. My dissertation provides a platform for further theoretical and empirical work on work-based self-esteem and intrinsic motivation.

T1  - Competent membership and persistence for Asian American students at a single institution
AN  - 304467306
AB  - Tinto's explanation of the relationship between social integration and persistence is not race neutral; it assumes a dominant mainstream culture for every student. Past empirical assessments of social integration and the likelihood of persistence lacked cultural context for other cultural groups leading to inconsistent outcomes. The concept of competent membership was used as an alternative to social integration. Focus groups and concept mapping assisted in defining competent membership and persistence within a cultural perspective. A survey was developed to test the relationship between competent membership and persistence for Asian American students at the University of Utah. Survey results displayed a linear relationship between competent membership and the likelihood of persistence. Suggestions to improve opportunities for students to build competent memberships were included.

T1  - Concept mapping to promote meaningful learning at the community college level
AN  - 304385674
AB  - This concurrent, mixed method study explored the effectiveness of concept mapping and collaborative groups in promoting understanding of ecology at the community college level. The research problems being addressed included students' need to meaningfully understand the relevance of human's effects on the environment and teachers' needs to find engaging, active strategies that promote permanent integration of knowledge by their pupils. The key research questions investigate group versus individual map construction and its effect on understanding and map quality improvement. Prior research shows conflicting conclusions related to mapping and group success and very little research has been conducted looking at map quality through practice. Students from two sections of human ecology were assessed of their ecology understanding by a pre- and posttest design over a semester and also first and last concept maps were collected and assessed. The study results showed no statistically significant difference (using a t test) between (a) posttest scores of students individually constructing maps compared to students who constructed in groups and (b) map quality from beginning to the end of the semester between the individual and group constructors. During the data analysis, all students collectively showed a significant improvement from pre- to posttest scores. Improved quality of maps constructed from the beginning to the end of the semester of all students was not supported quantitatively, but the qualitative analysis showed some overall improvement. Social change will come from providing accurate knowledge for students to use for decisions related to environmental problems and by creating more critical thinkers because of a variety of learning strategies in schools, as well as teachers' increased use of concept mapping for improved student learning.

T1  - The effects of students' asynchronous online discussions of conceptual errors on intentionally flawed teacher-constructed concept maps
AN  - 304380674
AB  - Research shows that online discussions are often unfocused and without providing much benefit to students' learning outcomes. One of the reasons behind this phenomenon is the lack of or inadequate scaffolding or guidance provided to students when participating on asynchronous discussion boards. The collaborative misconception mapping strategy is a tool that was designed to mediate cognitive and metacognitive processes via feedback provided by peers and a teacher-created concept map that contains intentional conceptual errors.    This study evaluated the effects of collaborative misconception mapping as compared with those of a traditional online discussion activity, where students post responses to discussion questions. Subjects were 52 undergraduate students in health sciences statistics classes at a large southwestern urban university; 24 in the misconception mapping group and 29 in the traditional discussion group. The level of meaningfulness of students' discussions using a rubric based on an intentional conceptual change model, and their post-test scores were compared. In addition, utilizing mean scores on the Metacognitive Self-regulation subscale of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ), the collaborative misconception mapping strategy's effectiveness for students with low self-regulation skills was investigated. Findings indicate that the misconception mapping strategy outperforms the traditional discussion tool, as it provides a self-regulatory scaffold to students, and improves learning outcomes even for those with low levels of self-regulation. The strategy also enhances the meaningfulness of discussions in terms of their reflection of cognitive and metacognitive processes, and promotes more positive learner perceptions regarding the tool itself. It is recommended that instructors reevaluate their online discussion requirements, consider the negative impact unguided online discussions may have on their students' online learning experience, and provide appropriate cognitive and metacognitive scaffolding for optimal learning outcomes.

T1  - The evolving practitioner: A qualitative inquiry into reflections on teacher perspectives in a professional development program in higher education
AN  - 304349881
AB  - Teachers' perspectives on teaching and learning in higher education have been identified as a critical area of research. This qualitative study was designed to answer the following question: How does reflecting on teaching and learning within a two year period in a professional development program (the Master Teacher Program, or MTP) contribute (or not) to teachers' changing perspectives on teaching and learning? I interviewed six Quebec CEGEP (college) teachers on five different occasions, as they completed the first four courses in the MTP. The participants were female, taught in different disciplines, programs, and colleges, and had various years of teaching experience. Repeated, semi-structured interviews were analyzed, using the dual processes of categorizing and connecting (Maxwell & Miller, in press). Results converged to reveal four patterns and three major dimensions. Through categorizing, four patterns emerged that described a process of movement from teacher to learner-centeredness. I used the four metaphors of awakening, stretching, exercising, and shaping to represent these four patterns. Furthermore, I corroborated these findings by examining participants' concept maps and their reflective journals. I found additional evidence for the four patterns in the narrative summaries that I constructed, using connecting strategies. These narratives also exposed some of the more contextualized aspects of the evolution in teacher perspectives. In addition to the four patterns, three major dimensions related to teacher perspectives emerged. The participants reported that they had become more aware of the learner and the learning process, more intentional in curriculum planning and teaching, and they increased in self-knowledge, and in particular, in their sense of identity as teacher professionals. Reflection on practice functioned as a major factor underlying changes in perspectives. Time was also a significant factor. Findings showed that it took at least one year for most of the participants to link theory with practice, before they reported implementing changes in pedagogy. Therefore, changes in perspectives preceded changes in practice. The results of this study suggest that professional development programs, such as the MTP, can help teachers evolve as effective practitioners. Moreover, such programs can also help to foster a sense of professional identity among teachers in higher education. Future research can further clarify relationships among perspectives, teaching experience, and disciplinary background, and continue to explore incentives for teachers in higher education to participate in professional development.

T1  - Weight bias in pediatric healthcare providers: An exploratory study using photo elicitation with focus groups
AN  - 304341650
AB  - The prevalence of overweight and obese children is increasing, posing a challenge for pediatric healthcare providers designing care for this population. Overweight and obese children and adolescents experience many of the same physical and psychosocial problems as overweight adults, including weight bias. Little is known about weight bias toward children among pediatric healthcare providers.    To explore weight bias toward children among pediatric healthcare providers when assessing and planning care, two aims were addressed: (a) to describe the attitudes and beliefs of pediatric healthcare providers toward children depicted as normal weight or obese; and (b) to describe the ways healthcare providers demonstrate weight bias when planning health care for children depicted as normal weight or obese.    Using a qualitative descriptive design with photo elicitation, audio-recorded focus-group interviews were held with 27 pediatric healthcare providers (nurse practitioners and physicians). Provider responses to sketches of normal weight and overweight twelve-year-old male and female children were elicited. Sketches were accompanied by standardized scenarios indicating a well child sports physical exam. Five focus groups were held in several offices of a large northwestern health-maintenance organization. Transcribed data were analyzed using ATLAS-ti to identify codes and categories in the data.    Two themes were identified: (a) Pediatric healthcare providers emphasized weight-related concerns in their assessment and care of overweight female patients and de-emphasized weight in their consideration of overweight male care planning; and (b) In articulating plans of care for 12-year old children, providers develop more complex plans of care for overweight children that diminish the emphasis on typical, age-appropriate risk assessment and counseling in favor of weight-related assessments and interventions. Categorical and concept map analysis demonstrated that sexuality was discussed within the normal-weight but not the overweight scenarios. Eating disorders was discussed within normal-weight female exams while beliefs  that height catches up to weight were observed with overweight male scenarios, implying overweight males may outgrow obesity. Barriers to change such as family eating patterns, living in an unsafe neighborhood and parental attitudes were identified in the overweight male and female scenarios. Knowledge discovered can inform pediatric practice, education and nursing research.

T1  - Effects of the use of thematic organizers in conjunction with concept mapping on learning, misconceptions, and retention in middle school science class
AN  - 304339706
AB  - This study was devised to determine effects of the use of interactive thematic organizers and concept maps in middle school science classes during a unit study on minerals. The design, a pretest-posttest control group, consisted of matched groups (three experimental groups and one comparison group). It also included a student survey assessing qualitative aspects of the investigation.    The 67 6th-grade students and one science teacher who participated in the study were from an independent K-12 school. Students represented a normal, well-distributed range of abilities. Group I (control) proceeded with their usual method of studying a unit—reading aloud the text and answering workbook questions. Group II worked with interactive thematic organizers, designed to activate prior knowledge and help students make inferences about target concepts in three treatments. Group III created three interactive concept maps, which represented both understandings and misconceptions. Concept maps were reviewed and repaired as students completed each treatment. Group IV participated in both thematic organizer and concept map treatments.   Statistical analyses were determined through a pretest and a delayed recall posttest essay for all four groups. Two scores were assigned—one quantitative raw score of correct explicit answers and one rubric score based on the quality of interpretive responses. Group II also received scores for thematic organizer responses. Group III received rubric scores for concept maps. Group IV received all possible scores. Paired t-tests reported comparisons of scores across the treatment groups. A linear regression indicated whether or not concept map misconceptions affected posttest scores. Finally, an ANCOVA reported statistical significance across the four treatment groups.   Findings of data analysis indicated statistically significant improvement in posttest scores among students in the three experimental groups. Students who participated in both treatments represented the highest scores among the four groups. Results of the ANCOVA indicated there was statistically significant difference in scores among the four treatments.   Recommendations were made to further investigate development of interactive thematic organizers with student-chosen hyperlinks to concepts, as well as a recommendation that researchers investigate teacher understandings of interpretive purpose and form in the creation of thematic organizers.

T1  - Impact of an integrated science and reading intervention (INSCIREAD) on bilingual students' misconceptions, reading comprehension, and transferability of strategies
AN  - 304325401
AB  - This thesis describes a research study that resulted in an instructional model directed at helping fourth grade diverse students improve their science knowledge, their reading comprehension, their awareness of the relationship between science and reading, and their ability to transfer strategies. The focus of the instructional model emerged from the intersection of constructs in science and reading literacy; the model identifies cognitive strategies that can be used in science and reading, and inquiry-based instruction related to the science content read by participants. The intervention is termed  INSCIREAD (Instruction in Science and Reading). The GoInquire  web-based system (2006) was used to develop students’ content knowledge in slow landform change.   Seventy-eight students participated in the study. The treatment group comprised 49 students without disabilities and 8 students with disabilities. The control group comprised 21 students without disabilities. The design of the study is a combination of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design (Study 1), and a single subject design with groups as the unit of analysis (Study 2).   The results from the quantitative measures demonstrated that the text recall data analysis from Study 1 yielded near significant statistical levels when comparing the performance of students without disabilities in the treatment group to that of the control group. Visual analyses of the results from the text recall data from Study 2 showed at least minimal change in all groups.    The results of the data analysis of the level of the generated questions show there was a statistically significant increase in the scores students without disabilities obtained in the questions they generated from the pre to the posttest. The analyses conducted to detect incongruities, to summarize and rate importance, and to determine the number of propositions on a science and reading concept map data showed a statistically significant difference between students without disabilities in the treatment and the control groups on post-intervention scores.   The analysis of the data from the number of misconceptions of students without disabilities showed that the frequency of 4 of the 11 misconceptions changed significantly from pre to post elicitation stages. The analyses of the qualitative measures of the think alouds and interviews generally supported the above findings.

T1  - Structural assessment of knowledge for misconceptions in the domain of physics
AN  - 304324277
AB  - Unlike textual description, pathfinder network (an algorithm that results in a kind of concept map) provides a visual way to describe the knowledge structure of a student. It often provides a clear measure of the student's understanding and highlights the student's misconceptions. The traditional approaches of assessment such as multiple-choice questions and word problems often fail to identify these misconceptions. The following steps were carried out for this study. 1. The study assessed the knowledge structures of grade 11 physics students of a public high school of Ottawa and their instructor using pathfinder networks. The work concept (a subset of links around the concept of work) in the students' pathfinder networks was compared to the work concept in the referent network and the similarity between them was calculated. 2. During the intervention phase of the study, individualized instructions and exercises based on the misconceptions about the concept of work, shown by their knowledge structures, were given to the students. 3. The study again assessed the knowledge structures of the students for a change in work concept in their pathfinder networks by comparing it with the referent network. The study also analyzed the control concepts of "mass" and "gravity" in the pathfinder networks of the students and found no significant change in those.    In addition to pathfinder networks' utility as a global measure of conceptual knowledge of the students, which is useful for summative assessment, this research is a step forward to provide evidence that an individual node in the pathfinder network can be explored to study a particular concept in the network. Therefore, the research demonstrates the potential utility of pathfinder networks for formative assessment. This offers the possibility of providing the students with extremely comprehensive feedback.    Results revealed that the similarity index of work concept in the pathfinder networks of the students increased from pre- to post-intervention phase. Most likely, the major reason for this change was that individualized instructions were given to each student about the concept of work which stimulated and probably changed some of their misconceptions. To address validity, the similarity indices of mass and gravity concepts in the pathfinder networks of the students were also checked for improvement. The result shows that there is no significant improvement in mass and gravity concepts as the individualised instructions were not given to the students about mass and gravity concepts. Findings support the use of structural assessment of knowledge with pathfinder scaling technique for formative assessment as a way to enhance learning.

T1  - The effect of an STC orientation to teaching on student academic performance and motivation in secondary earth science
AN  - 288097999
AB  - Student achievement gaps among subgroups remain a prevalent and critical issue in urban education systems. In many classes these students remain the target—and often the victims—of test-driven curriculum. Missing from their urban education is one of the most important aspects of a true education: a sense of place within that education. Science educators and educational researchers might consider the benefits of Sociotransformative Constructivism (STC) as a means of creating a more meaningful education for urban youth. This study examined the impact of an STC teaching orientation on student motivation and academic performance in secondary earth science students. The mixed methodology employed used both qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection consisted of STC activities, survey data, classroom observations, studentgenerated work and threaded discussions. Statistical analysis included independent t-tests of pre- and post-instruction concept maps. The results showed that the adaptation of an STC teaching orientation has a positive impact on student motivation and performance in secondary earth science.

T1  - Generating conceptually personalized interactions for educational digital libraries using concept maps
AN  - 275963788
AB  - Personalized or one-to-one instruction holds great potential for improving the state of education. But due to lack of good teachers this goal can only be approximated with the help of new and innovative computational technology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to improve the state of education by aiming to support personalized student interaction with online learning environments in formal and informal educational settings by developing methods and techniques that are scalable, domain neutral, and can be used with open ended student inquiries. In particular this research focuses on conceptual personalization of interaction within online learning environments based on student and domain concept maps which are used as the semi-formal knowledge representation scheme. To address the conceptual personalization agenda three activities were carried out during the course of this research: (1) Assessment study, (2) Algorithm design implementation, and (3) Adaptive learning environments prototyping. In the assessment study, cognitive process of human experts were analyzed to understand operations used by human when assessing student understanding by comparing a student concept map to the domain concept map. The synthesized operations were then used to guide the development of algorithms that can automatically assess student conceptual understanding from their concept map. Lastly, the results from the automatic student assessment were embedded into task specific adaptive learning environments.

T1  - An evaluation of meaningful learning in a high school chemistry course
AN  - 275547758
AB  - This study utilized an action research methodology to examine students' understandings of science knowledge, and meaningful learning using the SLD (Science Lecture Demonstration) and laboratory instructional method in a high school chemistry classroom. This method was a modification of the Science Lecture Demonstration Method as developed by Majerich and Schmuckler (2004, in press), the modification due to the addition of a laboratory component. The participants in this study represented a convenience sample which included one class of twenty-two, middle to high socio-economic status students (Mean family income over $75,000/year in 2005 U.S. dollars) in an honors chemistry course at a public high school in the state of New Jersey. These participants included nine girls and thirteen boys.   The results of this study indicated what the students' understandings of science knowledge were, how the understandings differed among students, and to what extent those understandings were indicative of meaningful learning. These results were obtained by careful analysis of student generated concept maps, narratives from demonstration quizzes, laboratory reports, and test questions, as well as a teacher/researcher reflection upon the classroom experience. A simple taxonomy for analyzing students' understandings of science knowledge was developed, based upon the work of Majerich (2004). Findings indicated that the students' understanding of science knowledge, as well as the extent of meaningful learning that occurs in the chemistry classroom may be influenced by the roles of: explicit directions, pre-existing knowledge from elementary and middle school science classes, using examples vs. non-examples, macroscopic vs. microscopic views of nature, time for reflection, and everyday vs. scientific language. Results obtained from high school student responses confirmed Novak's observation of elementary students' lack of differentiation between the terms vapor and gas (Novak, 1998).

T1  - The Effects of Cross-Age Mentoring in an Online Collaborative Environment
AN  - 2674876039
AB  - This mixed method research was designed to examine the effects of cross-age mentoring in an inter-institutional online learning community. The research questions focused on the impact of mentoring on high school students’ confidence in their information seeking skills, perceptions of their information seeking standards, and the application of these standards to an information seeking task. Also of interest was the dialogic interaction between the students at the two sites, the impact of the facilitator on the process, and the university students’ perceptions about their experience.The participants included 26 students (mentees) enrolled in an American history class at a rural high school and 18 pre-service teachers (mentors) enrolled in an introductory educational technology course. Mentoring groups comprised of four-five high school students and three-four pre-service teachers interacted via a synchronous online courseware system. Both classes met at the same time of the day, twice weekly, allowing for synchronous interactions. The project was implemented over a five week period during which pre- and post-tests of information seeking confidence and standards were administered and students were engaged in their information seeking tasks. During the course of the project the online interactions were archived and saved for later analysis.Results revealed that there was no change in the high school students’ confidence in their information seeking abilities. The assessment of their evaluative standards revealed that they became more aware of the importance of evaluating the accuracy of information they located. In addition, a positive correlation was found between their understandings of the importance of evaluating information to determine its relevance to the task at hand and the disposition toward a more expert approach to seeking information. Performance on the information seeking task was positively influenced by conceptual scaffolding provided by both the facilitator and the pre-service teachers. Feedback that encouraged the high school students to consider conceptual issues was discovered to be most effective. The findings from this research contribute to the literature on cross-age mentoring between higher education and K-12 students as well as providing insights about strategies that influence students’ abilities to locate, evaluate, and synthesize information.

T1  - Show and tell: Learning with interactive videoconferencing in kindergarten
AN  - 231440420
AB  - The research investigated how kindergartners make meaning using interactive videoconferencing. The study explored two research questions: (1) What types of meanings are being formed by the kindergartners during interactive videoconferences and, (2) What are the nature of young children's emerging inquiries and dialogue surrounding their use of interactive videoconferencing in their classroom? The study embodied a Vygotskian perspective as the theoretical framework in order to meet demands associated with the young participants' vulnerability, developmental appropriateness, and the students' interactive learning environment. Employing an ethnographic, participant observation methodology, the research design was informed by three criteria: (1) a pilot study, (2) Miles and Huberman's (1994a) recurring themes in qualitative data analysis, and (3) literature review results emphasizing the nuances of contemporary culture. Field observation occurred from October 2007 through February 2008 in a Southwestern Pennsylvania kindergarten classroom. Students participated in 7 videoconferences with distant peers or content experts. Data from a gingerbread and puppetry videoconference and an astronomy program were selected for further analysis based on their ability to illustrate poignant examples of how the kindergartners formed meaning during collaborations. Data analysis procedures involved the importing of dialogue from videoconferencing transcriptions, field notes, and other artifacts into the ATLAS.ti qualitative data analysis software for open coding, data display, and grounded theory development.    Results developed from open coding and concept maps in ATLAS.ti informed the following theory development. First, learning with interactive videoconferencing in kindergarten supports meaning making from four Vygotskian tenets: (1) the social origins of learning, (2) sign and tool use through mediated activity, (3) the importance of language, and (4) support for the zone of proximal development. Additionally, the students' meaning making involved the tenets' entwinement rather than the solitary occurrence of individual tenets. Regarding the kindergartners' emerging inquiries, during sustained interactive videoconferencing levels, children's inquiries and dialogue evidenced exploratory talk that was purposeful, reflective and self-directed. It also indicated comfort with the technology. This study is unique in its multidisciplinary application of Vygotskian learning theory to kindergartners' meaning making with videoconferencing and provides a foundation for extended use of qualitative methods to examine young children's' learning with technology.

T1  - Interorganizational relationships among providers of public social services for emotionally disturbed children in rural East Texas
AN  - 194000869
AB  - The primary providers of services to Texas children with emotional/behavioral issues are local juvenile probation departments, Texas Youth Commission, Department of Family and Protective Services, local Mental Health Authorities, and school districts.  These agencies currently face a variety of issues that impede their ability to deliver effective services.  Responses to these issues have included narrowing eligibility criteria and imposing limits on the number of clients served at one time.  Unfortunately, many of the individuals who need assistance are unable to access services and eventually find themselves in other less appropriate systems, such as foster care and juvenile justice.  This is especially true for rural areas, which often lack the resources found in urban counties.  Many believe the solution involves closing the "gaps" in services through interorganizational relationships.   However, cooperative efforts require a substantial amount of commitment, time, effort and resources.  More often than not, this is a difficult endeavor, especially given the barriers to rural service delivery, funding issues, and state level issues.    Concept Mapping was employed to identify and assess the impact of factors that affect service providers' ability to engage in interorganizational relationships, as well as deliver services to children who are at risk of or possess emotional/behavioral issues. Concept Mapping is a mixed methods approach capable of identifying the specific domains of a larger conceptual framework.  The results can enhance our understanding of the concept and inform planning and evaluation activities.  Forty-eight individuals from rural East Texas participated in various stages of the study, resulting in the identification of 118 factors that were subsequently sorted into six conceptual domains and rated in terms of importance and response (encouraging or discouraging). Participants also provided narrative responses regarding service delivery situations, components to change and keep the same, and perceptions of the system's capacity for change.  Key findings include the identification of specific factors that affect interorganizational relationships and service delivery, as well as potential changes to the current social services system.  Also, consistency among respondents suggests the climate is conducive to cooperation.  The results are discussed in the context of implications for interorganizational relationships and service delivery.

T1  - Concept maps as assessment tools in mathematics: Comparison with clinical interviews
AN  - 193733707
AB  - The thesis investigated the validity of concept maps assessments of mathematical knowledge by examining the ability of concept maps to predict the understanding of mathematical knowledge revealed on clinical interviews. The subjects of this thesis came from a traditional remedial algebra course. Data collected included transcriptions of videotaped interviews and concept maps drawn by students which were designed to investigate students' understanding of mathematics concepts of function and slope. The knowledge involved in the transcripts and interviews were categorized by the researcher and an expert separately. Then the themes that emerged in the transcripts are compared with those emerged in student maps. Qualitative analysis provided the evidence that the concept maps may tap into many aspects of mathematical knowledge that heretofore have been accessible only by way of the clinical interviews. Results suggest that network structured concept maps offer a more appropriate technique for documenting and assess mathematical knowledge than chain structure. They may allow teachers to identify and discriminate well among disparate levels of mathematical understanding.

T1  - Image classification using particle swarm optimisation
AN  - 1795018514
AB  - The main objective of the research presented in this thesis is to study and develop an integrated visual classification framework based on Self Organising Maps. The framework exploits the recent developments of Particle Swarm Optimisation fro enhancing the performance of machine learning algorithm. The proposed framework is applied to extract the visual semantics of the multimedia content and model human subjectivity by developing a relevance feedback module.  In this thesis the elementary principle of chaos is introduced to model the behaviour of Particle Swarm Optimisation and the algorithm is evaluated for visual classification problem. Also, a comparative study of Particle Swarm Optimisation with other Evolutionary Computation paradigms namely Evolutionary Programming, Evolution Strategies and Genetic Algorithm is presented on standard fitness functions.  Following the developments of online photo management systems, there is an increasing interest in associating visual media with free-text annotations. The additional textural information is identified as a rich source of complementary information for extracting high-level semantics. A novel approach called Semantic Concept Mapping is used to classify entities occurring in the text to a custom-defined set of concepts is proposed. The novelty of the proposed algorithm is attributed to exploiting the relations between common entities available in the WordNet thesaurus.  To address the problem of semantic retrieval of multimedia content, an ontology driven video processing system is introduced. The system extends the proposed classifier framework to analyse video data. In order to ensure interoperability between semantic web and other video processing systems, the metadata extracted from the video is described with a formal description of Multimedia Ontology developed based on MPEG â�� 7 standard. Thus providing a platform for semantic retrieval based on the userâ��s query.

T1  - Learning Partnerships - The Art of Handling Ambiguity
AN  - 1415221007
AB  - This intrinsic case study is about people who worked in partnerships. Each of the partnerships emerged from relationships formed between the business, education, government and community sectors. A principle aim of the cross-sector partnerships was to enhance learning opportunities, integral to which was the incorporation of ICT. The study explores through interweaving narratives, some of the key interrelationships that emerged from the evolving partnerships as they strived to accomplish their aims.The partnerships represented a rich and complex context for dynamic and strategic change occurring, not only in the evolving partnerships, but also in the systems they intended to consolidate and optimise. Furthermore, such complexity pervaded ideological notions of instability and discontinuity arising from difference that may be implicit or explicit in open, distributed complex systems.The metaphor of hypertext serves to both retain textural qualities of organisation and address key problematics associated with visualisation and representation and also as a means to reflect upon the study by encouraging improvisatory processes akin to those experienced by the participants. In this respect, hypertext is not used to simply challenge artificial boundaries, linearities and determinisms but rather, prompt the construction of meanings further to those partially represented. It also serves to maintain a clearer relationship between those contexts within which research has been, or becomes situated.The thesis largely rests on its representational form in terms of its self-sufficiency to portray, convey, express, evoke, engage and inform. Ambiguity forms a fundamental facet of the thesis. In addition to those that rest within the texts, graphic illustrations are used to provide narratives in different forms whereby, readers are not bound by the same inadequacies or constraints in drawing meaning about the subject from text alone. By taking the view of the artist, the illustrations provide a flexibility that overcomes some of the dimensional limitations of the thesis and further emphasises its connectionist, constructivist and aesthetic undertones. The links between components and nuanced meanings emphasises the interdependencies in terms that transcend the representational form of discursive language. The case is thus, synthesised in the following illustration:

T1  - Evaluating conceptual change in high school honors chemistry students studying quantum concepts
AN  - 304898906
AB  - High school honors chemistry students have difficulty applying abstract nanooscopic concepts to predict chemical properties. This dissertation aims at evaluating misconceptions and conceptual change in quantum concepts among honors chemistry students from a suburban high school near Boston. For that purpose a new graphical organizer known as a linkage matrix was developed. The researcher investigated the relative extent to which students shifted to a paradigm of using quantum concepts when explaining macroscopic properties such as solubility or color.   The researcher compared the qualitative effects of traditional methods of instruction, i.e. lecture/lab in three classes of seventeen students with the additional effects of discovery via computer simulation on student understanding from two of those classes. Students produced concept maps both prior and subsequent to their study of quantum chemistry. The researcher applied the student-cohort's propositional phrases in a linkage matrix based on eight concepts to analyze student understanding of quantum concepts. Four students from each of the experimental classes were interviewed regarding their c-maps linking phrases to identify patterns and assess the scoring validity.   The linkage matrix was used to determine the twelve linking phrases exhibiting a thirty percent improvement in student understanding. All students exhibited a decrease in the number of misconceptions. However, the experimental group showed a greater capacity to link more concepts at a deeper level after the intervention.   Previously documented misconception such as overgeneralization, and the particulate nature of matter are exacerbated by the difficulty students have with energy and, sign. The research suggests that the activities designed should allow students practice manipulating the variables. The correlational reasoning ability of the students was evaluated using the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking as a potential cause of students' difficulty attributing the relationships among concepts.

T1  - From consumer to prosumer: Changing perceptions in the use and production of digital video
AN  - 304898852
AB  - This qualitative case study looks at the experiences of five content experts and one project manager who came together to develop an interactive training web site for the Calgary Health Region's Infection Control Unit. The research analyzed the process used to develop instructional videos for the web site. Data collected from an online survey, interviews and artefact reviews (i.e., beta-tester surveys, storyboards, concept maps, video scripts and digital videos) were analyzed using themes and codes. The five themes, derived from the literature review of educational video and Instructional Design, used in this research include: Instructional Strategy, Content, Message Design, Andragogy and Engaged Learning. The findings from the research suggest that technology has the potential to enable content experts to move into the realm of media producers, and by participating directly in the process of design and development, content or subject matter experts have a better understanding of the role of the producer, and how, why and when to use video for instructional purposes.

T1  - Continuing medical education for physicians: Key factors contributing to learning and change
AN  - 304863110
AB  - Using an adaptation of Kolb's (1984) Experiential Learning Theory (ELT), this study explored key factors that contributed to the learning and change process of physicians. The author worked with seven pediatrician physician instructors to help them improve the instructional strategies they employed in a lecture series for third-year medical students. These physician instructors engaged in a process that allowed them to (a) develop experience to support the solving of a genuine problem, (b) engage in deliberate practice, (c) reflect on their experience and practice using analogical reasoning, and (d) ultimately refine their mental model of effective instruction. Using qualitative research methods, the author reviewed interview transcripts and artifacts such as concept maps and session handouts used by the physician instructors. Findings indicate that change in the physician instructors' mental models was the keystone of changes to performance. Changes in mental models were supported by a combination of solving genuine problems, deliberate practice, and reflection via analogical reasoning. Changes in mental models were also facilitated by environmental factors in the form of support from the researcher in helping physicians make changes their instructional strategies. Implications for continuing medical education and suggestions for future research are also presented.

T1  - The impact of concept map visualizations on the information behavior, perceptions of performance, learning and use with novices in the information retrieval context
AN  - 304861898
AB  - In examining undergraduate students in the information retrieval environment for the impact of computer generated concept maps, two primary research questions were considered: (1) what is the impact of display type on the novice searcher's information behavior; and (2) what is the impact of different display types on the user's perceptions of performance, knowledge and overall use of the system.    Sixty participants in this experiment were given hypothetical information needs on two different medical topics (cholesterol, depression). Participants' explored one of three interactive visualization displays using these medical topics, answered a pre- and post-test instrument and then completed a final questionnaire on their perceptions of the displays. Different types of inferential statistical tests were used to examine the research questions. When appropriate, factorial ANOVAs, mixed between-within ANOVAs, and chi square tests of independence were conducted.    Five main findings resulted from this research: (1) for all display types (LIST, SOM, PFNET) there is an increase in the number of participant search terms and in the incorporation of MeSH terminology from the visualizations following exposure to those displays; (2) there is a relationship between the display type and the interface level from which PFNET participants chose terms; (3) searchers' feelings of confidence, satisfaction, success, and relevance increased across all groups after system interaction; however, pre-test feelings of confidence and satisfaction seem to be dependent upon the participant's self-reported prior knowledge of the search topic; (4) feelings of confidence and satisfaction on the topic participants reported less pre-test knowledge on (cholesterol) shifted to match post-test ratings of confidence and satisfaction on the topic they had more pre-test knowledge on (depression); and (5) participants rated the PFNET system more visually appealing, easier to understand and more likely to be used in the future if given the option. Overall findings suggest that all displays were useful to the participants in this experiment and that the PFNET display was particularly useful for the novice searcher.

T1  - The urban environment and physical activity: Factors impacting adolescents' use of recreational facilities
AN  - 304857814
AB  - Aims. The aims of this research are (1) to qualitatively investigate environmental factors influencing both physical activity and recreational facility use for physical activity and (2) to identify and test the statistical significance of associations between park use and objective and perceived measures of the environment.    Methods. Data were collected from students at two predominately African American magnet high schools in Baltimore, Maryland. Multiple qualitative methods were used to address the first aim. First, concept mapping was conducted with 50 adolescents to elicit and rate the importance of environmental factors influencing physical activity. Next, 48 in-depth interviews and 26 direct observations were conducted to explore factors influencing the use of parks and recreation centers for physical activity. To address the second aim, survey data collected from 329 adolescents and Geographical Information Systems data assessing neighborhood park availability and crime were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between park use and objective and perceived environmental characteristics.    Results. Adolescents identified seven domains that they perceive of as influencing their physical activity. The relative importance of these domains varied by gender. Young women rated negative social influences, such as crime and violence, as most important to physical activity while young men rated social support and physical activity settings as most important. Adolescents reported several factors that impact facility use, including the presence of adolescent-oriented facilities, maintenance, proximity to home, and cost. The social environment is a key factor, as adolescents prefer safe facilities where they find other active adolescents. The quantitative analysis revealed that objective environmental measures, including park availability and neighborhood crime, were not associated with park use. Several self-reported measures, including increased park availability, park quality, and park use by peers and family, were positively associated with park use. Perceived neighborhood crime, however, was not associated with park use.    Conclusions. This research underscores the relevance of program and policy efforts that aim to promote physical activity through modifications to the environment. Moreover, it highlights the need to develop multi-level intervention approaches that address characteristics of the social and physical environments as well as adolescents' perceptions of the environment.

T1  - The use of interactive instructional strategies on academic performance in nurse education programs
AN  - 304848314
AB  - It is widely recognized that there is a severe shortage of qualified health-care workers in the United States (Kinard, 2004). In the nursing profession specifically, registered nurses are in high demand but short supply. As a result, collegiate programs have found themselves recruiting new students from a much broader base population than before (Campbell & Davis, 1990). Nursing programs therefore risk accepting individuals who may have difficulty meeting the academic demands of required courses in the nursing major.   Although addressing students' academic weaknesses is a challenge, it is important for nurse educators to find strategies that will enable students to be successful and to remain in their nursing programs (Beckes, 1980; Group, 1984; Hodges, 1988; Reed & Hudepohl 1983). In this study the researcher argues that a major factor to be considered in achieving this goal is the use by nurse education faculty of interactive instructional strategies. These strategies may be defined as those in which the instructor engages in dialogue with students or students themselves interact with each other.   This study was designed to answer the following research questions: (1) Do nurse educators in high, medium and low NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) performing schools report differences in the interaction they promote in their use of four instructional strategies? (2) Are there differences in the incidence of use of each of the four instructional strategies employed by nurse educators in high, medium and low NCLEX performing schools? (3) What do nurse educators report to be their purpose for using each of the four instructional strategies?   Piaget (1950) and Vygotsky (1978) have provided contemporary educators with a theoretical foundation for the development of teaching methodologies that foster active learning and the meaningful construction of concepts. Vygotsky's work, in particular, has indicated the importance of student to teacher and student to student interaction as new concepts are learned. Consequently methodologies that focus on interaction are an important part of a teacher's repertoire.    Interactive instructional strategies in college math, engineering and psychology have been positively correlated with academic achievement (Duncan& Dick, 2000; Ventimiglia, 1994; Woods, 1996). However, there is little research into the use of interactive instructional strategies in nursing education.    This research study used an ex post facto design. A researcher-designed survey was sent to a sample of nurse educators from purposefully selected state universities and colleges throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States with baccalaureate nursing programs. These institutions were grouped by the researcher into high (89-97 percent), medium (81-88 percent) and low (70-80 percent) NCLEX scoring schools. The survey collected responses that most closely reflect the participants' agreement or disagreement with statements regarding the use of four instructional strategies: lecture, case study, concept mapping and instructional games.   Nurse faculty in high, medium and low NCLEX performing schools did not report differences in the interaction they promote in their teaching. Low NCLEX performing schools did show a statistically significant higher mean in interactivity with regards to concept mapping than high NCLEX performing schools. There were no significant differences in the incidence of use of each interactive methodology employed by nurse educators in high, medium and low NCLEX performing schools. There were also no differences in reported purposes for using different interactive methodologies.

T1  - The effects of a professional development geoscience education institute upon secondary school science teachers in Puerto Rico
AN  - 304840730
AB  - The geographic and geologic settings of Puerto Rico served as the context to develop a mixed methods investigation on: (1) the effects of a five-day long constructivist and field-based earth science education professional development institute upon 26 secondary school science teachers' earth science conceptual knowledge, perceptions of fieldwork, and beliefs about teaching earth science; and (2) the implementation of participants' newly acquired knowledge and experience in their science lessons at school.  Qualitative data included questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, reflective journals, pre-post concept maps, and pre-post lesson plans.  The Geoscience Concept Inventory and the Science Outdoor Learning Environment Inventory were translated into Spanish and culturally validated to collect quantitative data.  Data was analyzed through a constructivist grounded theory methodology, descriptive statistics, and non-parametric methods.  Participants came to the institute with serious deficiencies in earth science conceptual understanding, negative earth science teaching perspectives, and inadequate earth science teaching methodologies.  The institute helped participants to improve their understanding of earth science concepts, content, and processes mostly related to the study of rocks, the Earth's structure, plate tectonics, maps, and the geology of Puerto Rico.  Participants also improved their earth science teaching beliefs, perceptions on field-based education, and reflected on their environmental awareness and social responsibility. Participants greatly benefited from the field-based learning environment, inquiry-based teaching approaches modeled, the attention given to their affective domain, and reflections on their teaching practice as part of the institute's activities. The constructivist learning environment and the institute's contextualized and meaningful learning conceptual model were effective in generating interest and confidence in earth science teaching.  Some participants successfully integrated inquiry-based lessons on the nature of science and earth science at their schools, but were unsuccessful in integrating field trips.  The lack of teacher education programs and the inadequacy of earth science conceptual and pedagogical understanding held by in-service teachers are the main barriers for effective earth science teaching in Puerto Rico. This study established a foundation for future earth science education projects for Latino teachers.  Additionally, as a result of this investigation various recommendations were made to effectively implement earth science teacher education programs in Puerto Rico and internationally.

T1  - Improving high school physical science students' understanding of the electromagnetic spectrum: A modified diagram approach
AN  - 304836632
AB  - The focus of this study was to identify major conceptual difficulties that selected public high school physical science students encounter in understanding a standard electromagnetic spectrum diagram. A research-driven, modified version of that standard diagram was used in this study to determine the value added to student understanding of electromagnetic waves. A content analysis was performed on electromagnetic spectrum diagrams found in US textbooks from the 1950s through the present. A class of public high school physical science students participated in a study consisting of four activities conducted during a three-week unit. Students were given a pre- and post-achievement test and a pre- and post-survey on the regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the conclusion of each activity, selected students were interviewed and each co-constructed a concept map with the researcher. The Electromagnetic Spectrum Literacy Rubric (ESLR) was designed and used to assess students’ conceptual understanding periodically as they proceeded through the unit study. A mixed methods analysis was performed, employing both qualitative and quantitative data. A paired t-test determined that there was a statistically significant difference (p = 0.014) between the pre- and post-achievement test scores for the class of students participating in the unit study. Effect sizes also determined that students have difficulties with mathematical calculations and wave properties. These topics present conceptual challenges which must be overcome to understand and use an electromagnetic spectrum diagram effectively.

T1  - Mental models of *text
AN  - 304835391
AB  - Two experiments investigated whether prompting students to monitor what they were reading would result in better text comprehension than other methods of text presentation. In Experiments 1 and 2, 144 students studied text on the heart and circulatory system under different conditions. Their mental models were assessed before and after studying the text by testing the participant's ability to produce diagrams and concept maps, as well as answer knowledge and inference questions in the domain.    In Experiment 1, students studied the text in one of three conditions. Participants studied the text alone, or they were prompted to answer adjunct inference questions, or they were prompted to monitor for new information while studying the text. Participants who were prompted for monitoring showed significant improvements in updating their mental models over participants in the other two conditions. Although providing adjunct questions was more effective than providing the text alone, adjunct questions were not as effective as monitoring in resulting in participants' improvement of mental models. Although Experiment 1 indicated a significant advantage for monitoring, it was not clear whether this advantage was selective for some aspects of the mental model or for all aspects of the mental model.    Experiment 2 examined monitoring further by presenting the text and prompting for global monitoring, specific monitoring, or adjunct knowledge questions. The adjunct knowledge questions were used to determine whether the advantage for monitoring was simply a rehearsal advantage. The results of Experiment 2 showed clearly that either of the monitoring conditions (specific or global) led to significant improvement in aspects of the mental models and updating of central concepts. However, only participants in the global monitoring condition showed a significant advantage over the other two conditions in answering knowledge and inference questions. This indicated that prompting for global monitoring leads to more complete revising and updating of mental models than text only, adjunct inference questions, adjunct knowledge questions, or specific monitoring.

T1  - Using expert knowledge structures to design decision aids
AN  - 304825410
AB  - Auditors use decision aids and audit support systems throughout the course of their work.  Previous research concerning decision aids indicates that the use of such aids can result in the deskilling of the user.  However, other research indicates that a properly designed decision aid can pass along knowledge to the user.  This study demonstrates that a decision aid that is designed using an expert's knowledge structure will result in expertise development by the aid users.  The experimental task involved financial fraud risk assessments made with the assistance of a checklist aid and used student participants.  Two independent variables were employed in this study, decision aid design and outcome feedback.  The manipulation of the decision aid design determined whether the decision aid was organized according to the fraud triangle or according to experts' knowledge structures.  The manipulation of feedback involved the presence or absence of outcome feedback.  Planned comparisons were utilized to test the hypothesis.  According to expectations, a decision aid designed using expert knowledge structures assisted users in developing expert-like knowledge structures and improved performance.  The results suggest that expert knowledge structures could be used in the design of checklist aids in the future.    I found that the organization of the decision aid was a statistically significant determinant of both the knowledge acquisition of the participant and the performance of the participant.  Further, I found that the interaction of decision aid organization and outcome feedback has a statistically significant effect on the performance of the participant.  Supporting my hypotheses, those participants who were in the expertly organized decision aid treatment that were given outcome feedback had knowledge structures that were the closest to the experts and performance that was the closest to the experts.

T1  - An examination of the effect of teacher read -aloud on adolescent attitudes and learning in science
AN  - 304824845
AB  - Having been established as an important component of early literacy development, the use of teacher read-aloud as an instructional strategy has the potential to benefit adolescent students. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect teacher read-aloud had on adolescent learning in science and how the results varied according to individual reading ability.    The study was a counterbalanced design gathering both quantitative and qualitative data for analysis from two treatment procedures. Seventh and eighth grade students were given the reading portion of the SAT-9 to provide a national percentile ranking in reading. All students then participated in two consecutive units of study: one unit requiring students to read the science text silently and the second unit providing a teacher read-aloud of all text. The classroom procedures, assignments, and related activities were exactly the same for both treatments. Student learning was measured with pretest, posttest, and delayed posttest concept map scores on each unit of study.    A survey administered at the end of the study examined student attitudes toward the teacher read-aloud and served as the source for in-depth interviews concerning preference for or dislike of the teacher read-aloud strategy. An interview with the science teacher provided another outlook on the oral reading treatment.    A repeated measures analysis suggested both teacher read-aloud and silent reading were appropriate for student learning but results do not support either method as superior over the other. Multiple regression analyses were conducted on the posttest and delayed posttest scores as the dependent measured, had a significant relationship between treatment by reading ability interaction on one analysis. Regression equations constructed for each level of the treatment indicated that as reading ability increases, students received more benefits from the teacher read-aloud procedure.    A correlation compared reading ability with attitude toward teacher read-aloud. Seventy-eight of the participants had a positive attitude toward the intervention, with no students reading below the 50th percentile showing disapproval. Interview responses supported these results since all below average readers favor the oral presentation. Overall themes from the interviews offered advantages and disadvantages of teacher read-aloud, suggestions for implementation, and a teacher's perspective on practical applications in science classes.

T1  - Concept mapping and describing the sources of impact on Black gay college student identity development at 4-year institutions
AN  - 304824679
AB  - This study examined two primary research objectives: (a) to identify the factors that traditional-age (18- to 22-year-old) Black gay college men at 4-year institutions perceived to have affected their identities, and (b) to determine how Black gay college men conceptually organized those factors of impact. Phase One of this study collected 101 experiences through the College Years Experience Questionnaire (CYEQ) from traditional-age Black gay college men. The CYEQ used the critical incident technique to collect written student descriptions about particular experiences that had influenced their sense of identity. Participants were also asked to rate their experiences on a 7-point scale to discover whether the experience was positive and uncovered the eventual effect on their sense of self. A team of three doctoral raters identified 13 categories from the 101 experiences.    In Phase Two of the study the 13 categories were used for the Paired Comparison Questionnaire in which 15 students rated the similarity of each possible pair of the 13 categories, using a scale of 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Using multidimensional scaling, the Phase Two responses were further analyzed and illustrated on a two-dimensional concept map that graphed the experiences for Black gay college men. The dimensions used to plot the coordinates of the 13 categories were named (a) External Challenges of Gay Identity versus Internal Challenges of Gay Identity, and (b) Gay Identity Clarifications versus Gay Identity Confusion. The hierarchical cluster analysis was used to develop five clusters to describe the categories contained in each cluster.    The 13 categories from Phase One correlated with previous research that addressed identity development for Black gay men and validated the results. The clusters explained the support or lack of support that Black gay men receive from their institutions. The study reviewed limitations and presented recommendations for future research, and discussed implications for higher education practitioners.

T1  - From their perspective: Discovering the sources of impact on older women undergraduates' identity development and mapping those experiences
AN  - 304823938
AB  - This two-phase, mixed methods study examined (a) the sources of impact that women undergraduate students, 35 years old and older, perceived to have affected their personal identity development and (b) how they conceptually organized those experiences. Through a purposeful sampling strategy, 62 undergraduate women (whose ages ranged from 35 to 58) participated in the first phase of the study by completing the College Years Experience Questionnaire (CYEQ). Using a variant of Flanagan's (1954) Critical Incident Technique, the CYEQ asked participants to reflect on their experience as a college student and report experiences that had affected their sense of who they are. A team of three doctoral students identified 12 categories of impact in the incidents. These categories were used in the Phase Two paired comparison questionnaire, in which students were asked to rate the similarity of each possible pair of the 12 categories. Eighteen Phase One undergraduate women participated in Phase Two and rated the similarity of the categories.    Using multidimensional scaling, a two dimensional concept map was created from Phase Two data to illustrate how the women organized the experiences. The dimension weights were used to plot the coordinates of the 12 themes and the dimensions were named (Constructive versus Destructive Experiences; External Affirmation versus Personal Perseverance). Hierarchical cluster analysis was used to define a three cluster solution that illustrated how the themes were qualitatively different. The raters named the three clusters to describe the types of themes contained in each cluster.    The 12 themes that emerged during the analysis of Phase One data were associated with key factors that theory and prior research identified as influencing personal identity development and demonstrated the profound effect of college on the study participants' personal identity development. The clusters and dimensions illustrated the importance of relationships, especially student-faculty relationships, to the women. That the clusters and dimensions were consistent with prior theory and research provides validation for the results. Limitations of the study, suggestions for future research, and implications for higher education practitioners were also discussed.

T1  - A study to determine the essential nurse anesthesia program competencies to be included in clinical performance evaluation tools
AN  - 304820891
AB  - The role of performance evaluations in the educational process of practice disciplines such as social work, psychology, medicine, and nursing in general has been well documented. However, a review of the nurse anesthesia education literature demonstrated a lack of research to develop valid and reliable performance evaluation tools. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to identify the core educational objectives nurse anesthesia program administrators have for their students, reasoning that these should be the basis for a generally accepted clinical performance evaluation tool.   In this study, nurse anesthesia educational program administrators were provided a list of potential clinical objectives and were asked to identify those criteria they believed were essential to evaluate in student performance on a daily basis. Administrators were randomly selected to consider the criteria as it would pertain to either a first or last semester/quarter student. Nearly all of the items were found to be essential with some pertaining more to first semester/quarter students while others pertained more to last semester/quarter students. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and hierarchical cluster analyses were then utilized in order to develop a graphical representation (i.e., a concept map) of the manner in which participants organized the trainee skills.    Concept mapping provided a visual representation of the evaluation items and demonstrated how the items coordinate with Bloom's educational domains. Similarities were noted in the overall construction and dimensionality of the two concept mappings. Dimension 1 for the graphs appeared to capture the cognitive domain while Dimension 2 appeared to capture a psychomotor versus an affective domain. Although some statistical differences were noted between the two groups of responses and the clustered items were different, it appears that the overall perceptions of the essential items were similar because dimensional interpretation was the same.   The use of consistent, standardized feedback is an essential component of any ongoing evaluation process. The results of this study may be used as a starting place for the development of a standardized clinical performance evaluation form using those behaviors identified as being essential to the evaluation process.

T1  - Genetics instruction with history of science: Nature of science learning
AN  - 304817350
AB  - This study explored the effect of history of genetics in teaching genetics and learning the nature of science (NOS). A quasi-experimental control group research design with pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests was used, combining qualitative data and quantitative data. Two classes which consisted of tenth grade biology students participated in this study. The present study involved two instructional interventions, Best Practice Instruction with History of Genetics (BPIw/HG) and Best Practice Instruction (BPI). The experimental group received BPIw/HG utilizing various historical materials from the history of genetics, while the control group was not introduced to historical materials.    Scientific Attitude Inventory II, Genetics Terms' Definitions with Concept Mapping (GTDCM), NOS Terms' Definitions with Concept Mapping (NTDCM), and View of Nature of Science (VNOS-C) were used to investigate students' scientific attitude inventory, and their understanding of genetics as well as the NOS.    The results showed that students' scientific attitude inventory, and their understanding of genetics and the NOS were not statistically significantly different in the pretest (p>.05). After the intervention, the experimental group of students who received BPIw/HG demonstrated better understanding of the NOS. NTDCM results showed that the experimental group was better in defining the NOS terms and constructing a concept map ( p<.01). In addition, the experimental group retained their understanding of the NOS two-months after the completion of the intervention, showing no statistically significant difference between the posttest and the delayed posttest of NTDCM (p>.05). Further, VNOS-C data indicated that a greater percentage of the experimental group than the control group improved their understanding of the NOS. However, the two groups' understanding of genetics concepts did not show any statistically significant difference in the pretest, the posttest, and the delayed posttest (p>.05). This result implicated that allocating classroom time in introducing history of science neither helped nor hindered learning science content.

T1  - The sources of impact in college on gay male student identity: The current student perspective
AN  - 304807334
AB  - The visibility of the gay student population on university campuses has increased substantially over the past 2 decades. Despite this, the sources of impact on their identity development during college have remained largely a mystery. Fifty-nine self-identified gay male undergraduate and graduate students, ages 18-30, at public and private universities nationwide participated in a mixed-methods, two-phase study. In the first phase students utilized a critical incident format to describe experiences that they believed to have had the greatest impact on their identity development during their undergraduate years in college. In the second phase study the participants assigned similarity ratings to the 14 identified categories of impact. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were then used to analyze these data. This analysis resulted in the creation of a concept map that represented in pictorial form the ways in which these gay students had organized these categories of experiences. Implications of the research for higher education practitioners and suggestions for future research are presented.

T1  - Concept mapping: Methods to improve critical thinking
AN  - 304804069
AB  - In an effort to prepare nursing students to deliver safe quality care, critical thinking becomes essential to nursing education. Nurse educators are continually looking for methods that will enhance or improve critical thinking skills. One method that educators have used is concept mapping. Concept mapping allows students to organize their thoughts and see relationships between concepts and plan nursing care accordingly.   The intent of this study was to examine the relationship between concept mapping and critical thinking in first year nursing students. The study employed a quantitative and qualitative design. The quantitative was a pre and post test quasi-experimental design with a non-randomized control group and intervention group. The qualitative design utilized a phenomenological approach to examine the participants lived experience. A pre and post test was custom designed by HESI based on the participants' current curriculum. Demographic data (n=11) was collected on GPA, number of credit hours, age and gender.   The pretest mean scores were not significant between the two groups (p=.825). ANCOVA revealed that there was no variable (GPA, age, gender or number of credit hours) that had significant impact on pretest scores (p=.884). A paired t-test revealed that both groups had a significant increase in post test scores (control group p=.028, experiment group p=.006). An independent t-test revealed that the experimental group mean change score was significantly higher than the control group (p=.018). ANCOVA was then utilized to examine if the mean change scores were significant while adjusting for the other covariates and taking into consideration the small sample size (n=11). The results revealed that the concept mapping group had a significantly greater improvement on their post test scores when compared to the control group scores while controlling for other covariates (p=.022).   The qualitative analysis revealed that concept mapping provided the participants with direction on how to prepare for clinical assignments. As the participants developed their concept maps it became their model for thinking. As the participants created their model they developed a sense of ownership and empowerment of the knowledge. The participants further described that concept mapping required a higher level of thinking. Participants described that concept mapping helped them to critically think as it required them to research and investigate relationships.

T1  - Using concept maps as a tool for cross-language relevance determination
AN  - 304792723
AB  - Concept maps, introduced by Novak, aid learners’ understanding. I hypothesize that concept maps also can function as a summary of large documents, e.g., electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs). I have built a system that automatically generates concept maps from English-language ETDs in the computing field. The system also will provide Spanish translations of these concept maps for native Spanish speakers. Using machine translation techniques, my approach leads to concept maps that could allow researchers to discover pertinent dissertations in languages they cannot read, helping them to decide if they want a potentially relevant dissertation translated.   I am using a state-of-the-art natural language processing system, called Relex, to extract noun phrases and noun-verb-noun relations from ETDs, and then produce concept maps automatically. I also have incorporated information from the table of contents of ETDs to create novel styles of concept maps. I have conducted five user studies, to evaluate user perceptions about these different map styles.   I am using several methods to translate node and link text in concept maps from English to Spanish. Nodes labeled with single words from a given technical area can be translated using wordlists, but phrases in specific technical fields can be difficult to translate. Thus I have amassed a collection of about 580 Spanish-language ETDs from Scirus and two Mexican universities and I am using this corpus to mine phrase translations that I could not find otherwise.   The usefulness of the automatically-generated and translated concept maps has been assessed in an experiment at Universidad de las Americas (UDLA) in Puebla, Mexico. This experiment demonstrated that concept maps can augment abstracts (translated using a standard machine translation package) in helping Spanish speaking users find ETDs of interest.*   *This research work was funded in part by NSF through grants DUE-0121679 and IIS-0080748, a grant from IMLS, and the RDEC/ACE project.

T1  - Women's experiences of infertility
AN  - 304787164
AB  - The goal of the study was to gain a conceptual understanding of the challenges faced by infertile women, as well as they ways in which they deal with their experience. Concept mapping, a methodological approach combining qualitative and quantitative strategies was used to understand the experience of 26 women who were infertile. Five thematic clusters were identified regarding the challenges of infertility: Uncertainty, Medical Stressors, Psychological Impact, Social Reminders of Infertility, and Marital and Interpersonal Strains. The ways in which women deal with infertility were grouped into four thematic clusters: Seeking Information, Coping Strategies, Receiving Support, and Emotional Expression. These results indicate how women prioritized the challenges and methods of dealing with infertility. The uncertainty associated with the infertility experience was perceived as a key challenge, while the importance of seeking information was highlighted as a crucial method for dealing with infertility.

T1  - A concept mapping study of the impact of mobilization and deployment on United States Army reservists
AN  - 304777839
AB  - This exploratory study utilized an innovative methodology, concept mapping, to examine the impact of mobilization and deployment on Army Reservists during  Operation Iraqi Freedom. Free-response methodology identified 103 items generated by soldiers who had been deployed from the 98th Division. Five individual interviews with post-deployed soldiers were also conducted to validate the content of the free-responses. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to identify the underlying structure of the impact of mobilization and deployment. Six specific deployment impact clusters were identified: (1) Family, (2)  Life Altering Experience/Readjustment, (3) My Personal Connection to the War in Iraq, (4) Pride and Patriotism , (5) Coping and Self-Awareness, and (6)  Disillusionment. The clusters My Personal Connection to the War in Iraq and Pride and Patriotism were rated as having the most impact for the mobilized and deployed soldiers. Pattern matching analysis was also conducted to examine the degree of impact of the deployment impact items relationship to Reservist characteristics including gender, age, length of deployment, marital status and rank. With the exception of marital status, there were only minor differences among the intensity of the ratings. Soldier's quality of life was also assessed through use Veteran's Rand 36-Item Health Survey. The VR-36 Mental Component Summary score for enlisted soldiers was found to be significantly lower than the MCS mean for the officers. This exploratory study is intended to be an introductory model for studying and understanding the structure of the impact of deployment among US Army Reservists.

T1  - Concept mapping: Impact on content and organization of technical writing in science
AN  - 304769663
AB  - The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to compare the relationship between concept mapping and the content and organization of technical writing of ninth grade biology students. All students in the study completed a prewriting assessment. The experimental group received concept map instruction while the control group performed alternate tasks. After instruction, both groups completed the postwriting assessment and mean differences were compared using the t statistic for independent measures. Additionally, scores on the concept map were correlated to the scores on the postwriting assessment using the Pearson correlation coefficient. Finally, attitudes toward using concept mapping as a prewriting strategy were analyzed using the  t statistic for repeated measures. Concept mapping significantly improved the depth of content; however, no statistical significance was detected for organization. Students had a significantly positive change in attitude toward using concept mapping to plan a writing assessment, organize information, and think creatively. The findings indicated concept mapping had a positive effect on the students' abilities to select concepts appropriate to respond to a writing prompt, integrate facts into complete thoughts and ideas, and apply it in novel situations. Concept maps appeared to facilitate learning how to process information and transform it into expository writing. Sustained practice in designing concept maps may influence organization as well as content. Developing a systematic approach to synthesize well-organized and coherent arguments in response to a writing task is an invaluable communication skill that has implications for the learner across disciplines and prepares them for higher education and the workforce.

T1  - An exploration into mystical experiences in the context of health care
AN  - 304769297
AB  - In this qualitative phenomenological study, the researcher interviewed 18 hospitalised patients and community members in rural Appalachia to learn about their mystical experiences in the context of health care. A loosely structured interview format addressed factors that initiate mystical experience and essential qualities of mystical experience. In addition, the researcher examined the nursing process, focusing on assessments and actions which supported the participants in sharing their experiences. The researcher also considered her response to being the recipient of these shared experiences. Data were analysed using the crystallisation/immersion method and concept mapping. Mystical experience was conceptualised as a process incorporating  initiation, occurrence, maturation, and integration of mystical experience. Essential aspects of the mystical experience itself were found to include sensory-motor perception, interaction with the supernatural, interaction with dead and living members of the family, conviction of reality, cognition, dynamic tension and emotional intensity.  Nursing actions which supported the participant included  listening and support. The researcher's response to the participants' sharing their experiences included tension, intimacy and empathy, sense of awe and autonomic responses. In addition, the researcher developed an appreciation of the mystical in everyday experience.    Key words. Autonomic response, caring, ecstasy, entheogen, mysticism, mystical experience, religion, spirituality.

T1  - Instructional design model for promoting meaningful learning and problem solving skills for accounting information system students
AN  - 304767906
AB  - Learning complex concepts with technology is both a challenge and an opportunity for designers of distant learning programs. The accounting practitioner faces increased pressure to obtain skills related to information systems and problem solving. This increase is the result of amplified risk assessment responsibility created by the recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and the information technology revolution. Instructional design in the accounting field must change in response to these new advanced skills required by practitioners. This quasi-experimental study addressed the need for innovation in accounting instruction by exploring the value of an online instructional design model that promotes meaningful learning of information system concepts, and problem solving skills for accounting information system students. This instructional design model incorporated concept mapping for visual representation of students' conceptual frameworks as they solved a complex real world case problem in virtual learning communities. The research design involved students in four accounting information systems courses, divided into control and experimental groups. The instructional course design model was used as the experimental groups' treatment and ANCOVA statistic was used to determine any significant difference in student approaches' to learning, problem solving ability, and conceptual understanding. The results indicated statistically significant positive increase in deep or meaningful approach along with an equally significant decrease in surface or superficial approach to learning for experimental groups. The study may influence how online course designers use innovative information technology to improve accountants' lifelong learning skill attainment and tenacity to detect business fraud and prevent financial scandals.

T1  - Psychosocial competency of the English as a second language nursing student: A comparative study
AN  - 304738318
AB  - Nurses must be capable of recognizing the client's psychosocial and physiological needs. The nurse's ability to do so impacts the outcome of the healthcare experience and may impact future health care encounters. English as a second language (ESL) nurses and non-ESL nurses must both be able to identify the client's psychosocial issues. Little information exists on the ESL students' ability to identify the client's psychosocial needs. This study compared the 459 psychosocial needs scores of 25,782 ESL and non-ESL senior nursing students who took the HESI exam between September 1, 2005 and August 31, 2006 to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and regression analysis were performed using SPSS 13.0.   Mean scores were 62.33 for the native English (non-ESL) examinees and 59.57 for the ESL group (p<.001). An ANOVA was conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean psychosocial needs scores of ESL and non-ESL HESI examinees based on age, gender, educational program (Bachelors vs. Associate Degree Program), and ethnicity. All variables were significant at p<.01. However the Eta2</super> was negligible, thus suggesting that there was a weak, but significant difference in psychosocial scores based on native language. Pearson's Product Moment Correlation(r) and Spearman's Rho were .058 and .069 respectively suggesting that native language was a weak correlate of psychosocial needs scores. The regression coefficient calculation was F(8,71)=10.05 (p<.001), but the Beta values of the regression analysis were small and negated the regression analysis. The limited effect size (Eta2), small partial correlation coefficients, and Beta values were secondary to the large study population.   The data suggests that ESL student's grasp of the client's psychosocial needs requires further study. Although underutilized in nursing education, concept maps have been used to teach psychosocial nursing and could be a possible solution for improving the ESL student's psychosocial needs scores.

T1  - Medical students' perceptions of the utility of concept mapping
AN  - 304722484
AB  - Concept mapping is being introduced into traditional medical education as a tool to help students integrate information and learn meaningfully. There is strong theoretical support for concept mapping, but studies have determined that a substantial proportion of students do not perceive concept mapping to be useful. 182 medical students at St. George's University took the Myers Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) and completed an original questionnaire examining student perceptions of concept mapping and perceptions of a range of factors which have been proposed to influence perceptions of the usefulness of the strategy. The results of this study provide support for the assertion that concept mapping can be a useful learning tool for some students, even in a traditional basic science medical curriculum. However, it also provides evidence that a substantial percent of students do not find concept mapping to be useful in this context. MBTI Personality type, perceptions of the learning environment and perceptions of the implementation of concept mapping were found to be related to perceptions of usefulness and use of the strategy.

T1  - Understanding how organizational values play into a framework of continuous improvement
AN  - 304719704
AB  - This is a qualitative study that uses insider action research methodology to investigate an educational service center's drive to create shared language around continuous improvement in order to better serve the various needs of the school districts with which they work. This dissertation chronicles the process through which nine educational consultants built a parallel system of integrated learning mechanisms to readily adapt to the changes mandated by the state board of education and No Child Left Behind (NCLB).    One of the unintended consequences that resulted from the beginning stages of this study was the emergence of an organizational values model. This emanated from the coded responses of Appreciative Inquiry interviews employed in order to identify the common narrative that holds the members of this organization together. The model consists of four components: Strategic Process, Collaboration, Communication, and Leadership. It was significant in that it not only provided the organization with a visual representation of its values, but also it guided them in their efforts of developing a strategic process for continuous improvement.    This dissertation contributes to the field of organization development because it provides insight to understanding the life giving properties of individuals, how these properties evolve into organizational values, how these values are manifested in behavior, and how this behavior forms the foundation for eliciting continual improvement.    Key terms. action research; insider action research; appreciative inquiry; organizational values; shared language; continuous improvement

T1  - Evaluation of collaborative systems to support a virtual enterprise.
AN  - 301690987
AB  - This research investigates the field of evaluation within IT, especially in evaluating collaborative systems.  The evaluation of collaborative systems does not simply involve the validation of those systems against specification, but also an understanding of collaborative group work.  The group is usually comprised of people from different organisations across countries or continents.  Due to the different organisational contexts, and the interaction and social activities between people, such evaluation therefore requires organisational integration, cooperation, and coordination with the organisational environment, the actors/stakeholders and the researchers.  An interpretive research paradigm is therefore adopted in this research.
  The thesis proposes a concept map for understanding collaborative system evaluation as well as a context framework for evaluation framework in virtual enterprises.  To meet the identified need from evaluators for support in applying an appropriate evaluation instrument, a Lifecycle-based Stakeholder-oriented approach is applied and refined in three case studies.
  The case studies were carried out in two European funded research projects and one academic Teacher Action Research project.  The case study results demonstrate the ability of the proposed frameworks and approach to assist in carrying out effective evaluations.  Moreover, the potential risks identified in the case studies can contribute to identifying critical success factors as references for successful system development, and collaborative work within a virtual team.  Reflection on the case studies brings to attention subjects to be addressed while conducting an evaluation, such as the influence of power and politics on evaluation activities and resources.  In addition, communication needs to receive more attention when managing a virtual team.  A further result of reflection on the outcomes of the two case studies of EU-funded projects is that in order for the impact of such projects to be better understood further research needs to be directed towards organisations' practices of knowledge management with respect to the results of projects.

T1  - Comparison of Middle School Student Performance on Photograph-Based Multiple-Choice Items and Text-Based Multiple-Choice Items on a State Science Achievement Test
AN  - 2675221810
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate how photograph-based life science multiple-choice items influenced Louisiana science students' performance on statewide standardized tests, in comparison with text-based items about the same content. This mixed methodology research study focused primarily on types of multiple-choice items, specifically five matched pairs of multiple-choice items, text-only and same-text with a photograph. For the 2007 LEAP field test, statistics from 11 multiple-choice items were utilized to characterize student performance on photograph-based multiple-choice items. Data from all Louisiana 8th grade students taking Form 3 (n=1130) and Form 4 (n=1182) were analyzed to compare student performance on each item type.Additional case study research was conducted in two schools. Within each school, one 8th grade class was exposed to the 20-Question Model (Wandersee, 2000) (treatment group); the remaining 8th grade classes were not (control group). Questionnaires were given to all 8th grade students at each school which focused on the student's experience when answering the field test questions with a photograph. In addition four eighth-grade students, who were contrasted on gender and on high or low academic performance, were interviewed and asked to co-construct six concept maps related to six different test items used in the study (four with photographs, two without photographs).The analysis of the quantitative data showed a significant difference on the heron item. There was a moderate positive correlation between achievement level and mean number correct on the photograph-based items (rs=.1536). The data show that students performing at low achievement levels benefited from the photograph-based item. The qualitative data analysis revealed positive student perception when working with photographs during classroom instruction and taking assessments. The student interviews and concept maps with the four students revealed students' conceptions and misconceptions about life science concepts.

T1  - Community College Students' Plant Biodiversity Learning Experience in an Introductory Biology Course: Exploring the Value Added by Using a CD-ROM to Develop Inquiry Lessons
AN  - 2674877274
AB  - This study examined the value added to standard textbook-based instruction of plant biodiversity by the use of the exemplary interactive CD-ROM, Conserving Earth’s Biodiversity. This CD-ROM features renowned conservation figure E.O. Wilson. The setting of the research was an introductory biology course in a rural public community college in the Deep South. Six participants were purposively selected to represent three levels of achievement and two groups, the CD-ROM group (exposed to CD-ROM in addition to the textbook) and the textbook group (only course textbook). Students experienced lecture-based, textual, virtual, and real experiences, and examined their ability to understand biodiversity-related concepts and to pursue guided-inquiry questions about local plant biodiversity. Their performance was assessed through activities, quizzes, concept maps, interviews, surveys, and students’ presentations.This study led to three main findings. First, use of the CD-ROM, in addition to the textbook, allowed students to form a well-rounded grasp of plant biodiversity. Second, use of the CD-ROM enhanced the development of inquiries on local plant biodiversity and the metacognitive phase of assigning roles for local plant diversity. Third, the Plant Biodiversity Literacy Rubric [PBLR] was developed, based upon the history of the concept of biodiversity and was used to evaluate students’ progress by assigning them to various levels of understanding during the study.The students in the CD-ROM group gained a broader perspective of plant biodiversity-related concepts, such as levels of biodiversity, hot spots, genetic diversity, food plant diversity, and threats to biodiversity. The CD-ROM was never detrimental to the learning process. They were more self-directed in their development of inquiries, felt more confident about their presentations, and were more metacognitive during their inquiries. Performance on specific activities such as the essay and The Golden List of Species suggested an enhanced cognitive-behavioral/affective experience for students in the CD-ROM group.The PBLR is an exportable instrument, which may allow ecology educators at all levels to assess student’s levels of understanding in a sensitive way. At this time, it is critical to gauge effective understanding of plant biodiversity and ecology education, as it is vital to the survival and well-being of life on Earth.

T1  - An investigation of the effects of interventions on problem-solving strategies and abilities
AN  - 305352637
AB  - Problem-solving has been described as being the "heart" of the chemistry classroom, and students' development of problem-solving skills is essential for their success in chemistry. Despite the importance of problem-solving, there has been little research within the chemistry domain, largely because of the lack of tools to collect data for large populations. Problem-solving was assessed using a software package known as IMMEX (for Interactive Multimedia Exercises) which has an HTML tracking feature that allows for collection of problem-solving data in the background as students work the problems. The primary goal of this research was to develop methods (known as interventions) that could promote improvements in students' problem-solving and most notably aid in their transition from the novice to competent level.    Three intervention techniques that were incorporated within the chemistry curricula: collaborative grouping (face-to-face and distance), concept mapping, and peer-led team learning. The face-to-face collaborative grouping intervention was designed to probe the factors affecting the quality of the group interaction. Students' logical reasoning abilities were measured using the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking (GALT) test which classifies students as formal, transitional, or concrete. These classifications essentially provide a basis for identifying scientific aptitude. These designations were used as the basis for forming collaborative groups of two students. The six possibilities (formal-formal, formal-transitional, etc.) were formed to determine how the group composition influences the gains in student abilities observed from collaborative grouping interventions. Students were given three assignments (an individual pre-collaborative, an individual post collaborative, and a collaborative assignment) each requiring them to work an IMMEX problem set. Similar gains in performance of 10% gains were observed for each group with two exceptions. The transitional students who were paired with concrete students had a 15% gain, and the concrete students paired with other concrete students had only a marginal gain. In fact, there was no statistical difference in the pre-collaborative and post-collaborative student abilities for concrete-concrete groups.    The distance collaborative intervention was completed using a new interface for the IMMEX software designed to mimic face-to-face collaboration. A stereochemistry problem set which had a solved rate of 28% prior to collaboration was chosen for incorporation into this distance collaboration study. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Understanding of earth and space science concepts: Strategies for concept building in elementary teacher preparation
AN  - 305336991
AB  - Research on conceptual change provides strong evidence that not only children but also many adults have incorrect or incomplete understanding of science concepts. This mixed methods study was concerned with preservice and inservice teachers' understanding of six earth and space science concepts commonly taught in elementary school: reasons for seasons, phases of the moon, reasons for the wind, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. The first part of the study determined and compared the level of conceptual understanding held by both groups on topics they will need to teach in the Georgia Performance Standards [GPS]. The second part focused on whether readings or hands-on learning stations, in some cases combined with concept mapping, improves preservice teachers' understanding of these concepts. The third part described the application of conceptual change strategies of one group of preservice teachers during their field placements. The overall sample was two cohorts of preservice teachers, one cohort of preservice teachers from an alternative initial certification program, and two masters' cohorts consisting of inservice teachers. Four data sources were: a six item open-ended survey, concept maps, the field assignments, and the researcher's field notes. Rubrics were used to score answers to each survey question. Concept map scores were calculated based on the criteria developed by Novak and Gowin (1984).    The first part of the study shows that both preservice and inservice teachers have low conceptual understanding of the earth science concepts taught in elementary school. Independent samples t-tests results indicate that both groups have similar understanding about these concepts. A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. A paired samples t-test shows that concept mapping added to the participants' conceptual understanding whether the participants learned the concepts through readings or stations. Finally, field assignments allowed the participants to apply knowledge that they learned in their science methods course in their classroom placements. This study has implications for teacher preparation programs, staff development, and conceptual change practices in field placements.

T1  - Meaningful school leadership from the perspective of African American parents
AN  - 305332975
AB  - This study explored leadership as defined and conceptualized by African American parents whose children were attending public school in This City where the study took place. This group was targeted because their voices are not dominant in the leadership literature and their children lag behind academically. Three questions guided the study: How do the lived experiences of African American parents shape their perceptions of leadership? In what ways do African American parents consider notions of race and racism as it relates to leadership, in particular school leadership? What themes emerge in African American parents' descriptions of the leadership that improves the academic achievement for their children?   The study used qualitative methodology relying on individual in-depth and open-ended interviews to elicit personal narratives of their experiences of school leadership. The parents' individual experiences were described and their collective experiences were derived from thematic analyses. A concept map was constructed to depict the common elements of the African American parents' descriptions of leadership. Based on what African American parents believe is best for their children, their experiences and Critical Race Theory, the term meaningful leadership evolved. Themes from the individual parents' narratives were: (a) dismantling the status quo, (b) diversity, (c) vision, (d) engaging lessons, (e) communication and team building, (f) policy, (g) attitude towards good leaders, (h) attitudes toward children, (i) attitude of teaching and (j) attitude toward excellence. In the end, the parents' experiences called for meaningful leadership that would close the achievement gap and dismantle the status quo in the system.

T1  - Food safety training as adult education: Determining prior knowledge in the service of scientific conceptual change
AN  - 305316808
AB  - A common recommendation for addressing the serious issue of foodborne illness is to train foodservice managers to handle and store foods safely. Typically, food safety education is considered successful when managers become certified through such programs as ServSafe®, which is offered by Cooperative Extension and other organizations. However, sustained behavior change has been limited. The research contributed to understanding the nature of the limitations of current programs, toward betterment of food safety education. The goals of the research was to describe the type and extent of conceptual understandings possessed by trained and certified foodservice workers of scientific principles relevant to preventing foodborne illnesses, specifically, the role of heat and thermal dynamics in cooling foods. The theoretical framework informing the research combined science education's conceptual change model and adult education's transformational learning theory. Both theories posit that knowledge is more widely applied, more easily transferred to novel contexts, and more robust when learners develop conceptual understandings of scientific concepts versus algorithmic, rule-based knowledge. Both theories emphasize the necessity of learners connecting new knowledge to prior knowledge, experiences, and personal perspectives. Applying these theories to food safety curriculum and instruction had been explored very little. Methods included semi-structured interviews (with visual prompts and physical models), observations, document analysis, and concept mapping with 18 cooks at two Midwest hospitals. The study confirmed that neither managers nor workers were able to convey an understanding of cooling beyond routine practices associated with on-the-job training. Overlaid with Bloom's taxonomy of the cognitive domain, data also showed that understandings of the role of heat in cooling was situated at lower levels compared to knowledge about heat in cooking. Consistent with adult education literature, employees' personal identity as a 'cook' strongly influenced food safety knowledge and practices. Results explained, in part, the poor uptake of conventional training. Recommendations included increasing employees' motivation to learn scientific concepts by tapping their desire to be better cooks instead of forcing a new identity of ‘food safety workers'; increasing problem-solving abilities across contexts by teaching principles instead of rule-based behaviors; and involving all employees, not just managers, in food safety educational experiences.

T1  - Student conceptions of groundwater
AN  - 305316493
AB  - Students come to formal science instruction with prior knowledge about natural phenomena. This phenomenographic study identified concepts students have about the structures and processes that define the concept of groundwater. Semi-clinical interviews of 18 high school seniors and two soil scientists were conducted. The interview involved responding to five different tasks. The interview was designed to elicit a broad range of concepts about how water interacts with and below the surface. Concept maps were developed for each respondent, and interview text was analyzed to identify the concepts respondents used to define the concept of groundwater.    Students used 23 categories to express concepts related to groundwater. Students expressed the concepts of pipes (N=2), bricks (N=4), open space (N=4), body of water (N=5), a drain (N=2), a water facility (N=1) and soil pore space (N=2). Students identified that the origin of groundwater as rain (N=13), a lake or river (N=4), and trucks (N=1). The study also identified concepts students used to express water properties, the transmission of water from the surface and soil properties.    Student concepts were compared to the scientifically accepted perspective, as analyzed by interviews with two soil scientists and groundwater literature. Only two students agreed with the soil science concept that groundwater is stored in soil pore space. Scientists' concepts were also more focused and had a more limited range of ways of expressing groundwater than the students. Comparisons of student groups showed no trends, with advanced science students and students with less science holding similar concepts.    Implications of the results of this study for science education suggest that most students are not graduating understanding the scientifically accepted concept of groundwater, which will have implications for students' future decision making about their environment, especially since 51% of the United States accesses groundwater for drinking. This study provides information about the student's prior knowledge about groundwater so science education can design instruction and curriculum to accommodate changes to the concepts identified in the study.

T1  - Mental models students hold of zoos
AN  - 305282822
AB  - The purpose of this study was to depict the mental models high school students, ages 14-18, hold of zoos. This study also examined how students define conservation and the role of zoos in conservation. This study examined the differences in mental models of 84 students (1) 21 students who had visited a zoo with their teacher in the same semester in which the study was conducted, (2) 21 students who had visited a zoo during another school year with their teacher, (3) 21 students who had visited the zoo without a teacher, and (4) 21 students who had never visited a zoo. It also examined the mental models of students of different ethnicities and examined differences in mental models of young men and women.    This study was conducted and the data analyzed using a qualitative methodology research design. All 84 students completed a demographic questionnaire, a concept map, and a ranking concepts exercise. Twenty-four students were interviewed.    The findings indicated that: (1) students who had visited a zoo have a richer mental model of zoos than students who have never visited a zoo, (2) students who had visited a zoo with their teacher provided a deeper richer understanding of the roles of zoos in conservation and education, (3) students who have never visited a zoo do have mental models of zoos, (4) students do not mention conservation with respect to zoos unless specifically asked about the role of zoos in conservation, and (5) students did not mention the zoo's connection to species survival nor did they view zoos as a source of information for conservation-related topics.   The data indicated that the mental models student hold of zoos consist of seven themes: (1) organisms, (2) people, (3) amenities, (4) descriptive terms, (5) habitats, (6) education, and (7) conservation. The seven themes were defined and used to create the Zoo Acuity Model. The central constructs of the Zoo Acuity Model are the Observation Framework, the Interaction Framework, and the Information Framework. Most important to this study is the development of the Information Framework, which described the information students knew about zoos.

T1  - “The impossible made possible”: A method for measuring change in conceptual understanding in undergraduate science students
AN  - 305270830
AB  - This study examined change in conceptual knowledge of scientific concepts at the undergraduate level by using concept mapping to assess student understanding. Recent reports from science educators and researchers indicate an acute need to enhance student conceptual understanding in science. This suggests that faculty need to investigate whether actual student learning matches their goals for enhancing conceptual understanding. The study design incorporated the use of both qualitative and quantitative methods to analyze change in student conceptual understanding. The sample population consisted of a total of 61 students, 47 science majors and 14 non-majors from ten different classrooms at seven separate institutions of higher education across the United States. Student concept maps were constructed, by the researcher, from the transcripts of structured interviews with the student participants. Analysis of the concept maps was correlated with other quantitative data, such as course grades and the Learning and Studying Questionnaire (LSQ). The LSQ is a well-established survey instrument that measures student learning based on the use of rote and/or conceptual learning techniques. Results indicate that concept maps provide more information than grades alone because they represented individual understanding, in terms of depth of understanding, relationships between concepts, quality of knowledge organization and identification of misconceptions. Thus, differences in student comprehension of course material, with respect to critical concepts, could be analyzed. The greatest determinant of increased conceptual understanding over the course of a semester was the student's self-report of approaches to learning and studying. The quality of the student maps, in turn, was reflective of differences in student approaches to learning. Concomitantly, the concept maps reflected student gains in content and depth over a semester with respect to an expert map. The results also suggest that the level of faculty-student interaction is also associated with enhancing student conceptual understanding. The understanding of key concepts serves an important role in helping students integrate their understanding and facilitates future learning. By aiming to evaluate an assessment method for accurately measuring student conceptual knowledge this research melded aspects of curricular reform such as instruction, assessment techniques, faculty development and policy implementation.

T1  - A phenomenographic case study: Concept maps from the perspectives of middle school students
AN  - 305266293
AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the experiences of middle school students when concept maps were used as a learning tool. Twenty-nine students' written responses, concept maps and videotapes were analyzed. Out of 29 students, thirteen students were interviewed using a semi-structured and open-ended interview protocol. The students' initial written responses provided us with the students' initial reactions to concept maps. The videotapes captured the students' behavior, and interpersonal interactions. The interviews probed students': (1) knowledge about drawing concept maps, (2) perception of the meaning and usefulness of concept maps, and (3) attitudes towards concept maps. The results indicated that the students viewed concept maps as useful tools in learning science. They believed that concept maps organized and summarized the information, which thereby helped them understand the topic easily. They also believed that concept maps had some cognitive benefits. However, the students viewed concept maps as hard to construct because it was difficult for the students to think of related concepts. The students' initial written responses, interviews and videotapes indicated that the students seemed to see both positive and negative aspects of concept maps. Some students' had more positive and some had more negative attitudes.

T1  - The influence of continuous concept map construction on the information seeking process
AN  - 304989196
AB  - Research into the information search process reveals that most college students struggle as they write research papers, and they particularly have difficulties in forming a focus. In order to help college students focus their research topics and conduct research in an iterative fashion, the researcher developed a scaffold she named continuous concept map construction (CCMC), and investigated its influence on college students' information seeking processes as they engaged in writing research papers.    A mixture of methods was used to collect data from 15 students and four English instructors whose students were involved in the study. The data collected from students included three sets of concept maps, 15 research papers, and two questionnaire results. These were analyzed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, pattern analysis, and two information-use rubrics, respectively. The English instructors were interviewed and the interview transcripts were analyzed using content analysis.    The data agreed strongly on the usefulness of CCMC in facilitating the students' information seeking processes. The final research papers generated by the students scored well in selecting relevant information to support their theses and using information to achieve focused topics.    The contributions of this study included the following. First, a typology was developed based on the recurring patterns to analyze the student-constructed concept maps. Second, different patterns of topic development, structure evolution, and shape change were identified in the student-constructed concept maps that reflected different ways in which students formed a focus and developed their ideas. Furthermore, the usefulness of CCMC in helping college students focus their research was initially established. The findings suggest that CCMC helped students in terms of narrowing their research topics, staying focused with their research, organizing and integrating the information collected, and developing research papers with focused topics. Lastly, guidelines were derived for further use of CCMC to foster information literacy in educational settings.

T1  - Professional development strategies for teaching urban biology teachers to use concept maps effectively
AN  - 304937881
AB  - Many teachers are not adequately prepared to help urban students who have trouble understanding conceptual ideas in biology because these students have little connection to the natural world. This study explored potential professional development strategies to help urban biology teachers use concept maps effectively with various topics in the biology curriculum. A grounded theory approach was used to develop a substantive professional development model for urban biology teachers. Qualitative data were collected through 16 semi-structured interviews of professional developers experienced in working with concept maps in the urban context. An anonymous online survey was used to collect quantitative data from 56 professional developers and teachers to support the qualitative data. The participants were from New York City, recruited through the NY Biology-Chemistry Professional Development Mentor Network and the NY Biology Teachers' Association. According to the participants, map construction, classroom applications, lesson planning, action research, follow-up workshops, and the creation of learning communities are the most effective professional development strategies. The interviewees also proposed English language learning strategies such as picture maps, native word maps, and content reading materials with underlined words. This study contributes to social change by providing a professional development model to use in planning workshops for urban teachers. Urban teachers improve their own conceptual understanding of biology while learning how to implement concept mapping strategies in the classroom. Students whose teachers are better prepared to teach biology in a conceptual manner have the potential of growing into more scientifically literate citizens.

T1  - The comparative effect of individually-generated vs. collaboratively-generated computer -based concept mapping on science concept learning
AN  - 304934101
AB  - Using a quasi-experimental design, the researcher investigated the comparative effects of individually-generated and collaboratively-generated computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. Qualitative data were analyzed to explain quantitative findings.    One hundred sixty-one students (74 boys and 87 girls) in eight, seventh grade science classes at a middle school in Southeast Texas completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, the researcher assigned the teacher’s classes to one of the three experimental groups. The independent variable, group, consisted of three levels: 40 students in a control group, 59 students trained to individually generate concept maps on computers, and 62 students trained to collaboratively generate concept maps on computers. The dependent variables were science concept learning as demonstrated by comprehension test scores, and quality of concept maps created by students in experimental groups as demonstrated by rubric scores.    Students in the experimental groups received concept mapping training and used their newly acquired concept mapping skills to individually or collaboratively construct computer-based concept maps during study time. The control group, the individually-generated concept mapping group, and the collaboratively-generated concept mapping group had equivalent learning experiences for 50 minutes during five days, excepting that students in a control group worked independently without concept mapping activities, students in the individual group worked individually to construct concept maps, and students in the collaborative group worked collaboratively to construct concept maps during their study time.    Both collaboratively and individually generated computer-based concept mapping had a positive effect on seventh grade middle school science concept learning but neither strategy was more effective than the other. However, the students who collaboratively generated concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually generated concept maps. The researcher concluded that the concept mapping software, Inspiration™, fostered construction of students’ concept maps individually or collaboratively for science learning and helped students capture their evolving creative ideas and organize them for meaningful learning. Students in both the individual and the collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration™ software.

T1  - The effect of concept mapping on critical thinking skills and dispositions of junior and senior baccalaureate nursing students
AN  - 304920077
AB  - Teaching and assessing critical thinking have great professional benefit to nursing education (Daley, 1996, Facione, 1996). Major issues still center on and are discussed by nurse educators about the importance of teaching strategies that enhance critical thinking skills and measurements of critical thinking (Adams, 1999; Daley, Shaw, & Balistrieri, 1999; Facione & Facione, 1997). The purposes of this quasi experimental study, using a pretest-posttest control group design were twofold. The first purpose was to explore the effect of concept mapping, as a metacognitive teaching strategy on the critical thinking skills and dispositions of junior and senior level baccalaureate nursing students. The second purpose was to evaluate the changes in students' concept mapping skills over time. This research was based upon David Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning (1968) and Joseph Novak and Bob Gowin's (1984) work on the application of meaningful learning using concept mapping. The convenience sample included 32 students in the experimental group and 45 students in the control group. The participants were enrolled in accredited generic baccalaureate nursing programs. The students in the experimental group developed two concept maps over the course of a full academic semester. The California Critical Skills Test (CCTST) and the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) were used to measure the variables. Novak and Gowin's (1984) scoring criteria were used to score the concept maps. The pretest scores of the two groups did not differ significantly. The experimental and control groups did not differ on CCTST or CCTDI posttest scores. There was no relationship between critical thinking skills and dispositions scores. Nursing students who used concept mapping showed no increase in their CCTST and CCTDI on posttest scores. The first concept maps showed fewer concepts, and less connecting of concepts than the second concept maps, supporting Ausabel's Meaningful Learning Theory. The findings of this study suggest that concept mapping triggers critical thinking, which guides the student to engage in meaningful learning. However, the need still exists for researchers to use other critical thinking tools that may capture students' growth of critical thinking over time.

T1  - An enterprise architecture process incorporating knowledge modeling methods
AN  - 304917293
AB  - Today's enterprise managers face the challenge of sifting through overwhelming amounts of disparate information in order to piece together meaningful assessments of market conditions, product and service delivery obligations, and enterprise resource situations in a timely fashion. An enterprise architecture is one way of presenting a "big picture" view of the enterprise. As such, the architecture can present disparate information in an organized set of views tailored to management issues and concerns. However, many detailed architectures have a very large amount of information that makes it difficult to construct and to use. To alleviate this problem, managers need an architecture based on knowledge constructs that organizes the information in a more coherent and relevant manner. The manager needs to see only that information that is directly relevant to the business questions of the moment.    This dissertation presents a unique methodology for building a knowledge-based enterprise architecture model that incorporates knowledge modeling methods. This problem-focused, question-based (PFQB) process consists of six steps: problem framing, metamodel development, data collection, model development, architecture deployment, and architecture utilization. The PFQB process incorporates five knowledge modeling methods: business questions, knowledge steps, entity relationship diagrams, concept maps, and class diagrams. The following process artifacts are generated: business question list, detailed question list, survey forms, survey database, conceptual schema, metamodel specification, architecture framework, model template, and enterprise model. The enterprise architectural model is used for identification and assessment of enterprise management concerns and issues.

T1  - An architecture for augmenting the SCORM run -time environment with a personalised link service
AN  - 304905913
AB  - As the result of recent advances in the business of e-learning there has been a growing interest in e-learning standards, particularly SCORM (Sharable Content Object Reference Model). SCORM is a reference model that integrates a collection of e-learning resource standards and specifications. In a SCORM compliant courseware, content and the pedagogic approach to be taken are predefined by the course author. As a consequence, users are unable to learn according to their preferences, and implicitly they will all encounter the same learning experience. Recent attempts to personalise learning in SCORM often resulted in either modifying SCORM or substituting its course sequencing mechanism with Adaptive Hypermedia techniques. Nonetheless, SCORM is a widely-used solution to interoperability problems with elearning resources and can realise not only content sharing and reusability but also a consistent sequencing of course content across different systems and tools. For these reasons, this thesis focuses on supplementing SCORM sequencing rather than redefining it. The novelty of this work is that it builds an adaptive environment around the existing SCORM, without extending or modifying SCORM itself. The work integrates Adaptive Hypermedia principles into the SCORM Run-Time Environment as an independent service to support the environment with learning materials that are preferable to both teachers (primary materials of their choice) and students (supplementary materials that are pre-selected to suit some aspects of their user models to assist their understanding of the primary materials). This SCORM-complementing approach can also enable the SCORM Run-Time Environment to include on-demand external resources into the environment in order to address SCORM's limitation of static pool of learning resources.    The novel contribution of this work is the design of an authoring architecture which enables the automatic generation of a concept map and consequently links to alternative learning resources, and a run-time service oriented architecture which delivers these alternative resources, alongside the SCORM defined resources, according to a dynamic user model.

T1  - An exploration of the factors influencing the decisions of British Asian girls to study science A-levels.
AN  - 301661932
AB  - A study of 16/17 year old British Asian and White British girls explored how young people in Britain create identities and make educational choices through them, in the context of choosing to study post-16 Science courses that lead to university entrance.
  Phase 1 of the study focused on the decision process and the cultural specificity of factors contributing to the decision.  It involved Asian and non-Asian, female and male Science teachers and female Science and non-Science students.  The methodology included semi-structured interviews, focus groups, card sorts and other self-developed techniques.
  Phase 2 focused on gaining insights into what self-identified factors, life themes and experiences developed positive Science identities and how these related to other identities.  It involved three groups of Science students at two schools.  A novel conceptual framework, using Multiple Self Awareness Theory, was developed for this and its usefulness for understanding young people and their decisions was assessed.  The methodology included autobiographies and concept mapping.
  Findings suggest that the resolution of tensions, between different selves and different societal contexts, is an everyday path of negotiation for young British Asian girls.  The contexts of localised cultures are present in their lives, but their decisions are guided by universal factors.

T1  - A Strategic Approach Developing an Interactive Multimedia Learning System for Young Learners (Learning Malay Proverb)
AN  - 2877962752
AB  - Research conducted by local linguistic shows that the grasp of Malay Proverbs among younger generation is deteriorating. This dissertation proposes a strategic approach to Jearn Malay proverbs through interactive multimedia learning system for young learners. This approach employs effective learning strategy that proves its usability to help young learners understand and remember better. The arrangement of how young learners’ mind work reflects the stages of human cognition: immediate apprehension, abstract thinking and practice. The three stages are formulated into three steps approach: knowing, understanding and usage. All these three stages are then used to create instructional objective, content and the test items by using rapid prototyping model. Appropriate user interface design was created based on the storyboard, After the implementation, final evaluation was conducted using two methods. The predictive evaluation was conducted by allowing a multimedia designer to use the system. It was concluded that more extensive instructions are needed in order to let the system to be 100% independent. The observing and monitoring usage method showed that 70% of the young learners could perform each task smoothly. The remaining 30% could perform it afer they finished the first two units. The system was also evaluated on its learning strategy. 80% of the students found that the three steps approach was easy to follow while the remaining 20% could cope after further elaboration was given.

T1  - Exploring attitudes and difficulties in school chemistry in the emirates
AN  - 1793935966
AB  - In the first stage of this project, the areas of difficulty for students were identified, using a sample of 490 students aged between 15-17 years. The main areas of difficulty for year 10 were: chemical formula, quantum number, periodic table of elements, lanthanides and actinides and chemical equations. For year 11, the main areas of difficulty were: male calculation, chemical equation balance, homologous series, isomerism, alkyl groups and pH and pOH calculation. In the second stage, students were then asked for comments on the areas of difficulty and, later, took a short test using structural communication grids, these offering insights into areas of confusion and misconceptions. For the third stage of this project, attitudes relating to chemistry were measured using questionnaires, this being conducted with 225 students aged 15-17 years. The surveys and questionnaires revealed a clear picture of the situation in chemistry in the Emirates showing fairly negative attitudes, probably mainly as a result of an overcrowded and largely irrelevant curriculum taught by very didactic approaches which took little account of the psychology of learning. The core of the study involved the development of four units of paper-based teaching material. These were designed specifically to meet two sets of criteria. Firstly, the predictions from information processing determined the way the material was presented so that student learning was likely to be enhanced. Secondly, the evidence from attitude development informed the design with the aim that positive attitudes towards studies in chemistry would be encouraged. The way the units were used and the way they were tested is described, this work also being carried out with students in years 10 and 11 (age 16-17 approximately) in typical schools in the Emirates. For this stage, a total sample of 800 students boys and girls aged between 16-17 years in Emirates secondary schools participated. Each unit of work lasted for about 6-8 weeks. The testing involved a number of approaches including structural communication grids, open-ended questions and, with one unit, the development of a concept map. Attitudes to numerous aspects of the processes involved in learning chemistry were also explored. The performance of the students was found to be markedly better than control groups, the t-test values being significant at around p < 0.001. Numerous attitude comparisons were made using the chi-square statistic. Here, extremely high values were obtained, indicating quite massive attitude changes had taken place. The insights offered by the study are summarised and the possibilities for future work are also outlined. The whole study arose from a concern that students in the Emirates often seemed to have poor attitudes towards their studies in chemistry and that many were rejecting chemistry as a subject to pursue. This study has provided illumination on the problem and, on the basis of the evidence obtained, suggests possible ways forward to a better approach to the study of what is an important school discipline, the outcomes being widely applicable in many countries.

T1  - Pre-play negotiations, learning and Nash equilibrium
AN  - 1428389517
AB  - A solution concept maps strategic games into strategy predictions. Nash equilibrium is the most widely used solution concept in game theory. Three main explanations have been used to argue why players should end up playing Nash equilibrium: 1) introspective reasoning, 2) communication 3) learning. Careful study of these has shown that the case for the Nash equilibrium is not entirely unambiguous. In this thesis, we conclude with new insights into why Nash equilibrium may be too restrictive a prediction in the context of pre-play communication and learning. Experiments suggest that communication increases the contribution to public goods. There is also evidence that, when contemplating a lie, people trade off their private benefit from the lie with the harm it inflicts on others. In the first chapter, we develop a theory of bilateral pre-play negotiation that assumes the latter and implies the former. We show that a preference for not lying enables non-Nash outcomes. In symmetric games, pre-play negotiations crucially depend on whether actions are strategic complements or substitutes. With strategic substitutes commitment power tends to decrease in efficiency whereas the opposite may be true with strategic complements. In the second chapter we consider negotiation with an alternating offer protocol. As opposed to previous contributions we show that impatience may be beneficial for a player. In the third chapter we illustrate how the complexity of conjectures about opponents' strategies in the analogy-based expectation equilibrium (ABEE) corresponds to various other equilibrium concepts in the learning literature. We also introduce a payoff- confirming refinement of the ABEE where the sample of own payoffs induced by the true equilibrium strategies must confirm the conjectures about opponents' strategies. We show that there may be non-Bayesian-Nash payoff-confirming ABEE. We provide a sufficient condition for this and show that the condition is also necessary in an interesting class of games.

T1  - GeoAgent-based Knowledge Systems
AN  - 305453727
AB  - Modern geography focuses on studying processes. In addition to observed phenomena, the study of geographic processes must (and does) place emphasis on understanding how components interact within geographic systems. As a fundamental tool for geographic representation and spatial analysis, current GISystems (geographic information systems) are nevertheless still data centered. While they are good at representing “what” and “where” information, they have limited capabilities in representing higher-level knowledge. This is because in the current GISystems there is a lack of means of capturing and representing human understanding of geographic processes to address “how” and “why” questions. In addition, non-observational factors such as laws, policies, regulations, plans, and cultural elements (e.g. religions, customs) cannot be easily represented.    Instead of the traditional data-centered approach, this dissertation presents a knowledge-oriented strategy for the representation of geographic processes. To reach that end, two major steps are adopted: (1) introducing the concept of GeoAgents as the spatiotemporally distributed knowledge-representation components, and (2) presenting an integrated approach to incorporate multiple knowledge-representation techniques with geospatial databases. GeoAgents are defined in this dissertation as spatial, dynamic, and scale-dependent agents within an explicitly geographic context. By incorporating GeoAgents with graph-based concept maps, rule-based expert systems, quantitative models, and geospatial databases, this research develops a Java-based prototype—GeoAgent-based Knowledge System (GeoAgentKS)—that allows the representations of diverse kinds of geographic knowledge and spatial data to be integrated in a single cohesive software system.   To examine the knowledge-oriented strategy of geographic representation in real-world problems, GeoAgentKS are employed in a case study to represent the complex geographic processes relevant to community water systems (CWSs) in Central Pennsylvania. In this case study, geographic knowledge is captured via interpretation of the pre-existing documents and computer-based-concept-mapping interviews with domain experts. To evaluate the usability of GeoAgentKS, evaluation interviews with different experts and novices were conducted to assess the adequacy of the knowledge representation and the effectiveness in conveying knowledge. The experts in the evaluation interviews believed that it was possible to use the GeoAgentKS to represent the complex, dynamic and scale-dependent human-environment interactions. And the knowledge stored in the GeoAgentKS could be quickly learned by novices.

T1  - The efficacy of concept mapping in aural skills training
AN  - 305452756
AB  - It was the purpose of this study to explore if there is a more effective way to practice aural skills, one that could be individualized as well as computer based: a method of practice that would enhance what the instructor does in the classroom and help the student reinforce their recognition of the basic elements of aural skills and dictation. Concept mapping, which has been beneficial in other educational settings, especially math and science, might be such a way. The goal of this study was to examine if this procedure could be applied to aural stimuli in the same way it has been applied to verbal information.    Sixty-four students in a first year college aural skills class were randomly assigned to two groups. Following a pretest of twenty-five chords randomly chosen from a pool of fifty, one group was presented with a lesson on concept mapping while listening to the chords and the other group received a distractor task. The results of these tests showed a higher gain score for the treatment group, M = 5.33, than for the control group, M = 1.25. An Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), showed a moderately significant gain of p = .030 (one-tailed) for the treatment group. Overall, the test results indicated a positive effect of the treatment on the ability of the participants to recognize chords in the posttest. Due to the limitations in the present study, more research is suggested to determine the effectiveness of the process.

T1  - Analysis of students' mental models: Using the Internet in an authentic learning situation
AN  - 305428344
AB  - Amid the pervasiveness of the Internet in schools, library media specialists need to know how students use the Internet to complete research assignments. Early studies of full-text electronic databases by Edyburn (1988) and Marchionini (1989) suggested useful concepts to extend the theoretical framework of the Kuhlthau Information Search Process (ISP). This study was undertaken to explore Internet use from the perspective of the student user. Specifically, it was designed to uncover what mental models students held of the Task, of themselves as an information searcher and of the Internet while working through an authentic learning project.    Data were gathered at three points in time from two classes of students via focus group interviews and concept maps. Humanities students worked on a self-generated project; the Science students worked on imposed project in addition to self-generated projects.    The findings show that the students' models were both complex and interrelated. The model of the Task shows students carrying out a mix of both Cognitive and Procedural subtasks. Often students were simultaneously working at more than one level of the Task as measured by both stage of the ISP and cognitive level of Bloom's Taxonomy. Students often experienced difficulty due to both the Cognitive Subtasks and Social Aspects of the Task.    Although students used the Internet, they relied on other sources of information, especially experts. Students held conflicting and complementary ideas about the Internet's usefulness. Their search strategies varied and were often unspoken. Their use of the Internet for communication was universally assumed. Students tolerated perceived shortcomings of the Internet and did not label it as a difficulty.    In most cases the students' mental model of the Self included strong opinions regarding information sources or depictions of information gathering procedures in addition to personal characteristics. Of all the students' personal qualities, Motivation was both the most thoroughly discussed and the most likely to be a source of difficulty particularly in relation to the imposed projects.    Future research could explore simultaneous activity at different stages of the ISP, uncover students' rules for information seeking and use concept maps as a method to elicit personal constructs.

T1  - A middle-range theory to guide the promotion, support, or improvement of spiritually -sensitive care in hospital settings
AN  - 305428154
AB  - In spite of a significant body of scholarship and numerous policy recommendations to promote spiritually sensitive health care, many factors block the full realization of this goal. Barriers include inadequate administrative support of professional chaplaincy services, discomfort and uncertainty among licensed medical practitioners, and conflicting public policies.    The purpose of this study was to develop a middle-range theory to elucidate the potentially helpful and feasible actions related to law, policy, and society that can be implemented to promote, support, or improve spiritually sensitive care in hospital settings.    The grounded theory method of inquiry was used. Grounded theory is a qualitative, inductive process that leads to the emergence of middle-range theory out of the data collected from observation, experience, and reflection. Data were analyzed using the concept-mapping system created by Concept Systems, Inc.® to generate a series of maps to illustrate the theoretical model that emerged. Twenty-six licensed medical professionals volunteered to participate in this study. Each met the inclusion criteria, which required at least one unit of clinical pastoral education or other training in pastoral care and work experience in a hospital setting within the last seven years.    The resulting middle-range theory represents the collective opinions of this sample of clinicians who share the “insider” view of the challenges faced in addressing the spiritual needs of patients in hospital settings. Using this theoretical framework to guide decision-making related to research, education, and scholarship will help to ensure that future work occurs in a logical and efficient manner, enabling scholars, policymakers, and clinicians to address what are perceived to be the most helpful and feasible next steps.

T1  - The lived experiences of lesbians over 50 as patients in primary healthcare settings
AN  - 305425349
AB  - With the overall aging population in the U.S., it is anticipated that a significant proportion of elder Americans, including lesbians, have health conditions that warrant an increased understanding of geriatric healthcare experiences. Few studies have examined the primary healthcare experiences of aging lesbians. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the lived experiences of lesbians over the age of 50 as patients in primary healthcare settings.    Using North American, descriptive phenomenology, principles of concept mapping and purposive sampling techniques, interviews were conducted with 15 lesbians over the age of 50. All women were U.S. citizens and had been patients in a primary healthcare setting at least one time in their adult lives. Four themes emerged from the data. They included patterns of disclosure, experiences of homophobia and heterosexism, experiences of ageism and visions of an ideal provider. While findings were consistent with previous research, two overarching themes became evident. First, lesbians over 50 are virtually invisible in primary healthcare settings. Second, over the years, the healthcare system has remained static by doing little to understand the growing needs of this population thus providing culturally incompetent care.    Using the Culturally Competent Model of Care developed by Campinha-Bacote implications for healthcare practice and education include increasing awareness and knowledge of the needs of lesbians over 50, addressing homophobia and heterosexism in healthcare settings, and creating learning experiences to improve skill and extend competent care to diverse populations. Recommendations for future research include incorporating a variety of phenomenological philosophies and methods to investigate the research question, exploring the concepts of homophobia and heterosexism and employing Structural Equation Modeling to investigate the relationships between the identified themes. All recommendations have the potential to make lesbians over 50 visible, thus potentially improving their well-being.

T1  - Design guidelines for developing scaffolded, handheld software to support learners during science inquiry
AN  - 305424819
AB  - The Mobile Learning Tools for Science (MaLTS) project developed design guidelines for building scaffolded, handheld software to support learners during science inquiry projects. The MaLTS project consisted of three phases of work. In Phase 1 (Analysis), related research from Learner-Centered Design and User-Centered Design was analyzed to identify the underlying challenge of designing handheld software to support learners during science inquiry. The design challenge resulting from Phase 1 was “How can we balance learners' need for scaffolds with the need to make handheld software easy to use?”    Phase 2 (Design and Implementation) addressed the design challenge from Phase 1 by developing three design guidelines for building handheld software that provided scaffolds and was easy to use. Using these design guidelines, three handheld tools were also developed during Phase 2: Pocket PiCoMap, to support concept mapping; ArtemisExpress, to support online research; and Pocket Model-It, to support scientific modeling.    Phase 3 (Evaluation and Reformulation) focused on determining whether the design guidelines developed during Phase 2 effectively addressed the design challenge articulated during Phase 1. In order for the design guidelines to be successful, handheld software built according to the design guidelines needed to be easy to use and needed to provide helpful scaffolding. To evaluate whether using the design guidelines resulted in handheld software that was easy to use and helpful to students, Pocket PiCoMap, ArtemisExpress and Pocket Model-It were used during a classroom study. The results of the classroom study highlighted several areas where the design guidelines could be reformulated to better address the design challenge. The reformulated design guidelines for building scaffolded, handheld software were the final results of the MaLTS project.    The MaLTS project demonstrated the viability of including scaffolds in handheld software for learners, and the design guidelines resulting from this project could be used to guide the development of a variety of handheld software for learners. Future work might explore the design of learner-centered handheld tools that take advantage of new features and peripherals, such as expanded wireless Internet access, mobile phones, powerful processors, removable storage, and scientific probeware.

T1  - Live, virtual, and constructive environments for performance support
AN  - 305419794
AB  - As military systems become more complex, the operation and support of these systems becomes intrinsically more difficult. The U.S. Army's current procurement process relies on industry to provide embedded training and performance support tools for the systems they produce. These tools are relatively new and in the early stages of development. As yet, they have failed to meet the needs of the technicians that are required to support these complex systems. Current efforts to provide enabling technologies that enhance the capabilities of automotive maintenance technicians are concentrated in three professional communities. First is the Performance Improvement community where work is focused on developing and implementing performance support system technologies that deliver information that is stored in information systems. Second is the Knowledge Management community working on organizational knowledge management techniques that capture, store, and map information that is delivered to workers within an organization. The third is the Training and Education community focusing on developing curriculum and delivery systems that support “life-long-learning” requirements.    This dissertation addresses an essential component of performance systems, namely the ability to deliver the knowledge needed to guide a problem solver to a solution state, thereby enhancing worker capabilities. This objective is met by developing the LockTel Framework that provides a construct for segmenting knowledge into three environments for performance support, the live, the virtual, and the constructive environments. It provides a means for the maintenance technician to gain knowledge associated with completing a given task. Seventy-eight maintenance technician trainees at an U.S. Army training center tested the framework. The hypothesis behind the proposed construct was strongly supported, thereby establishing the foundation for future work in live, virtual, and constructive environments for performance support.

T1  - Super Lean: A streamlined transactional process improvement paradigm
AN  - 305395916
AB  - This case study was conducted to determine which factors drove the success of a tailored Lean/Six Sigma approach developed by a small service organization within Lockheed Martin. Quality initiatives such as Lean and Six Sigma have been successfully deployed predominantly in large manufacturing organizations, but their translation for use in small transactional business areas has been challenging because these initiatives have not been focused on transactional processes in smaller organizations. This study examined success factors of traditional deployments and sought to determine success factors unique to small service applications.    The findings confirmed key concepts identified by other researchers in implementing Lean/Six Sigma programs of strong visible leadership, dedicated resources, employee empowerment, and alignment with business objectives. Additional findings based on the deployment in this study include the need to tailor the deployment to the culture of the organization, use service examples rather than manufacturing examples in the training, establish a strong leading coalition to facilitate the deployment across the organization, and capitalize on the agility inherent in a smaller organization to foster a culture of change.    The case study demonstrated that the concepts of Lean and Six Sigma can be successfully deployed in small service organizations to increase their potential to survive in an increasingly competitive global economy. The case study can serve as a foundation for other research to extend the use of proven traditional initiatives so they can be more universally applied.

T1  - The impact of computer-based concept mapping on nursing students' learning approach, academic self-efficacy, knowledge gains and satisfaction with learning technique
AN  - 305392375
AB  - Nurse educators are concerned with improving critical thinking in student nurses. More effective teaching techniques may be required to encourage deeper learning. The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of the computer concept mapping technique on a Smart Board (an interactive computer system), compared to the traditional PowerPoint technique. Forty-six fourth year baccalaureate-nursing students, enrolled in a critical care course, volunteered to participate in this pre/post design study and were randomly assigned to one of two seminar groups. All students completed pretest questionnaires on self-efficacy, learning approaches, a multiple choice knowledge exam on pain and stress concepts and demographic information. A two-hour seminar on pain and stress was given using traditional PowerPoint for the comparison group and computer concept mapping for the intervention group. After the seminars, students completed a satisfaction questionnaire and repeated the questionnaires on self-efficacy, learning approaches, and the pretest knowledge exam. Findings showed no significant differences between the concept mapping and traditionally taught groups. For both groups combined, self-efficacy was significantly and positively related to deep learning at posttest, (r = .54, p < .01) and reported class standing (r = .30, p < .05). Deep learning approach was positively related to reported class standing (r = .39, p < .01). Surface learning was negatively related to self-efficacy ((pretest r = -.40 p < .01) (post test r = -.45 p < .01) and deep learning (pretest r = -.30, p < .01) (post test r = -.32, p < .01). These findings suggest that students use either a deep or surface approach to learning and that self-efficacy may influence their learning approaches.

T1  - The effect of concept mapping on preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of science inquiry teaching
AN  - 305388440
AB  - This study examined the effect of concept mapping as a method of stimulating reflection on preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of science inquiry instruction methods. Three intact classes of science education preservice teachers participated in a non-randomized comparison group with a pretest and posttest design to measure the influence of mapping on participants' knowledge of inquiry science instruction. All groups followed the same course syllabus, in class activities, readings, assignments and assessment tasks. The manner in which they presented their ideas about inquiry science teaching varied. Groups constructed pre-lesson, post-lesson, and homework lists or maps across three inquiry based instruction modules (ecosystems, food chains, and electricity). Equivalent forms of the Teaching Science Inventory (TSI) were used to investigate changes in preservice teachers' propositional knowledge about how to teach using inquiry science instruction methods. Equivalent forms of the Science Lesson Planning (SLP) test were used to investigate changes in preservice teachers' application knowledge about how to teach using inquiry science instruction methods.    Data analysis included intrarater reliability, ANOVAs, ANCOVAs, and correlations between lists and maps and examination responses. SLP and TSI scores improved from the pretest to the posttest in each of the three study groups. The results indicate that, in general, there were basically no relationships between the treatment and outcome measures. In addition, there were no significant differences between the three groups in their knowledge about how to teach science. Conclusions drawn from this study include, first, the learners did learn how to teach science using inquiry. Second, in this study there is little evidence to support that concept mapping was more successful than the listing strategy in improving preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of teaching science using inquiry science instruction methods.

T1  - A comparison of inquiry-based teaching through concept maps and traditional teaching in biology
AN  - 305386834
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate affective outcomes and academic achievement for students enrolled in high school biology when instruction included concept-mapping. The research design was quasi-experimental and allowed for a comparison between an experimental group who constructed concept maps and a control group who received traditional biology instruction.    The subjects were 140 ninth-grade students, distributed into six intact biology classes, three honors and three general biology classes. Chapter tests and a textbook generated 9-week comprehensive posttest were used to measure achievement. ANCOVA analysis on the comprehensive posttest indicated no significant overall effect of concept mapping on biology achievement across the whole quarter when controlling for the quarter pretest. Chi-square analyses were performed to measure students' attitude toward biology class and activities. The experimental group indicated higher than expected tendency to be positive about the instructional methods, however, the control group indicated fewer than expected positive responses. T-tests were conducted to determine the differences between the experimental and control groups on chapter tests with or without concept mapping. The group with concept mapping scored significantly better than those with traditional methods.    Honors class comparisons indicated a significant difference between groups at p<.05 level on the chapter pretest. There was also a significant difference on the chapter test after intervention, but this time at p<.001 level. Although the general class comparisons indicated no significant difference on the chapter pretest, the experimental group scored significantly better than the control group on the chapter test following intervention. This suggests that average ability students benefit from concept mapping more than traditional instruction.    In narrative self-evaluations, only a small percentage of participants overall listed concept mapping as the review activity that helped them learn most. Recommendations for practitioners and future research were provided related to the use of concept mapping.

T1  - Narratives of adolescent students: The integration of health and learning through application of nursing theory
AN  - 305384150
AB  - Problem. There are few resources to show educators how to help students improve learning by improving health and mental well-being. There is a lack of integration in the literature in terms of how practitioners can reach these students in order to help them learn effectively and develop into successful, productive adults with meaningful lives. This study has three major sections. First, I examine my experiences within education to determine what values, truths, and principles mold my practice. Second, I identify my teaching practice in relationship to nursing theory integrating it with learning theory, thus highlighting the relationship between the health and learning of students. And third, I analyze and discuss my experiences to develop an emerging theory that can be shared with others in the fields of education and nursing.    Method. Using a narrative autobiographical approach, I reflected upon my experiences with students, evaluated comments by students, parents, colleagues, my husband, and assessed informal conversations with colleagues. I examined my teaching practice based on nursing theory as it relates to individual adolescent learners. I wrote stories using my journals. I also presented data using stories, poems, metaphor, concept maps, and graphs.    Results. After analyzing my teaching practice, three predominant themes emerged from my practice as a nurse---caring, compassion, and student advocacy---that are applicable to the practice of teaching and connect the relationship between the health and learning experience of students. Caring provides opportunities for role modeling, dialoguing, reflection, connection, and community. Compassion requires recognition of self-involvement with students and the knowledge of the nature of life itself with all its twists and turns in order to deal with student suffering. Student advocacy requires entering into supporting, trusting, and flexible relationships with students. Together these three themes demonstrate my practice and lead to my emerging theory of Teacher Becoming.    Conclusions. Since my practice is based on my emerging Theory of Teacher Becoming, I am challenged to connect the relationship of health and well-being with learning effectiveness of adolescent students and to emphasize the human perspective. Therefore, this bridges the lack of integration between health and learning so that educators can have the benefit of my nursing practice in teaching as a result of this research study. As I progress and cultivate my practice, the Theory of Teacher Becoming will be continually tested and continue to evolve.

T1  - The effect of concept mapping on critical thinking skills of baccalaureate nursing students
AN  - 305367586
AB  - National nursing accrediting bodies view critical thinking skills as an expected competency of graduating students; the challenge facing faculty is how to promote these skills prior to entry into practice. Current nursing literature recommends the concept map as a strategy for nursing curricula to facilitate the development of critical thinking skills. This study examined the effects of concept mapping on critical thinking skills of 29 baccalaureate nursing students. The experimental group employed concept maps for weekly clinical assignments, while the control group used traditional care plans. Critical thinking skills were evaluated using the Critical Thinking Indicators™ tool at the beginning and end of the clinical rotation. Results were compared using the Wilcoxon test to evaluate the impact of concept mapping on critical thinking skills. There was a substantial statistically significant difference in the experimental group, suggesting that concept maps are an effective way to improve critical thinking skills.

T1  - Learning of quantitative research methods: University students' views, motivation and difficulties in learning
AN  - 305359580
AB  - The aim of this dissertation was to study the difficulties that some students of education, psychology and social science experience in their quantitative research courses at university. The problem is approached from the perspectives of anxiety studies, studies on conceptions and beliefs, orientations in learning situations and theories of conceptual change.    In Study I, it was found that research, especially quantitative methods and statistics, appeared to be more difficult for education and sociology students to learn than other academic subjects, for example their major subject studies and language studies. In Case Study II, it was found that anxious students' concept map of research, drawn in an interview situation, was more fragmented than the concept maps of less anxious students and experts. Study III revealed that the high school mathematics grade was only partly associated with difficulties experienced. A belief in one's low ability in mathematical subjects was connected to other difficulties experienced in the learning of research. In Study IV, different views on research methods were found in Finland and USA with regard to students' appreciation of quantitative, qualitative, empirical and theoretical methods. In both countries, a negative research orientation toward quantitative methods was found which was associated with a positive view on qualitative methods. In study V, it was found that in both Finland and the U.S.A., the students who were not convinced that they would need research skills in their future work, were less task- and deep-oriented in their study situations, and experienced more problems with learning than the students who agreed that they would need research skills.    Together, these five studies showed that students' difficulties experienced in quantitative methods courses, research orientations and motivational factors, do constitute an interconnected web that may also have implications for content learning and to students' views of the importance of research skills for their future work.

T1  - Interactive animated concept map generation: Using dynamic animations
AN  - 305344258
AB  - We present visualization too, which is useful for the illustration of educational concepts using interactive animated concept maps. This System serves as a presentation tool which provides a collection of multimedia elements (images, animations, audios clips and video clips), a collection of animated presentation templates and an interface by using which users can retrieve the multimedia elements from the multimedia database and generate the dynamic animations by placing the selected elements into the placeholders in the templates. This system generates the animated presentation by replacing embedded multimedia objects and their properties as desired by its users. Content objects are obtained from a multimedia database that is populated by a web search agent which conducts concept based searches. A domain knowledge base provides the base queries for automatic search initiation.

T1  - Concept matching in informal node -link knowledge representations
AN  - 305024274
AB  - Information stored by managed organizations in free text documents, databases, and engineered knowledge repositories can often be processed as networks of conceptual nodes and relational links (concept graphs). However, these models tend to be informal as related to new or multi-source tasks. This work contributes to the understanding of techniques for matching knowledge elements: in informal node-link knowledge representations, drawn from existing data resources, to support user-guided analysis. Its guiding focus is the creation of tools that compare, retrieve, and merge existing information resources.
Three essays explore important algorithmic and heuristic elements needed to leverage concept graphs in real-world applications. Section 2 documents an algorithm which identifies likely matches between student and instructor concept maps aiming to support semi-automatic matching and scoring for both classroom and unsupervised environments. The knowledge-anchoring, similarity flooding algorithm significantly improves on term-based matching by leveraging map structure and also has potential as a methodology for combining other informal, human-created knowledge representations. Section 3 describes a decompositional tagging approach to organizing (aggregating) automatically extracted biomedical pathway relations. We propose a five-level aggregation strategy for extracted relations and measure the effectiveness of the BioAggregate tagger in preparing extracted information for analysis and visualization. Section 4 evaluates an importance flooding algorithm designed to assist law enforcement investigators in identifying useful investigational leads. While association networks have a long history as an investigational tool, more systematic processes are needed to guide development of high volume cross jurisdictional data sharing initiatives. We test path-based selection heuristics and importance flooding to improve on traditional association-closeness methodologies.
Together, these essays demonstrate how structural and semantic information can be processed in parallel to effectively leverage ambiguous network representations of data. Also, they show that real applications can be addressed by processing available data using an informal concept graph paradigm. This approach and these techniques are potentially useful for workflow systems, business intelligence analysis, and other knowledge management applications where information can be represented in an informal conceptual network and that information needs to be analyzed and converted into actionable, communicable human knowledge.

T1  - The efficacy of personal knowledge bases for materializing mental impressions
AN  - 305005949
AB  - Software tools abound for managing documents and other information sources, but are rarely used to store the mental knowledge readers glean from reading them. Hence our conceptual understanding - perhaps our most precious commodity in the so-called "information age" - is normally left subject to the whims of our erratic memories.    This thesis explores the concept of a personal knowledge base : an experimental database and interface designed to store and retrieve a user's accumulated personal knowledge. It aims to let the user represent information in a way that corresponds more naturally to their mental conceptions than textual notes would. People naturally form mental models of the domains they explore and learn about, and a personal knowledge base allows these to be expressed and archived directly. They need not be converted first to text, a representation which is actually alien to much of the human thought process. A personal knowledge base reflects a user's own subjective understanding of their world, permitting alternate views of the same objective data. And just as each person has many ideas from different domains tied together through perceived associations, it supports an integrated web of knowledge, potentially mirroring the entire contents of its owner's mind.    After defining the notion of a personal knowledge base precisely, and outlining its role in a user's life and expected benefits, this thesis provides the design rationale for a prototype application. It then presents the results of deploying it to twenty volunteers who used it in real-world settings for extended periods of time. The results suggest that such a tool can be a tremendous asset for a variety of knowledge-related tasks, although commitment, discipline, and a willingness to alter one's habits are prerequisites for maximum success. It also sheds some light on the ways people typically work with knowledge, and suggests that unless these patterns are changed, they may ultimately form limitations on the effectiveness of such a tool, and indeed on our use of knowledge in general.

T1  - Applying communication theory to design, location and evaluation of interpretive signs
AN  - 305003265
AB  - Despite widespread use of interpretive signs to communicate with the public, it is not clear when and where such signage is effective. Research indicates that proximity of labels to the object of interpretation increases effectiveness, but the reasons are unclear. Several theories may clarify these findings. Semantic association and referential connections, constructs in Dual Coding Theory, may explain increased recognition knowledge and elaboration due to proximal location of a label. Personal usefulness/relevance of information, a construct in the Elaboration Likelihood Model of Persuasion, may also explain increased elaboration. Personal cost-benefit assessment of information value, a construct in the Adaptive Control of Thoughts in Information Foraging Model, may explain increased holding time.    Visitors to Timothy Lake in Oregon were surveyed following exposure to one of six different interpretive signs. Study 1 evaluated the effect of relatedness, defined as high semantic association between information on the sign and the surrounding features, and found it had a significant effect on holding time and recognition knowledge. However, it did not significantly affect elaboration. Study 2 evaluated the effect of facilitating referential connections between verbal information (sign) and visual information (environment), and found it had, in combination with relatedness, a significant effect on elaboration. However, it did not significantly affect recognition knowledge. Overall results indicate that applying communication theory to developing and locating interpretive signs can lead to increased elaboration and recognition knowledge.    Amount of elaboration is considered an appropriate measure of effectiveness because it is often associated with knowledge retention and attitude and behavior change. Our understanding of the quality of data gathered from different tools for assessing elaboration in a field study is limited. Participants in Study 3 reported thoughts following exposure to a communication stimulus through thought listing, interview, or a concept map prepared with minimal instruction. Results indicate that concept maps may be a useful tool for measuring elaboration in a field setting, especially for assessing amount of elaboration and organization of knowledge. Interviews may be superior in gathering data about specific cognitive, affective and behavioral impacts of the information on the participant.

T1  - Using the Biodatamation™ strategy to learn introductory college biology: Value-added effects on selected students' conceptual understanding and conceptual integration of the processes of photosynthesis and cellular respiration
AN  - 304989593
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory research was to study how students learn photosynthesis and cellular respiration and to determine the value added to the student's learning by each of the three technology-scaffolded learning strategy components (animated concept presentations and WebQuest-style activities, data collection, and student-constructed animations) of the BioDatamation™ (BDM) Program. BDM learning strategies utilized the Theory of Interacting Visual Fields™ (TIVF) (Reuter & Wandersee, 2002a, 2002b; 2003a, 2003b) which holds that meaningful knowledge is hierarchically constructed using the past, present, and future visual fields, with visual metacognitive components that are derived from the principles of Visual Behavior (Jones, 1995), Human Constructivist Theory (Mintzes & Wandersee, 1998a), and Visual Information Design Theory (Tufte, 1990, 1997, 2001). Student alternative conceptions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration were determined by the item analysis of 263,267 Biology Advanced Placement Examinations and were used to develop the BDM instructional strategy and interview questions. The subjects were 24 undergraduate students of high and low biology prior knowledge enrolled in an introductory-level General Biology course at a major research university in the Deep South. Fifteen participants received BDM instruction which included original and innovative learning materials and laboratories in 6 phases; 8 of the 15 participants were the subject of in depth, extended individual analysis. The other 9 participants received traditional, non-BDM instruction. Interviews which included participants’ creation of concept maps and visual field diagrams were conducted after each phase. Various content analyses, including Chi's Verbal Analysis and quantitizing/qualitizing were used for data analysis. The total value added to integrative knowledge during BDM instruction with the three visual fields was an average increase of 56% for cellular respiration and 62% increase for photosynthesis knowledge, improved long-term memory of concepts, and enhanced biological literacy to the multidimensional level, as determined by the BSCS literacy model. WebQuest-style activities and data collection provided for animated prior knowledge in the past visual field, and detailed content knowledge construction in the present visual field. During student construction of animated presentations, layering required participants to think by rearranging words and images for improved hierarchical organization of knowledge with real-life applications.

T1  - Virtual reality in the K–12 classroom
AN  - 304989505
AB  - This dissertation explores the effectiveness of VR as an instructional tool in formal educational settings. Three manuscripts each deal with a different aspect of integrating virtual reality into a middle/high school classroom.    Although, there are no plug-and-play virtual reality solutions currently available to the K-12 teacher, there are easy ways to teach concepts related to VR. The first article discusses the hardware, software, resources and concepts needed to integrate Desktop VR into the technology classroom with a minimal investment of resources.    The second article reports results from a study comparing traditional, model and virtual reality teaching environments. These environments teach concepts regarding simple machines to volunteers from an eighth-grade science class. Nonparametric tests showed a statistically significant concept gain, as measured by scores from concept maps, for students in the model and VR environments.    Cognitive theories of Multimedia Learning, Dual-Coding Theory and Levels of Processing Theory in graphic, model and VR environments are explored in the third article. Students in all three environments showed significant gains from pretest to post-test supporting dual-coding theory and levels of processing theory. Lower test scores for students in the graphics group can be accounted for by the amount of skill needed to mentally construct three-dimensional images from two-dimensional graphics.

T1  - The relationship between beginning teachers' prior conceptions of geography, knowledge and pedagogy and their development
AN  - 301639350
AB  - This research examines the relationship between primary postgraduate (PGCE) students’ conceptions of geography, knowledge and pedagogy and their development as teachers of primary geography over two years – the primary PGCE course and the first year of teaching. The methodology is essentially qualitative and based on the principles of grounded theory. Personal Construct Theory (PCT) has also informed the choice of research techniques, PCT being seen to be appropriate for a research project that aims to access and therefore examine a range of alternative constructions. Concept mapping was used at the beginning and end of the geography component of a PGCE Primary course to elicit all students’ conceptions of geography, teaching and learning. Analysis of the concept maps from the whole cohort (n=79) show that primary students’ conceptions of geography are generally rather simplistic and reflective of the descriptive-rich and scientific persuasions identified by Barratt Hacking (1996). Only a few students’ maps reflected environmental or humanistic/welfare persuasions. The concepts maps were also sorted into four categories from most sophisticated to least sophisticated conceptions of geography. It was noted that of the eight students in category one (most sophisticated) only one had a geography degree. A sample of 11 students was then interviewed (using a stimulated recall technique (Calderhead 1986)) about their conceptions using the elicitation data as a stimulus for the discussion. This enabled the researcher to both probe students’ conceptions in greater depth, and to validate initial analysis of the elicitation data. Finally, three students – one a geographer (with a geography degree) and the others non-geographers – were observed teaching geography and interviewed directly after the observations on three occasions over the two years. A coding system was developed from all the data, and was then used to analyse the interviews using Microsoft Word index and cross-referencing functions. These analyses, along with elicitation data, formed the basis of case studies of the development of three students as geography teachers over two years. A model for beginning teacher development in the field of primary geography is then proposed.  The model emerged from interpreting and synthesising the evidence from the three case studies, and through the use of the constant comparison technique (Strauss & Corbin, 1998). The model is applied to the series of lessons observed for each case study providing an overview of their development as teachers of primary geography. Comparison of the three cases over two years shows some startling similarities as well as some differences in their development. It seems that each of them, whether they held a geography degree or not, discounted the geographical knowledge they have gained from life experiences as a valuable base to work from, despite the relevance of this knowledge to their teaching. It also seems that each of them, when observed during their PGCE course, were most likely to draw on their memory of geography lessons from when they were a pupil as a model to inform their teaching. As the two years progressed, and their pedagogical knowledge developed, they began to replace these early experiences with ones more suited to effective teaching – that is, their more recent experiences as teachers.  Of the three beginning teachers, only David, who had a geography degree, developed to become an effective geography teacher during the research period. However, it is considered that, for the majority of primary teachers, the most that can be expected is that they will develop into effective teachers of primary geography because it is unlikely that they would have opportunities to develop the depth of subject knowledge required to be an effective geography teacher. The thesis concludes by offering some thoughts for the development of primary geographical education. It proposes that primary geography could be usefully conceptualised as ‘everyday’, or ‘ethno-‘geography, that is a geography that recognises and seeks to address the ‘false split between practical, everyday knowledge and abstract, theoretical knowledge’ (Frankenstein & Powell, 1994). This is a geography that explicitly values the geographical knowledge that we all build up from everyday experiences in the world and that, in conjunction with the development of a geographical imagination, might form the basis of a primary geography framework.

T1  - Using the BioDatamation Strategy to Learn Introductory College Biology: Value-Added Effects on Selected Students' Conceptual Understanding and Conceptual Integration of the Processes of Photosynthesis and Celluar Respiration
AN  - 2675219580
AB  - The purpose of this exploratory research was to study how students learn photosynthesis and cellular respiration and to determine the value added to the student's learning by each of the three technology-scaffolded learning strategy components (animated concept presentations and WebQuest-style activities, data collection, and student-constructed animations) of the BioDatamation™ (BDM) Program. BDM learning strategies utilized the Theory of Interacting Visual Fields™ (TIVF) (Reuter&Wandersee, 2002a, 2002b; 2003a, 2003b) which holds that meaningful knowledge is hierarchically constructed using the past, present, and future visual fields, with visual metacognitive components that are derived from the principles of Visual Behavior (Jones,1995), Human Constructivist Theory (Mintzes&Wandersee, 1998a), and Visual Information Design Theory (Tufte, 1990, 1997, 2001). Student alternative conceptions of photosynthesis and cellular respiration were determined by the item analysis of 263,267 Biology Advanced Placement Examinations and were used to develop the BDM instructional strategy and interview questions. The subjects were 24 undergraduate students of high and low biology prior knowledge enrolled in an introductory-level General Biology course at a major research university in the Deep South. Fifteen participants received BDM instruction which included original and innovative learning materials and laboratories in 6 phases; 8 of the 15 participants were the subject of in depth, extended individual analysis. The other 9 participants received traditional, non-BDM instruction. Interviews which included participants’ creation of concept maps and visual field diagrams were conducted after each phase. Various content analyses, including Chi's Verbal Analysis and quantitizing/qualitizing were used for data analysis. The total value added to integrative knowledge during BDM instruction with the three visual fields was an average increase of 56% for cellular respiration and 62% increase for photosynthesis knowledge, improved long-term memory of concepts, and enhanced biological literacy to the multidimensional level, as determined by the BSCS literacy model. WebQuest-style activities and data collection provided for animated prior knowledge in the past visual field, and detailed content knowledge construction in the present visual field. During student construction of animated presentations, layering required participants to think by rearranging words and images for improved hierarchical organization of knowledge with real-life applications.

T1  - Virtual alchemies: can new learning technologies transform police training?
AN  - 1793945196
AB  - This was a collaborative action research project with three, mixed method evaluation cycles. Its aim was to increase the impact of new learning technologies (NLT) in two Police Forces. The first reconnaissance cycle found a significant absence of uptake for one computer based training system (<1% impact after five years) with only assumptions of ‘technological determinism’ driving the process. A range of individual, work related and cultural factors were illuminated, towards understanding how the Force might become a ‘network’ organisation, where technology fundamentally transforms how work is done (Symon, 2000). Following the qualitative interview study, a quantitative survey was carried out with 164 respondents on the areas of concern for NLT in the Police. Factor analysis of this data reinforced a parsimonious five factor solution, accounting for 55% of the variance and on which to proceed with cycles two and three. In the second cycle, 130 Police Probationers completed a battery of psychometrics to assess individual difference factors associated with successful outcomes in training with NLT. Results showed 27% of the variance on a bespoke NLT learning measure was predicted by computer attitudes. Age, gender, education, motivational and almost all personality measures offered no significant contribution to explaining the data. The bespoke learning criterion was used as a pre-test, post-test and retention measure and showed significant increases in knowledge were gained from NLT: effective and efficient learning was evidenced. Also in the second cycle, a sub-sample of (n=20-34) Probationers participated in two stages of repertory grid interviews rating different elements of Police training methods. From these data an ‘Ideal Probationer Learning Event’ (IPLE) model was proposed. This was stable over time and positioned NLT within a conceptual structure that identified preferred and non-preferred construct poles equating to four dimensions along which Police officers reliably rated any training event. In essence, it highlighted sites of perceived credibility and offered these as levers for creative change. Follow-up work with 120 Probationers using another example of NLT explored how integration of learning from NLT could occur from a learner-centered point of view, using an interpretive concept mapping technique. This illuminated sites of power exchange and the location of ‘ownership’ of learning in Police culture. The IPLE model was used to direct the third cycle which included constructivist and contingency perspectives. It was propsed that by creatively designing an NLT event to increase elements of the preferred constructs discovered in cycle two, integration of an NLT event would enable the transformative properties of NLT as a to manifest themselves. A sample of up to 60 Police Staff used an NLT package alongside a bespoke, collaborative e-learning group. Criterions were developed according to skill breadth, frequency and difficulty and significant increases in learning were not only found, but maintained following completion of NLT when retention was measured. The e-learning group brought some of the credible elements of training to the NLT event, thereby constituting a ‘unique solution’ (Seltzer, 1971). It created peer learning groups, despite geographical separation. Data for each level of Kirkpatrick’s (1959; 1960) ‘best practice’ training evaluation model was collected enabling the conclusion that creative integration is key to a network uptake of NLT.

T1  - On the role of concept mapping assessments in today's constructivist classroom
AN  - 1506562918
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the use of concept map assessments in freshman level general chemistry courses. Two strategies were employed in this study. The first strategy involved the creation of a web based concept mapping program capable of scoring concept maps drawn by students. The second strategy involved comparing different methods of scoring concept maps.   Students enrolled in web based general chemistry course drew concept maps using the web based Concept Map Assessment Tool, CMAT. The reliability of the automated scoring in the CMAT program was tested by scoring the concept maps created in the CMAT program by hand.  The results of the study indicated that scoring concept maps by hand was the same as the automated scoring of concept maps in the CMAT program.   Two characteristics of concept maps serve as the basis for scoring methods. The relational character of a concept map is defined as the correctness of the propositions in the concept map. The structural character of a concept map is defined as the key features of the map, such as branches, long chains or intersecting points. The scoring method used in the CMAT program scores the relational aspects of a concept map. In this study, a second relational scoring method was used to score the concept maps drawn by students using the CMAT program, and the two sets of scores were compared. A novel structural scoring method, the Structural Complexity Index (SCI), was developed compared to the relational scoring approach of the CMAT program. The results of this study found the two relational scoring methods to score concept maps similarly under certain conditions. The SCI was found to produce a different score for concept maps than the relational scoring method employed by CMAT.

T1  - Student campaign against HIV /AIDS in Ghana: A Participatory Action Research (PAR) initiative
AN  - 305213565
AB  - Adults and formal institutions have not tapped adequately into the creativity and organizational skills of youth in Ghana. Conventional channels of communication are not reaching the youth effectively, in part because the advice of elders is not much heeded in the area of sexual behavior or any other area in an era where “youth culture” reigns. Young people tend to think that they are immortal. There is a strong contention between condom use proponents and religious institutions.    This study was part of an initiative in which young people in Ghana, mostly students at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology in Kumasi, campaigned against HIV/AIDS using Participatory Action Research (PAR) from January 2002 through December 2002.    Participants in this action research sought to understand the dynamics of issues and barriers that they, young people, considered key to addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Ghana. They introduced processes of behavioral social change to empower themselves and each other, to reduce the rate of HIV/AIDS infection and to manage already existing HIV/AIDS cases in Ghana. During each process, they also aimed at understanding the dynamics of using PAR to address HIV/AIDS in Ghana.    Concept Mapping was used to organize and analyze data on how participants in the initiative felt HIV/AIDS needed to be addressed in Ghana. Participants concluded on three issue-partitioned areas as key to addressing HIV/AIDS in Ghana: (1) programming issues, (2) technical issues and (3) cultural issues. Specifically, participants concluded that for HIV/AIDS intervention initiatives to be successful, young people need to be adequately involved from the conception stage, and programs should be planned together with the various religious institutions in the country to develop messages and approaches that would be cultural specific. Once messages are internalized and included in societal norms, programs would have higher chances of success.    In addition the issues mentioned above, participants noted some key barriers to combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Ghana: ageism, bad role models, homelessness, human rights violation, ignorance, lack of self-control, media, “not me” syndrome, poverty, sex—a high emotional item, stigma and youth culture.    The use of PAR in this initiative helped participants to empower themselves and each other cognitively, methodologically, politically, emotionally and interpersonally, using ideas, ideals and friendship, and other participatory techniques. However, a better mix of youth and adult in collaborative inquiry and action is recommended for similar future research.    It is recommended by this research that policies on HIV/AIDS programming be targeted at ensuring that programs work at introducing processing that would encourage target groups to individually internalize messages and processes, and hopefully translate them into societal norms.

T1  - Technology adoption in higher education: A framework for identifying and prioritizing issues and barriers to adoption
AN  - 305212098
AB  - This research examined the issues and barriers that inhibit faculty from using technology in instruction. The research proposes a framework that combines the empirical data from concept mapping with the theoretical factors identified from the literature to create a process that identifies the priority issues and barriers to technology adoption. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis was used to analyze the data gathered from the brainstorming session. A barrier definition and classification scheme was created and used to connect issues to barriers of adoption. Descriptive mixed methods approach was used to develop a pictorial multivariate conceptual framework for understanding the relationships and inter-relationships between issues and barriers to technology.    Fifty-five faculty, nine key administrators and staff participated in a study to identify issues to the use of web-based technology in instruction at their instruction, University of Minnesota at Moorhead. The stakeholders identified and rated 99 issues to web-based technology in instruction. The issues were grouped into 11 issue clusters. The study identified Moorhead State University as Early Adopts of web-based technology in instruction. The two clusters of issues with the highest avenge rating of importance were: (1) Leadership and Support (4.01/5.0); (2) Faculty Issues (3.49/5.0).    Overall, the results of the study indicate that the stakeholders' perceived lack of Leadership and Support for the technology, and the lack of Knowledge/Information about the technology to be the driving forces inhibiting faculty use of Web based technology in instruction. Specifically some of the issues are: (1) Technology must be easy to use. (2) Faculty needs time to learn how to use technology. (3) Technology needs to be supported to use in the classroom.    Recommendations for overcoming issues and barriers to adopting technology in instruction are provided for institutions that are similarly in the early phases of adopting technology in instruction on their campus.

AN  - 305210193
AB  - The primary focus of this study examines students' conceptions of the brain and learning, while a secondary focus examines the development of students' conceptions during an introductory brain course. This quasi-experimental study is conducted with five experimental brain course participants and two control group participants. Pooled interview and concept map data undergo phenomenographic analysis resulting in a summative “model of students' conceptions of the brain and learning”. The model presents three key conceptual categories each representing an aspect of learning: structural, functional, and conditional aspect. Generally, students' possess what appears to be an intuitive understanding of what learning is, how they experience learning, and what conditions in the learning environment support their learning.    Comparative analysis of experimental and control group data, as well as of pre- and post-course concept maps did not find evidence of conceptual change on the part of student participants. Therefore, this study speculates that explicit instruction during a brain course did not appear to influence students' intuitive models. This concurs with a lack of empirical evidence also reported by previous studies examining conceptual change.

T1  - Effective science teachers: Their content knowledge
AN  - 305205557
AB  - Subject matter and pedagogy have been components of teacher education since its origin, and research shows that they will continue to be debated in research and policy circles (Sosniak, 1999). Both components of teacher education are necessary, and research exists in both areas; however, explicit research about the content knowledge involved in effective teaching is lacking. This study focuses on the content knowledge of effective secondary science teachers and the role their content knowledge plays in planning and instruction. Case studies were developed for National Board Certified chemistry teachers. Data collected included classroom observations, interviews, concept maps, and classroom materials. The data were analyzed using the theoretical frameworks of Wertsch (1998), Shulman (1987), and Applebee (1996), and five themes were revealed. First, the teachers had various depths of content knowledge. Second, all of the teachers had experience working in a scientific laboratory; they had experience “doing” science. Third, each of the teachers planned with the goals of their students in mind. Fourth, all of the teachers were able to relate chemistry to the lives of their students. And finally, each of the teachers cited the context of his or her situation as being integral in decision making regarding planning and instruction. These findings were compared with literature in science teacher education to extend the possible implications. The themes have implications for teacher education programs, including the importance of (1) student knowledge, (2) discussing content in relationship to teaching, (3) scientific laboratory research, and (4) determining good and bad instructional representations.

T1  - Intelligent support for knowledge capture and construction
AN  - 305204819
AB  - In traditional views of knowledge management, knowledge capture is seen as primarily knowledge acquisition, capturing knowledge that already exists within the expert. This thesis proposes an alternative approach, “knowledge extension,” based on the premise that a knowledge model evolves from coordinated processes of knowledge acquisition and knowledge construction. In this view, it is crucial to support experts' construction of new knowledge as they extend existing knowledge models. This dissertation develops and evaluates artificial intelligence methods to facilitate knowledge extension, especially in the context of knowledge modeling via concept mapping. The problem of supporting knowledge extension raises two research questions: First, how can topic descriptors be algorithmically extracted from concept maps, and second, how to use these topic descriptors to identify candidate topics on the Web with the right balance of novelty and relevance. To address these questions, this thesis develops the theoretical framework required for a “topic suggester'” to aid information search in the context of a knowledge model under construction. Finally, it describes and evaluates EXTENDER, an implemented support tool based on this framework. The proposed algorithms have been developed and tested within the framework of CmapTools, a widely-used system for supporting knowledge modeling using concept maps. However, their generality makes them applicable to a broad class of knowledge modeling systems, and to Web search in general.

T1  - The associations of autonomy support and conceptual press with engaged reading and conceptual learning from text
AN  - 305173247
AB  - This study examined the associations of autonomy support and conceptual press, with reading engagement and conceptual learning from text. When students perceive their teacher to be supporting autonomy, it means that student choice, ownership, and personal goals are emphasized. When students perceive their teacher to be supporting conceptual press, it means that the teacher (a) promotes understanding of the substantial principles of a domain; (b) helps students use information integration strategies during reading, such as concept mapping, and (c) promotes persistence on moderately challenging tasks. Based on the self-process model of motivation (Connell & Wellborn, 1990) and an engagement perspective of reading (Baker, Dreher & Guthrie, 2000), it was hypothesized that as students perceived their instruction to be motivating, their reading engagement would increase. In turn, as engaged reading increases, conceptual learning from text would increase. For this investigation, 244 fourth- and fifth-grade students reported their perceptions of their teachers' use of conceptual press and autonomy support in reading instruction. Multifaceted components of reading engagement were measured. Reading engagement was defined as the manifestations of affective, behavioral, and cognitive processes during reading. In addition, participants completed a reading performance assessment in the domain of science designed to measure prior knowledge, strategic reading, and conceptual learning from text. Structural equation modeling was used to compare alternative theoretical models depicting the relations among motivated reading instruction, engaged reading, and conceptual learning from text. The direct effects model had a direct path connecting motivating reading instruction with conceptual learning from text whereas the hypothesized indirect effects model contained an indirect path from motivating reading instruction to conceptual learning from text via engaged reading. Results confirmed the hypothesis that the model including an indirect effect of motivating reading instruction on conceptual learning from text through engaged reading explained the data more fully than a direct effect model. This is consistent with the self-process model of motivation (Connell & Wellborn, 1990). These results have implications for theories of the role of social contexts in engagement and achievement, particularly in the domain of reading, and also suggest ways by which teachers might foster reading engagement among students.

T1  - An explanatory model of physics faculty conceptions about the problem -solving process
AN  - 305158638
AB  - One commonly stated instructor goal for an introductory calculus-based physics course is to improve students' problem-solving skills. There is, however, a growing body of research evidence to suggest that this goal is not frequently accomplished in a typical college or university physics course. In response to this evidence, researchers and curriculum developers have developed a wide variety of curricular materials and instructional strategies that have been shown to be more effective in improving student problem solving performance. In spite of the availability of these materials and strategies, relatively few physics instructors have chosen to use them. One likely reason is that these materials and strategies are not consistent with the ways that physics instructors think about the teaching and learning of problem solving. This has led the Physics Education Research Group at the University of Minnesota to undertake a multistage research program to understand physics instructors' conceptions about the teaching and learning of problem solving.    In the first stage, semi-structured interviews with higher education physics instructors in Minnesota were conducted. Based on an in-depth analysis of interview transcripts with six research university physics instructors, an initial explanatory model was developed that described the range and nature of conceptions for these instructors. Part of this initial model identified these instructors' conceptions of the problem-solving process. Around the same time, interviews were also conducted with 24 additional instructors from other types of higher education institutions in Minnesota.    The current study is the second stage of that research program. The goal of this study is to modify and refine the part of the initial explanatory model dealing with instructor conceptions about the problem-solving process using the 24 additional interviews. With the expanded sample, this current study seeks to converge on a more viable explanatory model of physics instructors' conceptions about the problem-solving process. The refined explanatory model developed in this study consisted of two qualitatively different conceptions of the problem-solving process. These two conceptions differed in the underlying nature of what problem solving entails, and also differed in their descriptions of the thinking processes that underlie successful problem solving.

T1  - The use of various techniques to teach weathering and erosion
AN  - 305157986
AB  - During the 2003–2004 school years, earth science students at Charlotte High School completed a unit on weathering and erosion. The unit was developed to address common issues facing educators. The first issue was the need to align instruction with state and national science standards related to earth science. Secondly, was the need to incorporate a variety of effective teaching strategies into classroom instruction that address a range of learners in a classroom. The following techniques were incorporated within the teaching materials: concept maps, PowerPoint presentations, pictures, student drawings, application projects that allow students options, anticipatory sets and writing. Data were collected using predetermined pretest and post-test questions to measure the effectiveness of the various teaching techniques used. Participants also completed a student survey to reflect on the techniques used throughout the unit.    The data showed considerable improvement by the students in all areas. Student survey results expressed particular value to the use of pictures and drawings as well as concept maps.

T1  - New approaches to teaching high school ecology
AN  - 305155467
AB  - The purpose of this study was to increase the active learning involved in a high school ecology unit taught to mostly freshmen and sophomores in an integrated science course. By increasing the active learning, student comprehension, enthusiasm, and awareness about ecology and the environment should also be facilitated. Students were exposed to various hands-on learning activities including inquiry-based activities, concept maps, posters, and other cooperative group activities. A significant activity designed to encompass the entire unit was the Pond Jar Ecosystem. Students were asked to model the scientific method through the use of water quality testing and learn other ecology concepts through the study of the pond ecosystems. The class is part of the students' science graduation requirements. A pretest consisting of mostly objective questions was administered prior to teaching the unit. The test assessed a variety of basic ecology concepts in an essay format. A posttest was also administered at the end of the unit, consisting of the same pretest questions in an essay format with additional questions included to provide a formal, in-class grade. A paired t-test calculation between the scores of the pretest and posttest indicated a significant difference. With thirty-two degrees of freedom, the t-value was 8.40 with a standard error of difference of 1.122 and the confidence interval was 95%. The goal of facilitation of ecology comprehension was met and future revisions will address guiding principles not tested.

T1  - The effect of using the history of science in science lessons on meaningful learning
AN  - 305141167
AB  - This dissertation presents a four-month study which investigated the effectiveness of curriculum materials incorporating the history of science on learning science, understanding the nature of science, and students' interest in science. With regards to these objectives, three different class contexts were developed three main types of historical information: history of scientific concepts, the nature of science, and stories from scientists' personal lives. In the first class context, which is termed the “Meaningful Class”, the similarities between students' alternative ideas and scientific concepts from the history of science were considered in developing teaching materials. In the second context, which is termed the “Nature of Science (NOS) Class”, the teacher developed discussion sessions on the ways scientists produce scientific knowledge. In the third class context, which is termed the “Interest Class”, short stories about scientists' personal lives were used without connection to the concepts of science or nature of science.    Ninety-four eighth-grade students were randomly assigned to four classes taught by the same science teacher. The concepts in the motion unit and in the force unit were taught. The curriculum of the school district was followed in the development of the three class contexts. Three of the four classrooms were taught using the contexts provided by the history of science while the fourth class was taught in the same way that the teacher had used in previous years.    The effects on student learning of science, understanding the nature of science, and interest in science were evaluated at the beginning, at the middle, and at the end of the study to compare differences between historical class contexts and the Traditional Class. Three separate instruments were administered, class sessions were videotaped, and semi-structured interviews were audio taped.    Student learning was measured using concept mapping before and after the motion and force units. Results of analysis showed that for each class independent of each other, student Meaningful Learning for both the motion and force units increased significantly from pretest to posttest. However, the results of statistical analysis showed that the differences between classes were not significant for either the motion or force unit.    Students' views of the nature of science were measured by using Perspectives on Scientific Epistemology (POSE) instrument. The percentage of Naive and Informed views of students was observed for the following aspects of the nature of science: Scientific Method, Tentativeness, Inference, and Subjectivity. The history of science affected student perceptions of scientific process and role of Inference in the process of science.    The Interest Survey measured components of interest: Individual Interest, Situational Interest, Involvement Component of Interest, Meaningful Component of Interest, and Story Component of Interest. The effect of the different types of historical information on the levels of student interest was analyzed. Results of the study showed that stories from scientists' personal lives stimulated the Story Component of Interest, while discussions of scientific methods without these stories decreased student interest. The positive effects of stories relating scientist' personal life on student interest in science has major importance for the teaching of science. This research also helps to clarify the different class contexts which can be provided with different types and uses of historical information. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - What's gender got to do with it? A ten -year retrospective case study of a Management Development for Women Program
AN  - 305132296
AB  - This 10-year retrospective case study of a Management Development for Women Program uses a theory-driven mixed method holistic design and is jointly sponsored by St. Mary's University and Mt. St. Vincent University in Halifax, N.S. Subjects are the graduates of the MDW Program from 1990 to 2001 (N = 137), divided into three chronological groups based on period of enrolment, (1990–93, 1994–97, and 1998–00). The overall findings of this study indicate that women managers still face unique problems relating to gender in both organizational and educational institutions. The results suggest three distinct factors contributed to the success of the MDW program. First, the formal program content increased the participants' profile in their organization, and increased their effectiveness and self-confidence. Second, the culture and unexpected learning, and third, the single-gender feature. For the most part the results validated the conceptual framework under which the program has operated. The findings of the study show that there are still double standards for promotion, which are gender-based, and there are still issues relating specifically to women in management. Therefore, single gender management development programs, which are designed to address these issues, are still needed.

T1  - Stress and coping strategies in runaway youths: An application of concept mapping
AN  - 305127911
AB  - The number of runaway adolescents has continued to increase in recent years. Despite the growth and the pervasive problems of high levels of stress and low levels of positive coping strategies to deal with this stress, scant research has been devoted to the stress and coping problems of this population. This study is the first of its kind to explore stress and coping strategies of runaway youths.    Participants were male and female runaway adolescents (n = 53) living in a runaway shelter in Austin, Texas. Concept Mapping, a mixed-method approach developed by Trochim (1989), was used to collect, organize and interpret qualitative data through quantitative techniques. The present study used Concept Mapping to define concepts of stressors and coping strategies, and to detect domains of stressors and coping.    Concept Mapping revealed six major clusters of stressors: Disrespect, Living Stability, Anxiety, School, Friends, and Family. Five major coping strategies emerged as well: Relaxation, Social Support, Going Out, Hobbies/Interests, and Escaping.    A Pearson's r was extracted to assess the strength of the relationship (the level of consistency) between groups such as male versus female, White versus Non-White, and situational runaways versus chronic runaways. Great levels of disagreement in stressor identification were observed between White versus Non-White (r = .64). Non-White youths experienced higher levels of stress from problems related to school, friends, and disrespect than did White youths. Similarly, high levels of disagreement in coping strategies were observed across different ethnic groups (r = .73). Non-White youths reported greater frequency of using coping methods of Social Support and Going Out, while White youths relied on Relaxation and Hobbies/Interests to a greater extent.    In addition, relationships between coping patterns and types of stressors were examined using multinomial logistic regression analysis. The existence of a relationship between “coping pattern” and the stressor “disrespect” was supported, significantly explaining 61.8 percent of the model's variance (p < .05).    The conceptual framework can be utilized in planning and developing preventive programs and interventions with runaway youths experiencing high levels of stress. Social workers and helping professionals need to demonstrate an awareness of the stressors and corresponding coping strategies among this population by providing support services grounded in a relationship of mutual respect.

T1  - Scaffolding software: How does it influence student conceptual understanding and motivation?
AN  - 305126149
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of scaffolding software on student conceptual understanding and motivation. This study also provides insight on how students use the scaffolding features found in Artemis and the extent to which features show a relationship to student conceptual understanding and motivation.    A Randomized Solomon Four Group Design was used in this study. As students worked through a project based unit over photosynthesis, the students performed information seeking activities that were based on their own inquiry. For this purpose, the students in the experimental group used an example of scaffolding software called Artemis, while the students in the control group used a search engine of their choice.    To measure conceptual understanding, the researcher analyzed student generated concept maps on photosynthesis using three different methods (quantitative, qualitative, hierarchical). To measure motivation, the researcher used a survey that measured motivation on five different indicators: intrinsic goal orientation, extrinsic goal orientation, task value, control of learning beliefs, self-efficacy for learning and performance. Finally, the researcher looked at the relationship and influence of the scaffolding features on two student performance scores at the end of the unit. This created a total of ten dependent variables in relationship to the treatment.    Overall, the students used the collaborative features 25% of the time, the maintenance features 0.84% of the time, the organizational features 16% of the time, the saving/viewing features 7% of the time and the searching features 51% of the time. There were significant correlations between the saving/viewing features hits and the students' task value (r = .499, p < .05), the searching features hits and the students' self-efficacy for learning and performance (r = .553, p < .01), the collaborative features hits and the students' essay performance scores (r = .519, p < .05) and the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps (r = .576, p < .01). Finally, the results indicated that the scaffolding features in Artemis did not influence student conceptual understanding and motivation.

T1  - The influence of police training and social learning on racial profiling
AN  - 305112928
AB  - This project is an interpretivist-constructivist qualitative research design concerning how police training and police social learning intersect and affect certain officer learning as that relates to racial profiling. The project explored the question of how do police training, which promotes technically correct police procedures and social learning, which promotes common sense problem solving approaches and intersect and influence police officer racial profiling? Through data collection with purposively sampling of ten interview subjects, the following research questions were used to explore the intersection of social learning and training: (a) how do officers socially learn to racially profile; (b) how do officers formally learn to racially profile. Lastly, (c) what role does police officer personal learning play in racial profiling. The essential processes that support qualitative interpretivist research were used to advance the data analysis process, those being concept mapping, coding developed for each of the groups of professionals interviewed. Data were analyzed using a computerized data coding system software N*VIVO. Results were reported for each of the groups of officers interviewed. The purpose of this project was to expand the understanding the adult learning experience of police officers undergo and how they formally learn the proper legal methods to construct pretextual encounters with the public.

T1  - Making the connections: Women talk about breast self examination
AN  - 305090274
AB  - Breast cancer is a serious health concern for women. Early detection has been hailed as key to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Largely as a result of three large trials that failed to demonstrate a mortality reduction with breast self examination (BSE), the usefulness of this screening method has been seriously questioned. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care concluded there was fair evidence to recommend physicians no longer routinely teach BSE to women. Through reports in the academic and lay literature, women have been advised that BSE may not only be ineffective, but harmful to them. The research problem is that there is a poor understanding of the meaning of BSE to women within a society that does not value it. Previous research on BSE was chiefly concerned with measuring women's knowledge, attitudes and beliefs related to BSE with the primary aim of increasing compliance. Yet, little was known about how women really felt about BSE. To investigate this phenomenon, women were engaged over time in a cycle of collective self-reflective inquiry to explore personal and social factors influencing their practice of BSE. This was achieved through a series of group discussions with two groups of women as they examined their everyday experiences related to BSE. Consistent with a participatory action approach, the women were considered co-researchers and were actively involved in the framing and analysis of the research problem. Thematic analysis allowed for the collaborative identification of the temporal map components that described the context of BSE for these women. These components were later organized by the women into a concept map, which provided a meaningful schematic representation of the meaning of BSE to them. Consistent with a feminist experiential approach, the standpoint of women was considered a valuable source of knowledge. Through this collective inquiry, the women developed a critical consciousness of the commonality of their personal experiences in relation to BSE, and their relationship to the larger social environment. In this way, the women were able to more fully understand the complexity of personal and social factors influencing the meaning of BSE to them, which was empowering. At the beginning of the research process, the women's subject position was characterized by their feelings of vulnerability in relation to their perceptions of breast cancer as a lethal disease and their inferior status in the world in relation to men. BSE is an intensely personal issue for women. It brings to the fore a complex web of interrelated meanings and experiences such as those related to cancer (breast cancer in particular), being a woman (and having breasts), and the health care system (including their treatment by physicians).

T1  - Exploring teacher's perceptions of concept mapping as a teaching strategy in science: An action research approach
AN  - 305068444
AB  - In order to promote science literacy in the classroom, students need opportunities in which they can personalize their understanding of the concepts they are learning. Current literature supports the use of concept maps in enabling students to make personal connections in their learning of science. Because they involve creating explicit connections between concepts, concept maps can assist students in developing metacognitive strategies and assist educators in identifying misconceptions in students' thinking. The literature also notes that concept maps can improve student achievement and recall.    Much of the current literature focuses primarily on concept mapping at the secondary and university levels, with limited focus on the elementary panel. The research rarely considers teachers' thoughts and ideas about the concept mapping process. In order to effectively explore concept mapping from the perspective of elementary teachers, I felt that an action research approach would be appropriate. Action research enabled educators to debate issues about concept mapping and test out ideas in their classrooms. It also afforded the participants opportunities to explore their own thinking, reflect on their personal journeys as educators and play an active role in their professional development.    In an effort to explore concept mapping from the perspective of elementary educators, an action research group of 5 educators and myself was established and met regularly from September 1999 until June 2000. All of the educators taught in the Toronto area. These teachers were interested in exploring how concept mapping could be used as a learning tool in their science classrooms.    In summary, this study explores the journey of five educators and myself as we engaged in collaborative action research. This study sets out to: (1) Explore how educators believe concept mapping can facilitate teaching and student learning in the science classroom. (2) Explore how educators implement concept mapping in their classrooms. (3) Identify challenges educators experience when they implement concept mapping. (4) Explore factors that impact on facilitating collaborative action research. (5) Provide insight into my growth as an action research facilitator.

T1  - The discourse of causal explanations in school science
AN  - 305056016
AB  - Researchers and educators working from a systemic functional linguistic perspective have provided a body of work on science discourse which offers an excellent starting point for examining the linguistic aspects of the development of causal discourse in school science, discourse which Derewianka (1995) claimed is critical to success in secondary school. No work has yet described the development of causal language by identifying the linguistic features present in oral discourse or by comparing the causal discourse of native and non-native (ESL) speakers of English.    The current research responds to this gap by examining the oral discourse collected from ESL and non-ESL students at the primary and high school grades. Specifically, it asks the following questions: (1) How do the teachers and students in these four contexts develop causal explanations and their relevant taxonomies through classroom interactions? (2) What are the causal discourse features being used by the students in these four contexts to construct oral causal explanations?    The findings of the social practice analysis showed that the teachers in the four contexts differed in their approaches to teaching, with the primary school mainstream teacher focusing largely on the hands-on practice , the primary school ESL teacher moving from practice to theory, the high school mainstream teacher moving from theory to practice, and the high school ESL teacher relying primarily on  theory.    The findings from the quantitative, small corpus approach suggest that the developmental path of cause which has been identified in the writing of experts shows up not only in written texts but also in the oral texts which learners construct. Moreover, this move appears when the discourse of high school ESL and non-ESL students is compared, suggesting a developmental progression in the acquisition of these features by these students. The findings also reveal that the knowledge constructed, as shown by the concept maps created from the discourse, follows a developmental path similar to the linguistic causal path, from the concrete, hands-on, observable items to more abstract, theoretical concepts.    This study is the first systemic functional comparison of the oral discourse of primary and secondary learners as well as the first to compare ESL and non-ESL speakers in this way, and as such it helps map general trends in causal discourse development.

T1  - A speech communication course concept for Marine Corps Command and Staff College in partnership with Northern Virginia Community College -Woodbridge
AN  - 305048972
AB  - This dissertation defines a speech communication course concept by examining a perceived speech communication shortfall at Marine Corps Command and Staff College (CSC), Marine Corps University (MCU), Quantico, Virginia. The CSC was selected because of the important academic work it performs in service to our country, and an awareness discovered through preliminary research that CSC students need but are not provided with any substantive speech communication education and training during their attendance at the 84-year-old college. A supporting reason to focus this effort at CSC was to connect a learning shortfall at that college with a reasonable learning solution: Northern Virginia Community College (NVCC)-Woodbridge. Partnering with a community college is at the heart of the Doctor of Arts in Community College Education program because it looks to community college faculty to investigate a particular academic problem and then design, develop, and deliver a solution that meets the needs of the community—like CSC.    This dissertation used a combined qualitative and quantitative research strategy that surveyed students from two academic years (2002–03 and 2003–04) at Command and Staff College, as well as students and faculty from one academic year (2003–04) at Marine Corps War College (MCWAR), and interviewed selected Marine Corps University leaders. Quantitative analysis to interpret survey responses was achieved by using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) software. Qualitative data collected from interview responses were coded and grouped into categories using concept mapping. Concept mapping was then used to compare and organize survey and interview responses.    Analysis determined that (a) there is a need for speech communication instruction at CSC, (b) that due to an already full curriculum, instruction should parallel, support, and be integrated into the learning objectives of existing CSC courses, and (c) learning objectives should focus on improving CSC students' ability to design and deliver information briefs using clear, concise, and accurate language. My findings also suggest that partnering with the speech communication faculty at NVCC-Woodbridge, through its Workforce Development Department, is the most efficient and practical way to teach speech communication at CSC.

T1  - Use of concept mapping to clarify misconceptions about natural selection in an all-male high school biology classroom
AN  - 305035139
AB  - This quasi-experimental study examined the effectiveness of concept mapping to help students understand natural selection and to reduce their misconceptions as measured by the Conceptual Inventory of Natural Selection (CINS) (Anderson, Fisher and Norman, 2002). The study was conducted at a private all-male high school with tenth-grade students in three college preparatory biology classes. Results indicate that CINS is a valid and reliable measure of student conceptions and misconceptions about natural selection for this population. CINS scores were not better for those students who made concept maps about evolution. Many misconceptions persisted following instruction. No correlation was found between student CINS and concept map scores. Concept maps scores were not a valid measure of conceptual understanding for this population of students. The failure of this study to reduce student misconceptions about natural selection makes it clear that more work is necessary to help improve student learning about natural selection.

T1  - How do students navigate and learn from nonlinear science texts: Can metanavigation support promote science learning?
AN  - 305343471
AB  - Digital texts which are based on hypertext and hypermedia technologies are now being used to support science learning. Hypertext offers certain opportunities for learning as well as difficulties that challenge readers to become metacognitively aware of their navigation decisions in order to trade both meaning and structure while reading. The goal of this study was to investigate whether supporting sixth grade students to monitor and regulate their navigation behavior while reading from hypertext would lead to better navigation and learning.  Metanavigation support in the form of prompts was provided to groups of students who used a hypertext system called CoMPASS to complete a design challenge. The metanavigation prompts aimed at encouraging students to understand the affordances of the navigational aids in CoMPASS and use them to guide their navigation.    The study was conducted in a real classroom setting during the implementation of CoMPASS in sixth grade science classes. Multiple sources of group and individual data were collected and analyzed. Measures included student's individual performance in a pre-science knowledge test, the Metacognitive Awareness of Reading Strategies Inventory (MARSI), a reading comprehension test and a concept map test. Process measures included log file information that captured group navigation paths during the use of CoMPASS. The results suggested that providing metanavigation support enabled the groups to make coherent transitions among the text units. Findings also revealed that reading comprehension, presence of metanavigation support and prior domain knowledge significantly predicted students' individual understanding of science. Implications for hypertext design and literacy research fields are discussed.

T1  - An analysis of learning in an online biology course for teachers and teacher candidates: A mixed methods approach
AN  - 305339248
AB  - Due to discipline specific shortages, web-based learning has been proposed as a convenient way to upgrade the content knowledge of instructors interested in learning to teach science. Despite quantitative evidence that web-based instruction is equivalent to traditional methods, questions remain regarding its use. The efficiency and practicality of this approach with teachers in particular has not been extensively studied. This investigation examines learning in an online biology course designed to help teachers prepare for science certification exams. Research questions concern flow teachers learn biology in the online environment and how this setting influences the learning process. Quantitative and qualitative methodologies are employed in an attempt to provide a more complete perspective than typical studies of online learning. Concept maps, tests, and online discussion transcripts are compared as measures of assimilated knowledge, while interviews reflect participants’ views on the course. Findings indicate that participants experienced gains in declarative knowledge, but little improvement with respect to conditional knowledge. Qualitative examination of concept maps demonstrates gaps in participants’ understandings of key course ideas. Engagement in the use of online resources varied according to participants’ attitudes towards online learning. Subjects also reported a lack of motivation to fully engage in the course due to busy teaching schedules and the absence of accountability.

T1  - Generation of concept maps from medical index terms for diagrammatic reasoning in physiology tutorials
AN  - 305333755
AB  - In an effort to demonstrate that diagrammatic reasoning helps people learn new concepts and the relationships between them, we developed a suite of tutorial programs in physiology. The tutorials are based on causal concept mapping. A causal concept map represents a set of causal relationships in a directed graph. We use causal concept maps as a knowledge representation method for medical education to help people understand concepts by presenting the relationships between them in a visual way.    The software consists of a tutorial on causal relationships, an exercise in concept map building, and concept mapper tutorials designed to help students understand the complex negative feedback systems that control blood pressure and breathing in the human body. Our concept mapper tutorial systems help the student build the nodes in the concept map corresponding to the important parameters and then add the causal relationships between them. A prototype authoring tool was also built to help instructors move the system to new domains.    The concept mapper tutorials were evaluated with first year medical students. There were significant differences in their scores during the pre-test and the post-test, suggesting that the tutorials were effective in improving the student's understanding of the physiology concepts. We also report the results of a user survey about our concept mapper system. Use of different colors to identify separate groups of concepts in our concept maps appeared to play an important role in the students' learning process, although this needs to be further demonstrated in future research.    We have also built a concept map from the index terms in a medical textbook for the purpose of constructing and analyzing relationships among the medical terms. Related words from the index entries are connected to each other and displayed graphically to help medical students comprehend the conceptual relationships. The concept map contains the whole collection of index terms in the textbook. A part of the concept map can serve as the basis of a tutorial to provide medical students with necessary knowledge through diagrammatic representation.

T1  - Student and faculty perceptions of nursing education culture and its impact on minority students
AN  - 305333335
AB  - The nursing profession, a predominately white, women's profession, is facing two problems: an increasing nursing shortage, and failure to reflect the United States' growing ethnic and racial diversity. Increased cultural diversity among nurse educators and practitioners is a necessary step to solving both problems, yet recruitment and persistence efforts have fallen short. Minority nursing students have been noted to have more academic difficulty evidenced by lower GPAs and higher program attrition. Traditional explanations such as poor academic preparation or lack of financial support do not adequately explain the difference in performance. This study investigated minority persistence in nursing education from a cultural viewpoint, looking at the impact of higher education and nursing education culture on minority student persistence and performance, and the role of nursing faculty within this culture. This study's purpose was to examine nursing education culture, barriers to success for minority students, and facilitative educational practices. Semi-structured interviews with 43 African-American and white nursing faculty (14) and students (29) from 13 baccalaureate and one community college program were conducted. A concept map was developed describing student processes of Belonging and Becoming a Nurse, and the impact of the nursing program, conflict between nursing values and norms, and welcoming or unwelcoming actions by faculty, students and administrators on student success. Key findings were: a universal perception of struggle in nursing education; the pervasive and negative impact of racial prejudice on black students' experience; the positive impact of welcoming actions and negative impact of unwelcoming actions by faculty, students and administrators on student success; the need for welcoming by all three groups in the nursing program; a conflict between nursing education's values and norms or typical behaviors of nurse educators; and the key role of faculty in influencing minority student success. Implications for practice, policy and research are presented.

T1  - Information use and meaningful learning
AN  - 305325145
AB  - This study investigates how high school students use information to learn. Conducted within the broad conceptual framework of a constructivist adaptation of learning theory, the study defines the “success” of students' information seeking as it relates to their meaningful learning experience as a whole.    In order to study students' information seeking as a meaningful learning experience, four foreshadowing questions were set out: (1) How do students initially understand information and information sources? (2) How do information structures of information sources affect students' understanding about their topics? (3) What strategies do students use for restructuring information? and (4) How is students' information use reflected in their products related to learning tasks?    Within the methodological framework of naturalistic inquiry, the study used a combination of concept maps and interviews as a unique method for investigating changes in students' understanding based on their use of information. Twenty-one high school juniors in an honors class in persuasive speech were observed in their library media center while performing required learning tasks; eight of the students, their teacher, and the library media specialist were interviewed. Data were analyzed both manually and with the support of data management software.    Overall, the findings suggest that students' learning in an information-rich environment is dynamic and that students learn interactively and serendipitously. Several streams of analysis suggest more specific findings within these larger ones. To structure part of the analysis, Mayer's (1999) three processes for meaningful learning—selecting, organizing, and integrating—were extended to include two additional processes particularly important in information seeking: gathering and using. Findings suggest that all of these five processes are intertwined and dynamically related and the process of “using” information had a particular effect on students' understanding about their topics as they created their final products. Additionally, four types of changes were identified as students conducted their information seeking and created their final products: simple, analytic, organizational, and holistic. Analyzed within the framework of the revised Bloom's Taxonomy of Educational Objectives (Anderson and Krathwohl, 2001), the data revealed that students' learning progressed through all six levels of the taxonomy as they engaged with information.

T1  - The effects of collaborative concept mapping on the achievement, science self -efficacy and attitude toward science of female eighth-grade students
AN  - 305323932
AB  - This study sought to examine whether collaborative concept mapping would affect the achievement, science self-efficacy and attitude toward science of female eighth grade science students.    The research questions are: (1) Will the use of collaborative concept mapping affect the achievement of female students in science? (2) Will the use of collaborative concept mapping affect the science self-efficacy of female students? (3) Will the use of collaborative concept mapping affect the attitudes of females toward science?    The study was quasi-experimental and utilized a pretest-posttest design for both experimental and control groups. Eighth grade female and male students from three schools in a large northeastern school district participated in this study.    The achievement test consisted of 10 multiple choice and two open-response questions and used questions from state-wide and national assessments as well as teacher-constructed items. A 29 item Likert type instrument (McMillan, 1992) was administered to measure science self-efficacy and attitude toward science.    The study was of 12 weeks duration. During the study, experimental group students were asked to perform collaborative concept map construction in single sex dyads using specific terms designated by the classroom teacher and the researcher. During classroom visitations, student perceptions of collaborative concept mapping were collected and were used to provide insight into the results of the quantitative data analysis. Data from the pre and posttest instruments were analyzed for both experimental and control groups using t-tests. Additionally, the three teachers were interviewed and their perceptions of the study were also used to gain insight into the results of the study.    The analysis of data showed that experimental group females showed significantly higher gains in achievement than control group females. An additional analysis of data showed experimental group males showed significantly greater gains in achievement than experimental group females.    The analysis of science self-efficacy data showed that neither experimental nor control group females increased their scores pre to posttest, both showed small decreases in scores. However, the posttest scores of the experimental group females were significantly higher than the posttest scores of the control group females.    The analysis of the attitude toward science survey data showed that the scores of the experimental group females did not change from pre to posttest. However, scores of the control group females declined from pre to posttest. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - The impact of whole -plant instruction of preservice teachers' understanding of plant science principles
AN  - 305321141
AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine how an inquiry-based, whole-plant instructional strategy would affect preservice elementary teachers' understanding of plant science principles. This study probed: what preservice teachers know about plant biology concepts before and after instruction, their views of the interrelatedness of plant parts and the environment, how growing a plant affects preservice teachers' understanding, and which types of activity-rich plant themes studies, if any, affect preservice elementary teachers' understandings. The participants in the study were enrolled in two elementary science methods class sections at a state university. Each group was administered a preinstructional test at the beginning of the study. The treatment group participated in inquiry-based activities related to the Principles of Plant Biology (American Society of Plant Biologists, 2001), while the comparison group studied those same concepts through traditional instructional methods. A focus group was formed from the treatment group to participate in co-concept mapping sessions. The participants' understandings were assessed through artifacts from activities, a comparison of pre- and postinstructional tests, and the concept maps generated by the focus group. Results of the research indicated that the whole-plant, inquiry-based instructional strategy can be applied to teach preservice elementary teachers plant biology while modeling the human constructivist approach. The results further indicated that this approach enhanced their understanding of plant science content knowledge, as well as pedagogical knowledge. The results also showed that a whole-plant approach to teaching plant science concepts is an instructional strategy that is feasible for the elementary school. The theoretical framework for this study was Human Constructivist learning theory (Mintzes & Wandersee, 1998). The content knowledge and instructional strategy was informed by the Principles of Plant Biology  (American Society of Plant Biologists, 2001) and Botany for the Next Millennium (Botanical Society of America, 1995). As a result of this study, a better understanding of the factors that influence preservice elementary teachers' knowledge of plant science principles may benefit elementary science educator in preparing teachers that are “highly qualified.”

T1  - High school chemistry students' learning of the elements, structure, and periodicity of the periodic table: Contributions of inquiry -based activities and exemplary graphics
AN  - 305320813
AB  - The main research question of this study was: How do selected high school chemistry students' understandings of the elements, structure, and periodicity of the Periodic Table change as they participate in a unit study consisting of inquiry-based activities emphasizing construction of innovative science graphics? The research question was answered using a multiple case study/mixed model design which employed elements of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies during data collection and analyses.    The unit study was conducted over a six-week period with 11th -grade students enrolled in a chemistry class. A purposive sample of six students from the class was selected to participate in interviews and concept map coconstruction (Wandersee & Abrams, 1993) periodically across the study. The progress of the selected students of the case study was compared to the progress of the class as a whole. The students of the case study were also compared to a group of high school chemistry students at a comparative school.    The results show that the students from both schools left traditional instruction on the periodic table (lecture and textbook activities) with a very limited understanding of the topic. It also revealed that the inquiry-based, visual approach of the unit study helped students make significant conceptual progress in their understanding of the periodic table. The pictorial periodic table (which features photographs of the elements), used in conjunction with the graphic technique of data mapping, enhanced students understanding of the patterns of the physical properties of the elements on the periodic table. The graphic technique of compound mapping helped students learn reactivity patterns between types and groups of elements on the periodic table. The recreation of the periodic table with element cards created from the pictorial periodic table helped students progress in their understanding of periodicity and its key concepts. The Periodic Table Literacy Rubric (PTLR) proved to be a valuable tool for assessing students' conceptual progress, and helped to identify a critical juncture in the learning of periodicity. In addition, the PTLR rubric's historical-conceptual design demonstrates how the history of science can be used to inform today's science teaching.

T1  - The gathering and use of information by fifth -grade students with access to Palm handhelds
AN  - 305314454
AB  - Handheld computers may hold the possibility for a one-to-one computer: student ratio. The impact of the use of Palm® (Palm, Inc.) handhelds on information acquisition and use by 5th grade students in a North Texas school during a class research project was investigated. Five research questions were examined using observation, interviews, surveys, and document analysis. Are there differences in information gathering and use with the Palm between gifted, dyslexic, and regular learners? What relevance criteria do students use to evaluate a web site to determine whether to download the site to the Palm and afterwards whether to use the downloaded site's information in the report? How do the Palms affect the writing process? Do the animations and concept maps produced on the Palm demonstrate understanding of the intended concepts? Are there significant differences in results (i.e., final products grade) between Palm users and non-Palm users?    Three groups of learners in the class, gifted, dyslexic, and regular learners, participated in the study. The regular and dyslexic students reported using Web sites that had not been downloaded to the Palm. Students reported several factors used to decide whether to download Web sites, but the predominant deciding factor was the amount of information. The students used a combination of writing on paper and the Palm in the preparation of the report. Many students flipped between two programs, FreeWrite and Fling-It, finding information and then writing the facts into the report. The peer review process was more difficult with the Palm. Most students had more grammatical errors in this research report than in previous research projects. By creating animated drawings on the Palm handheld, the students demonstrated their understanding of the invention though sometimes the media or the student's drawing skills limited the quality of the final product. Creating the animations was motivational and addressed different learning styles than a written report alone. No statistically significant difference was found in the scores of the three 6+1 Traits categories, however the Palm users didn't meet the page-length requirement for the research project but the majority of the control class did.

T1  - Case studies of community college non -science majors: Effects of self -regulatory interventions on biology self-efficacy and biological literacy
AN  - 305305022
AB  - Science literacy has been at the heart of current reform efforts in science education. The focus on developing essential skills needed for individual ability to be literate in science has been at the forefront of most K–12 science curricula. Reform efforts have begun to stretch into the postsecondary arena as well, with an ever increasing dialogue regarding the need for attention to science literacy by college students, especially non-science majors. This study set out to investigate how the use of self-regulatory interventions (specifically, goal setting, concept mapping, and reflective writing) affected student biology self-efficacy and biological literacy.    This study employed a qualitative research design, analyzing three case studies. Participants in the study received ten self-regulatory interventions as a set of portfolio assignments. Portfolio work was qualitatively analyzed and coded for self-efficacy, as well as evidence of biological literacy. A biology self-efficacy survey was administered pre- and post- to provide a means of self-efficacy data triangulation. Literacy data was supported via a biological literacy rubric, constructed specifically for this study.    Results indicated that mastery experiences were the source of biology self-efficacy. Self-efficacy for specific tasks increased over time, and changes in self-efficacy were corroborated by the self-efficacy survey.    Students were found to express biological literacy at nominal, functional, or conceptual levels depending on the specific task. This was supported by data from the biological literacy rubric scores.    Final conclusions and implications for the study indicated the need for further research with more samples of students in similar and different contexts. Given the fact that the literature in this area is sparse, the results obtained here have only begun to delve into this area of research. Generalization to other biology courses or contexts outside of the one presented in this study was cautioned until future studies can be conducted.

T1  - Visualizing understandings online: Nontraditional pharmacy students' experiences with concept mapping
AN  - 305304962
AB  - Learning with technology is a challenge for both designers of and students in online degree programs. Due to new accreditation standards, pharmacists are returning to school. Pharmacy professionals, looking to update their skills, understandings and degree, find themselves overwhelmed with new information and are often without the capacity to incorporate it effectively into their practice. The implications for postsecondary education are profound. Information overload is the operative mode in which students and teachers now exist. Learning in this information rich environment requires different tools and pedagogical methods than are currently used in online learning environments. This dissertation is a report of how pharmacists can learn and communicate in new ways to become better practitioners and better learners.    The practical work of developing and testing usable knowledge about online learning environments requires a fundamental understanding of the learning and technology experiences students bring with them to their learning environment, conceptual change processes, information visualization tools to help students visualize what they know, and collaborative learning pedagogies to facilitate sharing of students' understandings.    This study explores the role of concept mapping as a tool to help students visualize what they know and to communicate their understandings with other students in an online learning community. While the pharmacists did concept map their understandings and acknowledged the benefits of working together, they did not share their concept maps. This study proposes a collaborative online learning community model for nontraditional students to explain these results. The model suggests the following. First, becoming an expert with a new tool takes time, hands on experience and may be a prerequisite to using the tool to learn and communicate in a learning community. Second, for students to move past public presentation of their ideas and into collaborative peer review of others' understandings, teachers must understand the decision making risk analysis nontraditional students employ. Third, building functional learning communities is difficult and takes time.    Further research is needed to determine if these changes in how concept mapping is implemented and prioritized affect nontraditional students' sharing of understandings in online learning environments. GIF, QuickTime and WAV files are included.

T1  - Metaphor and content: An embodied paradigm for learning
AN  - 305301036
AB  - Through a direct application of two cognitive science theories, conceptual metaphor (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980, 1999) and structure mapping (Gentner, 1983, 1989; Gentner & Markman, 1995), this project defined an instructional design model for the design, development, and assessment of metaphor-enhanced, computer-mediated learning environments. It used the model to produce an instructional product with a metaphor-based interface. The project also built a parallel learning environment that employed a concept map interface. To test the metaphor-based product's effectiveness at enabling learners to build rich mental models of a complex, abstract concept, the project ran fifty-seven preservice teachers (55 female, 2 male; mean age of 21) through the instruction, randomly assigning half to the concept map interface environment and half to the metaphor-based interface environment. Participants completed four essay-type assessment questions. Trained raters, blind to participant assignment, isolated any of the 13 targeted concepts present within participants' protocols and, through consensus, constructed a concept map for each participant, representing that participant's mental model of the targeted domain. Map attributes were translated into four weighted subscores (nodes, branches, levels, and cross-links) and summed. Comparison across the two groups indicated no significant difference for richness of mental model, t(55) = −.72, p > .05, although the discussion suggests methods for increasing the power in subsequent experimental sessions. A significant interaction between Subscore and Achievement,  F(3, 51) = 3142, p < .01, suggests that concept map crosslinks are much more sensitive to differences in domain integration and the general richness of a participant's mental model than the level and branch subscores. This result has implications for classroom application. Concept maps have taken a place as a learner's, a teacher's, and a researcher's tool. With cross-domain validation and domain-specific extensions, specification of the relative sensitivity of various subscales, that is, the structure of the concept map, will enable educators to justify weighting scales and identify learner achievement. Credible concept map weighting scales also enhance learners' self-reliant and impartial assessment of personal growth in domain-specific knowledge. Results suggest that learners who have difficulty integrating domain concepts require direct, explicit instruction to help them to make connections between disparate conceptual strands.

T1  - A comparison of the performance and perceptions of students receiving live versus Web -based horticultural instruction
AN  - 305297965
AB  - The primary purpose of this dissertation was to examine whether the level of student learning in horticulture was equivalent in both web-based and traditional live instruction and to compare perceptions of students towards different modes of instruction.    The study in chapter two addressed whether student performance and perceptions differed between the web-based and traditional versions of an introductory horticulture course. The increase in quiz scores from pre- to post-course surveys suggested that students receiving traditional instruction acquired more knowledge than did web-based students. Web-based students' preference for instructional mode changed from web-based to traditional during the semester. Pre-course quiz score, GPA, age, and distance living from campus were correlated with final grades in both instructional modes.    The study in chapter three investigated whether students were able to identify plants after studying the plants online just as well as after studying them traditionally at the greenhouse. Students in the traditional group had greater total quiz scores than web-based students. Students were able to identify plants from photos just as well as from live plant specimens.    In chapter four, the experiment addressed whether student comprehension was different among three methods of delivery after receiving a lesson on a topic that was either predominantly text-based (photosynthesis) or object-based (plant identification). The three delivery methods were: (1)  independent learning using a text handout, (2) traditional learning involving a summary lecture and a text handout, and (3)  independent web-based learning with the lesson on the computer. There were no differences in student performance among the three delivery methods and no interaction between topic and delivery method. Participants generally had greater scores on the multiple choice tests than on the concept mapping tests where they had difficulty recalling the concepts they learned.    The study in chapter five addressed whether student performance and perceptions were equivalent between disabled and non-disabled students receiving traditional or web-based horticultural instruction. Non-disabled students had greater final grades, expressed less frustration and found the course more acceptable than did their non-disabled counterparts in both modes of instruction.

T1  - Identity, competency, and autonomy of medical social workers in acute care settings
AN  - 305293885
AB  - This study examined the sense of identity, competency, and autonomy of staff-level medical social workers in acute hospital settings. A purposive sample included social workers in decentralized settings, combined departments, and centralized departments without social work supervisors and those with social work supervision. The methodology combined concept mapping using the Concept System© and Interactive Qualitative Analysis, a participatory qualitative research method, to reveal a theoretical model grounded in data from focus groups. Fifteen themes in the participants' daily work were compared for frequency, importance, decision-making autonomy, and educational preparation across departmental structure, the supervisor's professional affiliation, and the social workers' characteristics. The primary organizational structure found for social work in hospitals was a merged department.    Organizational structure influenced professional preparation for competent practice, activities defining social work identity, and professional autonomy with negative correlations for those with nurses as supervisors. Findings suggest that social work identity, competency, and autonomy are in serious jeopardy in hospital practice, and the profession is adrift. Medical social workers are not clear how to impact organizations undergoing change. Social workers in health care are isolated, not connected across hospital systems or with professional organizations. Findings indicate social workers do not function as interdisciplinary team members, nor do they increase their professional leverage. The implication from this research is that leadership, team membership, and an understanding of organizational dynamics are missing from hospital social work practice. Social work education and the social work profession have failed to provide a base for building a strong identity in health care. The mental health, or private practice, model is the dominant professional identity and that hospital social workers were not involved in research or community change. This research suggests that clinical practice skills, such as Short term counseling, only developed under social work supervision. Despite rapidly expanding technological capabilities to treat disease, there is less attention to developing resources and competencies that address psychosocial needs for both individual and community health. Bilingual social workers were more involved with professional development, consultation, and communication with administration. The implications for social work practice and social work education are discussed.

T1  - Video programmes as learning tools: Teaching the gas laws and behaviour of gases in Finnish and Canadian senior high schools
AN  - 305229047
AB  - The main object of this experimental study was to test how video programmes used in a Physics minicourse dealing with gases affect learning outcomes. The theoretical framework was based on cognitive psychology, particularly schema theories, science learning studies, and educational technology studies, especially studies concerning television and videos in instruction. The treatment groups were two task groups and four video groups, altogether 8 groups. One of the task groups had written learning tasks prior to viewing a video programme section or teaching and the other had no tasks. Three of the video groups each had a different version of the video programme dealing with gases and the fourth group was a control group using no videos. Sixteen physics groups (total n = 358) from the province of Central Finland, Keski-Suomi, were randomly selected and assigned to the treatment groups. All the physics groups used the same “Student Textbook” and “Student Workbook” specifically developed for the study. Data were collected with a number of quantitative and qualitative methods, of which a combined concept map + essay represented a new type of method. The validity and reliability of the data collection methods were considered to be quite good. Also the internal and external validity of the experimental design were reasonably good. The main results suggested that students using video programmes did not learn more than students not using video programmes when learning about the gas laws, whereas in learning about the kinetic theory of gases, students using a video programme learned more than students not using video programmes. Students using learning tasks prior to viewing a video programme section/teaching of a sub-topic often learned significantly more than students not using learning tasks. Senior high school students' knowledge of gases was not particularly good. Students' attitudes towards school and physics were quite positive. Most students had either positive or neutral attitudes towards studying gases. The results imply that with proper planning and pedagogical approaches, video programmes can considerably facilitate physics learning.

T1  - High School Chemistry Students' Learning of the Elements, Structure, and Periodicity of the Periodic Table: Contributions of Inquiry-Based Activities and Exemplary Graphics
AN  - 2674919061
AB  - The main research question of this study was: How do selected high school chemistry students' understandings of the elements, structure, and periodicity of the Periodic Table change as they participate in a unit study consisting of inquiry-based activities emphasizing construction of innovative science graphics? The research question was answered using a multiple case study/mixed model design which employed elements of both qualitative and quantitative methodologies during data collection and analyses.The unit study was conducted over a six-week period with 11th-grade high school students enrolled in a chemistry class. A purposive sample of six students from the class was selected to participate in interviews and concept map coconstruction (Wandersee & Abrams, 1993) periodically across the study. The progress of the selected students of the case study was compared to the progress of the class as a whole. The students of the case study were also compared to a group of high school chemistry students at a comparative school.The results show that the students from both schools left traditional instruction on the periodic table (lecture and textbook activities) with a very limited understanding of the topic. It also revealed that the inquiry-based, visual approach of the unit study helped students make significant conceptual progress in their understanding of the periodic table. The pictorial periodic table (which features photographs of the elements), used in conjunction with the graphic technique of data mapping, enhanced students understanding of the patterns of the physical properties of the elements on the periodic table. The graphic technique of compound mapping helped students learn reactivity patterns between types and groups of elements on the periodic table. The recreation of the periodic table with element cards created from the pictorial periodic table helped students progress in their understanding of periodicity and its key concepts. The Periodic Table Literacy Rubric (PTLR) proved to be a valuable tool for assessing students’ conceptual progress, and helped to identify a critical juncture in the learning of periodicity. In addition, the PTLR rubric’s historical-conceptual design demonstrates how the history of science can be used to inform today’s science teaching.

T1  - The Impact of Whole-Plant Instruction Preservice Elementary Teachers' Understanding of Plant Science Principles
AN  - 2674875639
AB  - The purpose of this research was to determine how an inquiry-based, whole-plant instructional strategy would affect preservice elementary teachers’ understanding of plant science principles. This study probed: what preservice teachers know about plant biology concepts before and after instruction, their views of the interrelatedness of plant parts and the environment, how growing a plant affects preservice teachers’ understanding, and which types of activity-rich plant themes studies, if any, affect preservice elementary teachers’ understandings. The participants in the study were enrolled in two elementary science methods class sections at a state university. Each group was administered a preinstructional test at the beginning of the study. The treatment group participated in inquiry-based activities related to the Principles of Plant Biology (American Society of Plant Biologists, 2001), while the comparison group studied those same concepts through traditional instructional methods. A focus group was formed from the treatment group to participate in co-concept mapping sessions. The participants’ understandings were assessed through artifacts from activities, a comparison of pre- and postinstructional tests, and the concept maps generated by the focus group. Results of the research indicated that the whole-plant, inquiry-based instructional strategy can be applied to teach preservice elementary teachers plant biology while modeling the human constructivist approach. The results further indicated that this approach enhanced their understanding of plant science content knowledge, as well as pedagogical knowledge. The results also showed that a whole-plant approach to teaching plant science concepts is an instructional strategy that is feasible for the elementary school. The theoretical framework for this study was Human Constructivist learning theory (Mintzes&Wandersee, 1998). The content knowledge and instructional strategy was informed by the Principles of Plant Biology (American Society of Plant Biologists, 2001) and Botany for the Next Millennium (Botanical Society of America, 1995). As a result of this study, a better understanding of the factors that influence preservice elementary teachers’ knowledge of plant science principles may benefit elementary science educator in preparing teachers that are “highly qualified.”

T1  - Application of concept mapping on Web browsing
AN  - 230821943
AB  - An interface with the concept mapping technique was implemented to research whether such an interface has advantages for web browsing over the common interface used by Internet Explorer. The functions implemented in the interface included tree-spread, tree-collapse, target searching/highlighting, and so on. Comparison testing was designed and performed to measure the performance of the user using both interfaces to find information in a web site. Results show that concept mapping interface has an advantage over Internet Explorer during early testing, while Internet Explorer has better performance during later testing, indicating that the concept mapping technique is a useful tool for learning new information/knowledge. On the other hand, because real web sites usually have tens or hundreds of sub-links, and the relationship between the URL string and the real content of the page is often very limited, the application of this technique on web browsing is probably not practical.

T1  - Recurrent participation in RockCamp: Perceptions of a K–12 professional development program in geology
AN  - 305531516
AB  - The geological experiences of six teachers with a history of sustained participation in the RockCamp geology professional development program were investigated. The research premise was based on Gordon's (1961, 1971) and Joyce and Weil's (1996) descriptions of the usefulness of synectics to present new ways of looking at familiar situations. The overarching goal was to delineate both reasons for participation and tropologically characterizations of their recurrent (sustained) participation. Qualitative data reflecting participatory perceptions were obtained using a series of three semi-structured interviews and an individually variable number of follow-up sessions. Additional data were derived from participant-constructed concept maps and a creative writing assignment. Participants also acted as overreaders when given the opportunity to review and comment on my representation of their ideas. Key ideas to emerge from this study were unanimous agreement that efficacy, fun, social conditions, and support are reasons for RockCamp recurrence. The study group also unanimously agreed recurrence was best tropologically characterized as an activity and an object. It was discovered that the interview method was most productive way for participants to “make the familiar strange.” Concept mapping and creative writing produced mixed results. It was found that use of tropes did stimulate some, but not all, participants to more deeply explore their recurrent participation. However, the synthesis of unique individual tropes into more inclusive thematic units diluted their effectiveness. It was unexpectedly determined that the recurrent experiences of these participants can best be philosophically characterized as being the result of a learning community grounded in adult situated learning theory. When combined with RockCamp's “3C” (compare, contrast, and connect) pedagogy, and the existing literature on effective K–12 professional development, this study suggests the recurrent participation of these teachers represents a meaningful approach to constructive professional development in geology.*   This dissertation is a multimedia document (contains text and other applications not available in printed format).

T1  - Effects of the level of generativity in concept mapping with knowledge of correct response feedback on learning
AN  - 305522959
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of blending both feedback and concept map generation on learning terminology and learner comprehension. The overall effect of each treatment was measured by individual scores on the total criterion test, the terminology test, and the comprehension test.    This study also investigated those instances in which there was a significant difference between test scores of learner generated concept map items versus those that were matched to researcher generated concept map items by students who used partially generated concept maps with feedback and those without feedback.    The sample population of the study included 150 freshmen students at a large northeastern university. There was a mix of male (n = 79) and female (n = 71) students, in both science (n = 55) and non-science (n = 95) majors.    The findings in this study indicated that: (a) the use of concept mapping was not significantly different from those who did not use concept mapping on the criterion test scores; (b) those who did not receive feedback (totally generated and partially generated maps) did significantly better than those with feedback on the comprehension test score; (c) those working with the partially generated maps with feedback did significantly better on the terminology test score items that matched on the learner generated items versus those that matched the researcher generated ones; and (d) there were significant differences between science and non-science majors, with science majors doing significantly better on the terminology test.

T1  - Faculty conceptions about the teaching and learning of problem -solving in introductory calculus -based physics
AN  - 305516710
AB  - Researchers and curriculum developers have developed a wide variety of curricular materials and instructional strategies that have been shown to be effective in improving student problem solving performance. Relatively few physics faculty, however, have chosen to use them. One likely reason is that these curricular materials and instructional strategies do not align with the ways that faculty think about the teaching and learning of problem solving.    This study is the first stage of a research program to understand faculty conceptions of the teaching and learning of problem solving. Interviews with six physics faculty from a large research university were used to generate an initial explanatory model of faculty conceptions. The interview was designed around three types of concrete instructional artifacts (3 instructor solutions, 5 student solutions, 4 types of problems).    Based on an in-depth analysis of the interview transcripts, a model of faculty conceptions was developed that consists of 14 general features. The basic relationships between these 14 general features are described in a concept map that is common to all six faculty. For example, there are three distinct ways that faculty think students can learn how to solve physics problems: (1) by solving problems on their own; (2) by using feedback while/after working on problems; (3) by watching someone else solve problems or describe how to solve problems.    Concept maps are also used to describe each of the 14 general features. For some of the general features, all six faculty have similar conceptions. For example, they all classify their students in terms of intelligence/natural ability and learning characteristics (e.g. motivation, study habits, etc.) and use these characteristics to explain why some students succeed and some students fail. For other general features, there is more than one distinct conception. For example, the model shows three different ways that these faculty conceive of the problem solving process: (1) three think of it as a linear decision-making process; (2) two think of it as a process of exploration and trial and error; and (3) one thinks of it as an art form that is different for each problem.

T1  - Theory to practice: A study of science teachers' pedagogical practices as measured by the Science Teacher Analysis Matrix (STAM) and Teacher Pedagogical Philosophy Interview (TPPI)
AN  - 305514183
AB  - This study continued research previously conducted by a nine-university collaborative, the Salish I Research Project, by exploring science teachers' beliefs and actions with regard to inquiry instruction. Science education reform efforts require that students learn science via inquiry. The purpose of this study was to determine and classify espoused teaching beliefs and observable teaching style. Reported are linkages between the teachers' beliefs and styles, influential coursework from College of Education and College of Liberal Arts, and outcomes of increased classroom experience. Eight participants were chosen from three separate preservice science education cohorts.    Inquiry efforts require a student-centered environment as opposed to the traditional teacher-centered environment. According to the 1997 Salish I Research Collaborative, beginning teachers displayed a stark contrast between their student centered beliefs to their teacher-centered actions. The limitations of this study were as follows: (1) the participants had completed the authentic research-based inquiry science course, Knowing and Teaching Science: Just Do It; (2) the participants were currently teaching science at the secondary level; (3) the selected instruments were used in the Salish I Research Collaborative Study, and (4) instrument validity and reliability data were not available. Interview data from the  Teacher Pedagogical Philosophy Interview (TPPI) instrument and observational data from the Secondary Science Teacher Analysis Matrix (STAM) instrument were statistically compiled via concept maps and matrices. Data were then represented on an ordinal scale.    Interview results indicated that 87.5% of the participants professed a teacher-centered style with regard to teacher and student's actions. Observational results indicated that 56% of the participants displayed a teacher-centered style with regard to content, teacher's actions, student's actions, resources, and environment. Additionally, 36% of the participants displayed a conceptual style, which has characteristics of both teacher and student-centered domains. Linkages between the interview and observational data were unexpected due to the fact that participants professed a slightly greater teacher-centered style along the inquiry instruction continuum than what they actually practiced.    This study reported congruity between what the participants believed and what they practiced. A negligible change regarding inquiry beliefs and instruction was discovered among the three cohorts as years of teaching experience increased.

T1  - Evaluating the effectiveness of concept mapping as a strategy for developing a knowledge management model for an urban technical institute's digital campus
AN  - 305512482
AB  - As educational institutions direct their attention to knowledge management practices, the processes and procedures for establishing and maintaining a knowledge base can seem an overwhelming and daunting task. To date, there has been insufficient research on academic processes for knowledge management planning and evaluation. The problem for this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of concept mapping as a strategy for developing a knowledge management model for an urban technical institute's digital campus. The literature revealed that at some point there is a need to collect and disperse knowledge within an organization. This study used a facilitated approach, based on observational data, to investigate the needs of primary users of knowledge, to understand the general importance of their needs, and to evaluate areas for future importance. This study's facilitated approach addressed several research objectives, including: investigating primary users' knowledge needs or wants and also investigating perceptions for evaluation criteria through a concept mapping research approach. By determining primary users' needs for the digital campus, the concept mapping method helped to define the digital campus environment. In addition, through the concept mapping procedure and data analysis stress values and pattern matching correlations it was determined that concept mapping is an effective tool to help develop a knowledge management model for an urban technical institute's digital campus.

T1  - “Because it's my work”: Primary students' learning in elementary science and technology
AN  - 305511135
AB  - This thesis investigated Grade 2 students' learning in the context of an Elementary Science and Technology Partnership curriculum unit about weather and designing and making books. Through observations, concept maps, interviews, and the collection of artifacts, the study examined students' learning in both science and technology, with a focus on learning that involved making connections and recognizing relationships between concepts and tasks.    The purpose of the research was threefold. First, the purpose was to study students' science and technology learning through (a) the qualitative changes in students' knowledge structures after completing a Big Task and related Support Tasks, and (b) how students use their knowledge gained from Support Tasks to complete a Big Task; second, to evaluate the EST unit “Wonders of Weather” as a vehicle for learning; third, to examine the use of concept maps with primary students as a qualitative research tool for studying their learning in science, especially the connections they make between concepts and tasks within a unit.    The findings of the study suggest four key points for research in elementary science and technology. First, students require mediation on the part of the teacher to make connections between concepts, skills, and tasks within a unit. Second, different assessment activities enable students to demonstrate different knowledge. Third, the combination of science and technology in the elementary curriculum has the potential to enhance the learning of both subjects because (a) collaboration seemed to naturally occur during technology activities and (b) using a technology task as a vehicle to demonstrate science knowledge appeared to enhance learning in both subjects. Fourth, concept mapping provides a rich source of data about the science learning of Grade 2 students.

T1  - A case study of science curriculum integration: Earth systems approach
AN  - 305502294
AB  - This case study investigates the Integrated Earth Systems Science (IESS) curriculum and instruction in a middle school. The purposes of this study are to: (1) explore one teacher's views on Earth Systems Education (ESE); (2) describe and document the characteristics of the IESS curriculum; (3) explore students' views about characteristics of the IESS curriculum and instruction; (4) investigate students' understandings related to ESE; and (5) compare IESS students' with a comparison group related to their self-reported knowledge, perceived significance, and primary information sources for Earth systems and environmental topics.    This study used a mixed methodology of qualitative and quantitative procedures. Data include observations; interviews with the teacher, Mr. Fox, and his eighth grade students; informal conversations; document analysis; field notes; and a student survey. The findings reveal that the curriculum emphasizes locally relevant topics, global concepts approached on a regional basis, and human interactions as a part of Earth systems.    Mr. Fox uses a constructivist approach to teach IESS. His primary teaching strategies are hands-on, activity-based, and project-based. Cooperative learning, concept mapping, and science field trips are integral components of his instruction. Student interviews indicate that they were positive about Mr. Fox's teaching strategies and assessment and found his strategies to beneficial to their understanding and connect classroom learning to the real world. However, their views on the use of concept maps for assessment were mixed.    The findings of the quantitative analysis indicate that self-reported knowledge and perceived significance mean scores for Mr. Fox's students were slightly higher than that of the comparison group for 13 Earth systems topics. Self-reported knowledge and significance scores related to global warming, pesticides in agriculture, and El Niño were significantly higher for Mr. Fox's students. Also, self-reported knowledge for concepts related to the value of Earth; interaction of water, land, air, and life; and cycles in nature were significantly higher for Mr. Fox's students. Additional findings indicate that a majority of Mr. Fox's students selected school as the primary information source for Earth systems and environmental topics, whereas the comparison students relied on both school and TV for their information.

T1  - The effect of a metacognitive intervention on approach to learning and self -regulation of learning in baccalaureate nursing students
AN  - 305500000
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a metacognitive intervention, specifically concept mapping, on approach to learning and self-regulation of learning in baccalaureate nursing students. Understanding how students approach and regulate learning may offer insight into developing teaching practices aimed at the improvement of student learning.    Approach to learning was measured by the revised Study Process Questionnaire-2 Factor (rSPQ-2F) (Biggs, Kember, & Leung, 2001). Self-regulation of learning was measured by the Strategic Flexibility Questionnaire (SFQ (Cantwell & Moore, 1996). Using a non-equivalent, untreated control group, pretest posttest design, the investigator examined the effect of concept mapping on these outcome variables in a convenience sample (N = 80) of baccalaureate nursing students over the course of a 15-week semester.    Significant group differences were found in the treatment group for the deep approach to learning [F (1) = 5.62, p = .02] and adaptive control beliefs [F (1) = 8.71,  p = .004] in that there was an increase in the deep approach to learning and adaptive control beliefs mean scores at the end of the semester. There were no significant differences between groups for the surface approach to learning, inflexible control beliefs, or irresolute control beliefs. Statistically significant pretest/posttest differences were found in the control group ( n = 43) in both deep approach to learning mean score (t = 2.13, df = 42, p = .04) and surface approach to learning mean score (t = −3.26, df = 42, p = .002). The deep approach to learning mean score decreased and the surface approach to learning mean score increased over the course of the semester.    The findings of this study provide empirical support for the value of concept mapping as a metacognitive intervention. Nurse educators are challenged to examine current pedagogy in relation to student learning. Recommendations for future research include the replication of this study using larger samples of students and conducting a longitudinal study to determine the ongoing and contextual approaches to learning over time. Further research is needed to determine the effect of traditional and non-traditional curricula on approach to learning and self-regulation of learning.

T1  - Developing a competency model-based maintenance manager qualification program utilizing concept mapping methodology
AN  - 305450196
AB  - The problem of this study was to develop a competency model based qualification program for maintenance managers at a Department of Energy facility using an Internet based concept mapping methodology. To accomplish this, 23 maintenance professionals from the project facility and industry viewed as being excellent in the maintenance field participated in this concept mapping exercise via the Internet. Due to workloads and time commitments, 14 maintenance professionals completed this study. Participants were prompted to list those behaviors that they have observed in maintenance managers that they saw as being excellent. A total of 140 statements were generated and edited down to 109 (taking into account redundant statements). From these statements cluster maps were developed and ranked according to importance and similarity. Eleven clusters maps were developed and grouped into five areas of competence; action management competencies, relationship competencies, future-building competencies, business competencies, and professional competencies. From these groups a qualification program plan was developed.

T1  - Enhancing managers' schemas regarding coaching skills using a computer conferencing training intervention
AN  - 305447353
AB  - The level of investment to meet the demand for “soft” skills within today's workforce has steadily increased. Yet there are concerns over both the effectiveness of training in this skill domain and the ability to provide cost-effective training access. The need is for greater precision in defining these skills, designing training to enhance them, and measuring the learning outcomes from such training.    A training course in Coaching Skills was designed using a proposed soft skills training framework, and then delivered to twenty-five practicing managers from six organizations using a computer conference. The cognitive schemas held by these managers regarding this skill domain, were captured using computer-constructed idiographic concept maps. Employing a replicated single subject design, the complexity of their coaching schemas and the similarity of these schemas to that of a domain expert, together with their level of self-efficacy in the skill of coaching, were measured pre- and post-training using quantitative methods. Their belief systems concerning coaching and their behavioral intent to enact the coaching skills were also explored using qualitative methods.    The participants' schema became significantly more similar to the expert schema following the completion of the course, and there was an interesting interaction between changes in schema complexity and similarity. Their level of self-efficacy in coaching also increased significantly. An analysis of the qualitative data indicated that the course had positively impacted their belief systems concerning coaching and that most of the managers had formed an intent to perform the skills back in the workplace.    The study findings indicate that soft skills training can produce positive learning outcomes when the domain and the underlying skill set are clearly defined together. The findings also reinforce past research suggesting that organizations must pay close attention to contextual factors as well as instructional factors if they are to positively influence behavioral intent. When delivering training in a soft skills domain, organizations should consider a medium such as computer conferencing which allows flexibility of participation and may represent a “safer” environment for training in sensitive subject areas. Finally, the study extends the use of concept mapping as a valuable research tool.

T1  - The development of critical thinking skills in associate degree nursing students
AN  - 305441034
AB  - This study examined critical thinking skills of associate degree student nurses from three different nursing programs, Schools A, B, and C that utilized the California Critical Thinking Skills Test as a program assessment tool. Results indicated some degree of improvement in scores from the three programs when comparing scores from beginning to end of each program. However, School C results reflected a significant difference (p < .05) in increase of critical thinking skills. In addition, a survey was sent to students and faculty in an attempt to identify instructional methodologies that may have enhanced critical thinking skills in students. Survey responses indicated that faculty and students perceived that a variety of active learning activities may have assisted students in developing critical thinking skills. Faculty noted that instructional methods which promote analytical thinking effectively in students were: Concept Maps, Case Studies, and Nursing Care Plans. School C faculty specified consistent use of these strategies which could account for the positive results in critical thinking ability of students in that school.

T1  - Media effects, public perceptions of science and authoritarian attitudes towards agricultural biotechnology decision-making
AN  - 304796954
AB  - This dissertation uses agricultural biotechnology as a case study with which to explore the extent to which American citizens maintain authoritarian attitudes towards science-related decision-making, and how media use might be related to such attitudes. It is argued in this study that authoritarian attitudes towards controversial science decision-making might be widespread among American citizens. In other words, contrary to views stressing the importance of public input for controversial scientific issues that have not only technical but also social implications, citizens might think that decision-making should in most cases be left to scientists and that public input is unnecessary. The research is largely exploratory, producing results useful to policy-makers and to researchers who are interested in mechanisms impacting public participation in policy-making for controversial science.    The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase used concept-mapping techniques to conceptualize various dimensions that lay individuals might associate with agricultural biotechnology. The second part of the study, based on a survey of New York State residents, tested a model linking media use and authoritarian attitudes, with knowledge, trust, and attitudes towards science and technology as potential mediating variables.    The results of the first phase of the study confirm that lay individuals often perceive issues in agricultural biotechnology to be as much political as scientific. Results of the quantitative analysis showed, however, that a large number of survey respondents expressed authoritarian attitudes towards agricultural biotechnology related decision-making. University scientists were perceived as the authority to trust for such decision-making, with little or no role for public input. Citizens may therefore often opt out of science-related policy-making. A context-based science authoritarianism, decreasing with levels of fear of science but increasing with levels of education, seems to be at play. Media use did impact authoritarian attitudes, although only attention to stories about agricultural biotechnology on television decreased levels of authoritarian attitudes, either directly or indirectly through knowledge, institutional trust and attitudes toward science and technology. This suggests that media alone may be unable to spark public participation in such an issue, if coverage does not increase significantly.

T1  - Evaluation of navigational styles in a constructivist hypermedia system.
AN  - 301581276
AB  - This project investigates the design, implementation and evaluation of a hypermedia authoring system, Camcon, which was predominantly based upon constructivism.  The feature set for Camcon included, concept mapping, hierarchical structures, and a new navigational device, partly based on Cognitive Flexibility Theory (CFT).  Formative evaluation occurred throughout the design cycle, using experts, novices and a specifically designed course module to inform the design of Camcon.  This phase of the formative evaluation in which Camcon was used in a real setting with real goals for the participants revealed some usability issues.  For example, of the several access structures provided, only concept mapping was utilised.  Also the participants showed a lack of understanding of the potential benefits of allowing students to author hypermedia and wanted to use if as a knowledge browsing device.  Design issues that arose at this stage were addressed as the course progressed.
  Next a summative evaluation was performed.  The format of the experiment was a pre-post test four group design, with the independent variable as the navigation method and the primary dependent variables were cognitive skill, epistemic beliefs, performance and navigational style.  Findings included that the cognitive skills that high achievers in the real world possess have very little impact on how learners use a hierarchically structured hypermedia system to gain declarative knowledge.  Navigational style (top-down linear, top-down non-linear, bottom-up linear, bottom-up non-linear) appears not to be influenced by the navigational access mechanisms that are provided in a hypermedia system or influence performance.  The evidence suggests that users have a preferred navigational style that they will try and use irrespective of the navigational mechanism that they have.  The non-linear access mechanisms (hierarchies and concept maps) exhibited the worst performance.  However, participants with non-linear navigational styles exhibited the best performance.  It was found that users with non-linear navigational styles or users of non-linear navigational devices most probably used the contents or home page to reorient themselves with respect to the structure of the knowledge domain.  The structure of individual nodes was also found to be important.

T1  - An investigation of the relationship between middle school science teachers' knowledge and beliefs regarding the coherence and connections among science concepts and their classroom practices
AN  - 288416335
AB  - In the last three decades, the United States has experienced many science education reform initiatives resulting in mixed success. Recently, research has found teachers' beliefs about their content and teaching have influence on what is taught. This investigation attempts to learn about the relationship between middle school teachers' beliefs and knowledge regarding the coherence and connectedness of science concepts and their classroom practice. This phenomenological investigation used an inductive qualitative research approach with multiple instruments and processes including; a survey, interviews, classroom observations, concept maps and classroom materials for data. The results suggest that middle school science teachers' ability to teach science in a connected and coherent fashion may be tied to their mental schema for organizing science ideas, curriculum materials, and their reflections on what they are teaching and why. Further research should help isolate and mitigate outside influences leading to a better understanding of teachers' beliefs about science.

T1  - Effect of concept mapping as a learning strategy on certificate practical nursing students' academic achievement and critical thinking development
AN  - 276651800
AB  - To be academically successful, nursing students need to know how to organize data and connect it to previously acquired knowledge. Concept mapping is an organizational strategy that may aid students in critical thinking and the ability to draw the necessary connections among the knowledge realms required to pass the required rigorous national licensing examination and to deliver safe and effective heath care. This quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design with pretest, posttest comparisons found that nursing students' academic achievement, as measured by performance on a multiple-choice examination, was significantly enhanced following instruction in concept mapping strategies. An absence of specific previous research related to the effectiveness of concept mapping on certificate practical nursing students' academic achievement and critical thinking abilities prompted this quantitative study that used a convenience sample (n = 29) recruited from a rural mid-Atlantic certificate practical nursing program. For this investigation concept mapping, an instructional strategy to visually represent and organize knowledge, was used to assist the treatment group participants (n = 15) in their development of conceptual frameworks and critical thinking abilities and served as the independent variable. The control group was not exposed to the concept mapping strategies during the 13-week, medical-surgical nursing course. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a neuroscience-nursing chapter was piloted in the spring of 2000 and served as the dependent variable in this study that was conducted in the spring of 2001. An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate indicated that after removing the effects of participants' prior knowledge the posttest performance of the treatment group was statistically significantly different (α = .05) than the non-treatment group. The findings confirm previous research and support the implementation of concept mapping as an instructional tool to improve students' academic success. In addition, 12 students in the treatment group independently created two concept maps. The first map was created prior to receiving instruction on a neuroscience unit of study. Following the unit of study, students in the treatment group reconstructed their first map. Two nurse educators independently scored the student's first and second maps. Critical thinking was measured based on Novak and Gowin's (1984) concept mapping scoring formula. Data analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the first and second concept maps. The findings indicate an increase in nursing students' critical thinking and support the implementation of concept mapping as an outcome measure of critical thinking in nursing education.

T1  - The use of concept mapping to evaluate the isomorphism of the hierarchical leisure constraint typology
AN  - 276289705
AB  - This study of leisure constraints used the Concept Mapping software developed by William Trochim (Trochim, 1993; Trochim, 1996) to develop a list of individual leisure constraints and categories of leisure constraints as identified and defined by participants.    Participants in this study were four focus groups each working independently. Group one consisted of outdoor recreation participants of a variety of ages who participated in a Wilderness First Responder course. Group two consisted of college students with a variety of interests and fields attending a large Southeastern university. Group three consisted of a variety of Community members who attended church in a college town built around a large Southeastern university. Group four consisted of adults retired from administrative positions living a southern community located in a recreation lake setting.    Participants were given information about the purpose of the study without an indication that items were to be grouped in later stage. To begin a definition of constraints was provided to participants. Each assembled focus group was asked, as a group, to generate a list of items that act as constraints and/or obstacles to leisure activities. The list of items that resulted front this brainstorming session was then copied onto separate sorting cards. Each participant got a complete list of the constraints and, on their own, soiled the items into categories that seemed appropriate to the individual participant. This entire process took approximately two hours for each group.    The Concept Mapping program built a map from the information contained in the matrix. With the information on each pair of items, the map was constructed using geographic distance to reflect the similarities or dissimilarities of items. The result was a visual map of conceptual relatedness with items of similar concept being close together on the map. This also resulted in having items that were conceptually unrelated, or opposite, separated by greater distances on the map.    The second part of the procedure was the Concept Mapping. While cluster analysis is generally used to group the participants by similarities, this study clustered the actual constraints generated by the participants. Information from the similarity matrix was used to determine what items were together in a cluster based on how participants divided the constraint items into groups. The maps generated try the program showed every constraint plotted as before, with the addition of boundaries surrounding constraints within a cluster. The program offered no objective means to establish the optimum number of clusters.    Objective methods for deciding on the appropriate number of clusters used measures of central tendency (means, medians, modes) of cluster number from group sorts. Subjective methods for deciding on the appropriate number of clusters followed the cluster divisions until substantive traditional concepts emerged. The resulting maps showed that none of the four focus groups followed traditional categorization of leisure constraints. Each focus group followed its own pattern of category division and identification grouping some traditional categories together while identifying finer distinctions of other traditional categories. Group one focused on developing finer categories of environmental conditions and social contact conditions. Group two focused on developing finer categories of personal abilities and inabilities. Group three focused on developing finer categories of psychological and social constraints. Group four focused on developing finer categories of administrative and organizational constraints.    These findings suggest that a typology based on constraint items may have less universal application and be less isomorphic that a typology based on participant interest areas and commonalities.

T1  - Formative use of select -and -fill -in concept maps in online instruction: Implications for students of different learning styles
AN  - 276268581
AB  - The purpose of this research was to investigate the formative use of Select and Fill-In (SAFI) maps in online instruction and the cognitive, metacognitive, and affective responses of students to their use. In particular, the implications of their use with students of different learning styles was considered. The research question investigated in this qualitative study was:  How do students of different learning styles respond to online instruction in which SAFI maps are utilized?    This question was explored by using an emergent, collective case study. Each case consisted of community college students who shared a dominant learning style and were enrolled in an online course in environmental studies. Cases in the study were determined using Kolb's Learning Style Inventory (LSI). Seven forms of data were collected during the study. During the first phase of data collection, dominant learning style and background information on student experience with concept mapping and online instruction was determined. In the second phase of data collection, participants completed SAFI maps and quiz items that corresponded to the content of the maps. Achievement data on the map activities and quiz and student responses to a post-SAFI survey and questionnaire were recorded to identify learner cognitive, metacognitive, and affective responses to the tasks.    Upon completion of data collection, cases were constructed and compared across learning styles. Cases are presented using the trends, across participants sharing the same dominant learning style, in achievement, behaviors and attitudes as seen in the evidence present in the data. Triangulation of multiple data sources increased reliability and validity, through cross-case analyses, and produced a thick description of the relationship between the cases for each learning style.    Evidence suggesting a cognitive response to the SAFI tasks was inconsistent across cases. However, learners with an affinity towards reflective learning activities demonstrated more positive metacognitive and affective responses to the SAFI tasks. This suggests that the contemplation and consideration of relationships expressed in the map requires learners, while completing the SAFI task, to compare their existing cognitive structure with an accepted structure and to reflect on the differences and similarities that may exist. Subsequently, the value of formative online SAFI map use for learners lies within the cognitive process of completing the tasks, not in the construction of an abstract cognitive structure reflecting an accepted structure and organization of concepts suggested by a completed map.

T1  - The development of a tool for selecting interdisciplinary learning materials
AN  - 276167981
AB  - Much of what is taught in school is determined by what is contained in the selected textbook. Considering the length of most textbooks, a teacher must choose a reasonable amount of content and ignore the rest. A multitude of additional learning materials are available to teachers. New curriculum materials are constantly being developed. As the teacher becomes aware of these materials, she/he makes curricular decisions concerning what to replace. Often, new curricular programs require systemic changes that have not yet occurred at the given school. Although complete implementation is preferable, it is not possible. When teachers are organized into interdisciplinary teams and are charged with the task of coordinating learning activities, curriculum selection difficulties are multiplied. Information Age technology can be utilized to address selection, modification, and implementation problems. This study presents a proof of concept model of a tool that facilitates interdisciplinary teacher teams as they select materials. The tool provides a structure for inclusion of an unlimited number of activities in a database. The structure of the tool utilizes a hierarchical decision tree format, concept mapping techniques, and expert system technology. The combination of these structures guides the teacher team through a series of levels. Each level offers several options. Once a learning activity is identified, the structure clearly illustrates connections to activities in other disciplines. The tool can be used to select individual learning activities from one discipline. It can also be used to select and organize a series of activities in multiple disciplines. It provides ample information to the user as needed. Expertise in teaming and curriculum selection processes is embedded in an expert system that can be consulted for help in making decisions. The proof of concept model provides the basis for extensive further development in the field of electronic curriculum selection.*    *This dissertation includes a CD that is compound (contains both a paper copy and CD as part of the dissertation). The CD requires the following applications: Windows 98 or higher; Internet Browser.

AB  - This thesis presents Comet-KO, a software tool for knowledge construction and organization, which takes its basis from instructivist and constructivist learning theories. Comet-KO aids users to collect, create and represent information, visualize relationships between concepts, and collaborate during the knowledge construction process. The representation of knowledge in Comet-KO is based on semantic networking techniques, which proved to be more powerful than conventional text based note-taking methodologies. In addition to formal semantic networking language, grouping and hypergraph drawing is also supported by Comet-KO, which brings a new perspective on visualization of knowledge construction.Alternate abstract:Bu tez temellerini instrüktivist ve konstrüktivist eğitim teorilerinden alan bir bilgi inşaa ve düzenleme olan Comet-KO`u sunmaktadır. Comet-KO, bilgi inşaası ve düzenlemesi sürecinde kullanıcıya bilgiyi toplama, yaratma ve sunmada, bu bilgileri ilşkilendirmede ve bu süreçte diğer kullanıcılarla etkileşmede yardımcı olmayı amaçlamaktadır. CometKO bilginin ifadesini yazıya dayalı klasik bilgi sunum methodları yerine, bilgi inşaasında bu tekniklerden çok daha üstün olan mantıksal ağ teknikleri ile yapmaktadır. Bilinen anlamsal ağ tekniklerini gruplama ve hipergraf çizim gücü ile geliştiren Comet-Ko, bilginin sunumu konusunda en kapsamlı anlamsal ağ geliştirme araclarından biri olmaya adaydır.

T1  - Ethnic identity by any other name…: A longitudinal analysis of the measurement of ethnic identity in an urban African American early adolescent sample
AN  - 304786018
AB  - This study investigated the structural properties of Phinney's (1992) Multigroup Ethnic Identity Measure (MEIM). Research conducted with adolescents has begun to examine the development of ethnic identity with adolescents and its potential relationship to psychological and behavioral outcomes. Phinney's (MEIM) has been utilized quite extensively in the area of adolescent development of ethnic identity. However, the MEIM has been utilized in various forms based on Phinney's (1992) original study and, more currently, factor analyses conducted by a variety of researchers (e.g., Arbono et al., 1999; Roberts et al., 1999). In addition, the MEIM in its original version does not measure theoretical (e.g., Marcia, 1966) components of ethnic identity, ethnic identity commitment and ethnic identity exploration.    The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to examine the ability to adequately measure the components of ethnic identity commitment and ethnic identity exploration via the MEIM based on expert reviewer's ratings of the MEIM items; and (2) to assess the structural properties of the MEIM as it was originally theoretically constructed by Phinney (1992) and as it is currently derived by Roberts et al. (1999). This study was conducted with data from a larger longitudinal study focusing on violence prevention. The data was based on responses from 294 students (125 males and 169 females) collected during the Fall of 1997 when the students were in seventh grade and in the Fall of 1998 when the students were in eighth grade. Concept mapping (Trochim, 1989) and confirmatory factor analyses via LISREL were conducted.    Concept mapping and confirmatory factor analyses demonstrated that the MEIM could be structured so as to measure the components of ethnic identity exploration and ethnic identity commitment. The two-factor model based on concept mapping procedures yielded similar factor structures to the factors derived by Roberts et al. (1999). Further analyses demonstrated that students could be categorized into identity statuses based on these two factors. Phinney's (1992) scales did not fit the data well within this sample.    A limitation of this study is that there were small individual samples of boys and girls and this could influence the results of confirmatory factor analyses. Additionally, this study dealt with urban African American early adolescents and cannot be generalized to other populations. Further research is needed to validate the two factors of ethnic identity commitment and ethnic identity exploration, specifically across various ethnic and age groups.

T1  - The effect of collaborative Web -based learning on high school students' attitudes, epistemological beliefs, and achievement
AN  - 304766928
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether combining collaborative learning strategies with instruction delivered using Web-based instruction produced academic, epistemological beliefs, and attitudinal gains based on a sample of high school female students in Korea.    Seventy tenth-grade female students participated in either the Web-based instruction (WBI) as the experimental group or the traditional instruction (TI) as the control group.    Statistical analyses were conducted on all of the measures collected: pre- and post-treatment scores of the attitude questionnaire (GRAQ), pre- and post-treatment scores for epistemological beliefs questionnaire (EBQ), pre- and post-treatment scores from the concept maps, post-treatment scores for the group concept-mapping from the WBI group and TI group, and interview data for six randomly selected students who experienced the Web-based learning strategies. The research hypothesis under eleven sub-questions were tested using t-tests and ANOVA, and interview data were used in an attempt to qualitatively clarify the quantitative findings of the total sample.    Results revealed that students who experienced WBI collaboratively showed a significant change in their attitude toward geography and in their epistemological beliefs after the instructional intervention, whereas students who experienced TI did not.    No statistical differences were found between methods of instruction on students' achievement. There was no statistically significant interaction between the method of instruction and students' learning level on the attitudinal change, epistemological beliefs, and students' achievement. The results of this study include several other important findings.

T1  - Worldview research with technology teachers
AN  - 304756367
AB  - Following a theoretical interpretation of worldview construction, two models are developed for understanding the context of technological education as a subject in the curriculum (the product paradigm) and the role of technological teachers in the secondary system (the technician paradigm). The role of cultural discourses around ‘fast-capitalism’ and postmodern ‘productivism’ on the development of teacher worldviews and the curriculum are discussed and critiqued from a critical-emancipatory knowledge perspective. The implications of both of these discourse streams on education for sustainability initiatives is also explored. A critical ‘ eco-technological’ model for technological education is proposed.    Employing both standard quantitative and innovative qualitative research methods, the worldviews of forty-eight secondary technological studies teachers are then presented. The worldview orientations of teachers are compared and contrasted along a number of dimensions related to ecological, social, and economic sustainability. The analytical framework for the qualitative research component included interviews and the development of a number of novel cultural worldview elicitation strategies using cartoons, images, concept mapping exercises and advertisement analysis. The worldviews of three teachers are explored in detail to demonstrate the efficacy of the intersubjective techniques and to support the conclusions regarding teacher worldviews and ‘sustainability thinking.’ Recommendations concerning the development of pre-service and in-service education of technological teachers with respect to sustainability are also explored.

T1  - Effects of concept mapping on learning anatomy and transfer of anatomy knowledge to kinesiology in health sciences students
AN  - 304727296
AB  - Purpose. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of concept mapping on academic achievement in anatomy and transfer of anatomy knowledge to kinesiology and to describe the participants' experience with this new study strategy. Methods. Thirty-eight junior physical therapy and occupational therapy students volunteered to participate in this study in the fall of 2000. Thirty students matriculated into the spring semester and completed the study. All participants signed informed consents. Participants were randomly assigned to a control group or concept mapping group. The concept mappers were instructed with concept mapping. Members of the concept mapping group were given a copy of Inspiration® software to install on their home computers for participating in the study. Control group members received $30 for participating in the study. Concept mappers were required to submit weekly concept maps for seven weeks in the fall semester. No concept maps were required the spring semester. All participants maintained a record of the time and method for studying for anatomy in the fall and kinesiology in the spring. Participants were tested prior to instruction and immediately after in anatomy on upper extremity topics. A Learning Styles and Study Strategy Inventory (LASSI) was also collected at the start of the study, at the start of the spring semester and upon completion of the study in the midterm of the spring semester. The participants were tested on kinesiology knowledge pre and post classroom instruction. Grades for the anatomy and kinesiology curses were also collected. Results. No statistically significant differences (p < .05) were found between groups on measures of anatomy knowledge, kinesiology knowledge or LASSI. Significant correlations (p < .01) were found between anatomy course grade average and kinesiology course grade average (r = .547). Qualitative findings revealed differences in acceptance of concept mapping as a new strategy depending on the participants' overall metacognitive approach to learning.  Conclusions. Concept mapping in anatomy did not improve scores of academic performance for anatomy or kinesiology. However, the intent of the student to use the concept mapping strategy as a rote learning method may have influenced the results. The effectiveness of concept mapping as a learning strategy may depend on metacognitive level of the student using the technique.

T1  - Investigation of student use of Web -based tutorial materials and understanding of chemistry concepts
AN  - 304726943
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate students' use of Web-based tutorial materials in general chemistry and these students' understanding of chemistry concepts. The Visualization and Problem Solving Web Site includes tutorial materials for several visual chemistry topics such as VSEPR and coordination chemistry. Students generally valued the web site because of the representations and visualizations it provided, the materials and information available on the web site, and because they felt that they needed help with chemistry. Many students who did not use the web site felt that they did not need help with chemistry and thus did not need this additional source of help. Both web site users and nonusers were generally positive about using the web to learn chemistry. Motivation was also a factor in student decisions to use or not use the materials on the web. To gauge students' understanding of chemistry concepts, students were asked questions about coordination chemistry and drew concept maps during the interviews. Web site users made more incorrect statements during the discussion of coordination chemistry questions, but the student concept maps did not show a great difference in terms of percentages of correct and incorrect links.

T1  - Enriching pedagogical content knowledge of prospective chemistry teachers: How can the science methods course help?
AN  - 304726843
AB  - This study investigates the perspectives of prospective chemistry teachers regarding activities and interactions important toward enriching pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) during a secondary physical science methods course. Case study methodology was used for four prospective chemistry teachers to investigate the activities and interactions involved in the enrichment of PCK. Each subject drew three concept maps, one representing the subject's content knowledge of a particular topic, another outlining the subject's intended teaching method for the topic, and the third indicating the subject's concerns with regards to teaching the topic. The subjects were then interviewed to determine the subject's prior knowledge structure regarding the topic. Throughout the semester, subjects participated in the normal activities of the methods course, including performing three microteaching episodes. Following each episode, subjects reviewed and made changes on the previously drawn maps. Changes were the subject of probing questions asked during subsequent interviews. Additionally, written assignments for each participant and researcher observations were collected to provide rich detail about the experiences of each subject.    The findings suggest that PCK results from the integration of many possible combinations of teacher knowledge bases. Activities suggested as enriching PCK were varied, however, activities associated with microteaching episodes focused participants on the integration of contextual and curricular knowledge into PCK. Therefore, it was speculated that activities provide a focus to the construction of PCK. This focus was also shown to be dependent on participant response to the activity. Participants also suggested that interpersonal and intrapersonal interactions were important for effective PCK enrichment. Interpersonal interactions provide an impetus toward PCK enrichment, while intrapersonal interactions offered the personal rationale for PCK enrichment.

T1  - Benchmarking academic key performance indicators for higher education
AN  - 304703455
AB  - This study focused on identifying and examining academic performance indicators to improve the teaching and learning process in higher education. The goal of the study was to determine what key performance indicators would position academic programs in addressing future challenges and opportunities facing higher education. The study piloted the health science division at Rochester Community and Technical College, which included fifteen career and technical programs and three general science areas.    The research methodology used in this study focused on a four phase benchmarking methodology that involved examining and understanding internal processes and seeking out exemplary higher education institutions that modeled a quality continuous improvement approach.    The primary source of data for this study involved three steps (1) development of a rubric assessment framework by which academic programs self-assessed themselves to determine if their program was meeting the mission and identified academic performance indicators, (2) analysis of WebGrid II concept maps that integrated multiple performance indicators into a single visual, and (3) identification of best practice examples to learn innovative continuous quality improvement approaches.    The findings of the study suggested that quality approaches that focus on key performance indicators and benchmarking strategies offer opportunities to determine how educational institutions can improve and grow in the future. It also suggested that engagement of faculty in activities that help define and assess performance indicators can create a better understanding and enhance their ability to make systemic changes.

T1  - Rebalancing goals in the National Park Service: Achieving reform in a federal agency
AN  - 304691009
AB  - The Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) is only the latest of many opportunities to rebalance achievement of the goals in the National Park Service (NPS) Organic Act of 1916. Perceptions of demographically identified employees represent a tool that might have increased the chances of success especially if strategies for change were integrated into the budget process. Since the founding of the NPS, in 1916, the Service has had the dual tasks of “conserving” and “providing for the enjoyment” of each park's resources.    Many before have concluded that the NPS was not accomplishing it's mandate of “preservation” of its' resources. Now as before such conclusions have confused and angered many people inside and outside the NPS. Perceptions reflect the culture of an organization and provide clues to significant obstacles to change. This research provides some answers and some suggestions to potential reformers as to the present perceptions of the NPS by strategic surveying of the permanent employees of the Midwest Region.    A survey instrument was derived, using Concept Mapping. The survey demographically identified personnel, determined their priority perceptions about “use”, “conservation”, and gauged the effectiveness of GPRA in attaining the NPS's mandates.    The results point out that the Superintendents of the Midwest Region do prioritize “conservation” and “use” as their highest priority. It was, however, found that many of the other permanent employees do not. Perceptions about the balance of the goals of “use” and “conservation” were shown not to be consistently in alignment between managers and different categories of permanent employees.    In every park that was surveyed, strategic planning that was required by GPRA was consuming a great deal of the park staff's time and energy. There was almost universal frustration, however, with the lack of coordination of strategic planning and the budget process.    The use of Concept Mapping in this research graphically shows areas of personnel priority disconnect. Further use of the Student t-Test brought areas of disconnects into priority focus.

T1  - Case studies of middle school students' alternative conceptions and conceptual changes concerning the theory of plate tectonics
AN  - 304688702
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the alternative conceptions three students have about plate tectonics and to discover how these conceptions change during instruction. I selected three seventh grade students to participate in this multiple case study. Data were collected and analyzed from concept maps, interviews, and classroom artifacts. Three major categories or themes of alternative conceptions kept reoccurring in the data as a result of within- and cross-case analyses: Visualizing Plate Tectonics, Recreating Theories, and Coping With Dissonance. I also found reoccurring patterns of conceptual changes made by the students concerning plate motions, earthquakes, volcanoes, and mountains.    This study confirmed the existing research which states that students come to the classroom with ideas about science which they have constructed from their personal experiences and which have shaped their thinking of the world. A student's pre-existing conception may not be aligned with the scientific community.    This study clearly authenticated that presenting information in different formats such as models, drawings, graphic organizers, and videos helped students better visualize the abstract concepts of plate tectonics. As the students proceeded through the activities, they recognized that it was their responsibility to reconstruct their existing ideas.    This study vividly indicated that with careful instruction based on the constructs of the conceptual change model, the participants were able to cope with the dissonance and to recreate new conceptions of plate motions, earthquakes, mountains, and volcanoes. Providing students with an ample number of hands-on experiences helped them to construct intelligible, plausible, and fruitful knowledge which is very similar to scientific views on the topic.    The research has shown that students' conceptions are important and should be considered by teachers even though their concepts may not parallel those of scientists. Further research stemming from the results of this study should focus on alternative conceptions and conceptual changes of plate tectonics.

T1  - The professionalization of logistics: A management specialty to meet 21st century challenges
AN  - 252131380
AB  - A review of current management literature reveals the management skills and perspective needed to meet the challenges anticipated in the 21st Century include a cross-functional, multidimensional, life cycle approach emphasizing full integration of all enterprise infrastructure elements—technology, processes, and people. Since the early 1900s, the evolution of professional management specialty disciplines has been responsive to emerging practice needs. The existing management specialty discipline, which can address the identified 21st Century needs, is logistics—not the narrow transportation and distribution perspective, but a comprehensive logistics perspective. The Research Question investigated in this dissertation was “Has logistics practice evolved sufficiently to be recognized as a professional management specialty?”. The theoretical basis for this research was the process for evolution from technical occupation to profession, described by Wilensky (1964) based on his historical examination of 18 occupations, which evolved to professions.    The research design for this study was an exploratory, empirical, non-experimental, cross-sectional, qualitative assessment, case study. Data collection consisted primarily of ex post facto documents review in two stages. In the first stage, the literature relating to professions and the professionalization process was reviewed to produce a characteristics profile of a profession. In stage two, 1,083 documents describing logistics practice and theory were analyzed to produce a descriptive profile of logistics practice and theory. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) techniques, specifically a modified Concept Mapping procedure with Pattern Matching using a 2-point qualitative scale were used to assess the current status of Logistics as a profession. The results indicated a “qualified yes” answer to the research question, since there was support for all seven attitudinal and all 12 structural antecedent dimensions identified. Of significance to logistics and management practitioners and to researchers in both fields, findings indicate a need to increase activities leading to professional self-regulation, logistics theory development, and educational activities for continued technical and managerial skill sets development. This study has extended the research of professionalization into the area of cross-functional, organizational boundary spanning, and technical management specialties.

T1  - Physics experiences and calculus: How students use physics to construct meaningful conceptualizations of calculus concepts in an interdisciplinary calculus /physics course
AN  - 251726097
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the manner by which students enrolled in an integrated Calculus/Physics course use their understanding of physics to inform their conceptualizations of calculus concepts. This study utilized a multiple case study design with analysis by and across cases. The cases represent eight first year students in the College of Engineering and Physical Sciences at the University of New Hampshire who enrolled in an integrated calculus/physics program. Data was gathered in a three-part process: (1) Semi-structured task-based interviews, (2) Participant-observation in the calculus/physics course, and (3) Obtaining copies of students' in-class notes, in-class activities, homework assignments, and examinations.    A series of tasks designed to elicit information about students' conceptualizations of average rate of change, derivative, integral, and the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus were developed and pilot-tested by the researcher. To further corroborate the information gathered through the interview tasks, the students' examination, homework assignments, and in-class activities were reviewed. A description of each students' concept image was developed by analyzing the students' responses to interview tasks and triangulated with student-produced concept maps, observation of students in class, and students' homework, performance on examinations, and class work. A second layer of analysis resulted in the emergence of a classification scheme that describes how the students use physics to inform their conceptualization of calculus concepts, if at all. Finally, by searching individual student descriptions for patterns and similarities, a general description for the interactions between concept image and classification was proposed.    The results from this research investigation suggest that students frequently use physics concepts to construct meaningful conceptualizations of average rate of change. However, the students less frequently draw upon physics concepts to inform their conceptualizations of derivative and integral. The results from this research investigation also suggest that the students participating in this study possess richer conceptualizations of calculus concepts that what has previously been reported in the literature.    Hypotheses and questions for further investigation of students' uses of physics concepts to inform their conceptualizations of calculus concepts are generated. Implications for teaching practice and curriculum development are suggested and discussed.

T1  - Using concept mapping as an interactive learning tool in Web -based distance education
AN  - 250789072
AB  - Issues and trends discussed in literature across a number of disciplines including distance education, instructional design science, sociology, human factors engineering, visual communications, and computer and information science indicated that there is a critical need for web-based distance education courseware to be theoretically grounded and interactive. A thorough search for web-friendly, interactive, instructional techniques highlighted concept mapping as a possible solution. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to explore the integration of concept mapping into web-based distance education courseware as a tool to increase interactivity and learning outcomes. This study used a blend of qualitative methods that included document analysis, concept mapping and interviewing in order to probe an authentic context within a unique case orientation. Further, this study made use of data triangulation and investigator triangulation in order establish the credibility of the findings. The data in this study indicated that concept mapping may be utilized successfully within web-based distance education courseware as a tool to increase interactivity and learning outcomes.

T1  - A case study of online collaborative inquiry in an elementary classroom
AN  - 250231214
AB  - This study explores the impact of online collaborative inquiry on a fifth grade classroom utilizing a case study method with multiple measures. It brings together literature surrounding inquiry-based teaching with strategies for the effective implementation of the Internet. The Draw-a-Scientist Test, TOSRA, CLI, concept maps, and interviews were used to collect data.    Students were involved in Following Fall, an online collaborative project sponsored by the School Nature Area Project of St. Olaf College. Through Following Fall, the classroom studied autumnal seasonal change by determining the percentage of a schoolyard trees progression of color change, average weekly temperature, and length of daylight. Data was collected and posted online. A collaborative online data table allowed students to compare local data with schools representing geographically diverse locations. In cooperative groups, students designed their own inquiry investigations using data they could collect in their schoolyard around the topic of autumnal seasonal change. As a culminating project, each group created a website to display the artifacts of their learning.    Students in this case study were clearly motivated by both the inquiry nature of the investigation and the presence of an online Following Fall learning community. Identifying the investigation as their own making provided greater impetus to following the investigation through to a satisfactory conclusion. Student perceptions of science and the work scientists do were positively influenced by first hand participation in activities they viewed as the work of science. Students were able to identify themselves in the role of scientists, expanding the role of science in their lives, and significantly reducing the number of common stereotypes appearing on the Draw-a-Scientist test.    Lost learning opportunities suffered as a result of the lack of attention given to engaging students with explicit, physical connections with the online collaborative community underscores the importance of creating a face on other schools and their data. Technology devoid of a carefully articulated strategy for employment is not sufficient to motivate and positively impact the majority of students. A carefully and intentionally structured learning environment must be in place to realize the benefits of online-supported inquiry.

T1  - Constructivism and supporting environments: Exploring instructional salience in preservice teacher education
AN  - 230801193
AB  - Understanding what teacher candidates learn given differing instructional environments is of paramount concern, given the vast number of claims about the superiority of various environments within the teacher education literature. Researchers embrace a wide assortment of approaches because they are thought to bring about change in candidates' conceptions of teaching and learning. Few approaches, however, have sufficient empirical evidence to support their use.    Although useful, the pedagogical recommendations that emanate from constructivist theories are still too broad for immediate application in teacher education. Constructivism as a learning theory lacks corresponding theories of instruction that describe optimal learning environments for teacher candidates. Until teacher educators know more concerning what candidates find salient about and what they learn in various instructional environments, constructivism will remain at best a learning theory with limited ability to inform teacher education.    The purpose of this study was to inform constructivism by investigating it application to instruction within the domain of teacher education. Specifically, the aim of this study was to determine the aspects of instruction that were salient for teacher candidates and why these influenced what they learned. The study took place in a teaching methods course for 16 family and consumer sciences education majors. A short instructional episode was the focus of this detailed, fine-grained study. Data were gathered from repeated and multiple measures, including a demographic questionnaire, concept mapping, a questionnaire accompanying the post-mapping, stimulated recall interview, a short answer assessment, interview, a videotape, and field notes.    Findings suggested that candidates' knowledge construction was greatly aided by six strategies including: candidates experienced a way to report back to the class after experiencing a small group teaching method, candidates experienced a small group method, the instructor used a case, instructor examples, discussion, and instructor explanations. Candidates' knowledge construction focused primarily on how to perform small group methods and the reasons given by the instructor for learning various concepts. Candidates' beliefs appeared to be good predictors of those candidates who learned the most and the least. Further, instructional time was related to both those strategies that were of greatest salience for candidates and the specific concepts learned.

T1  - Teaching kids how to learn: Best practices when using difficult text in biology
AN  - 230494206
AB  - This thesis examines a number of strategies that can be implemented in a Biology class when using difficult text. Concept maps, study guides and mnemonic devices are described in some depth, as are the researcher's experiences using them. Understanding of concepts is essential for acquiring knowledge in content areas. Biology is especially difficult due to inconsiderate text that assumes prior knowledge and high reading skills. This paper focuses on techniques that can facilitate learning for students with various learning styles and levels when learning science.

T1  - Impact of concept-mapping upon meaningful learning and metacognition among foundation-level associate-degree nursing students
AN  - 304676328
AB  - The purpose of this study was: to compare the effects of a brain-based learning and study strategy, concept-mapping; and a traditional learning and study strategy, outlining, on the self-reported measures of meaningful learning and metacognition among foundation-level associate-degree nursing students. The Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI), developed by Weinstein, Palmer, and Schulte (1987), was used as the instrument to measure the designated meaningful learning subscales of Information Processing, Selecting Main Ideas, and Study Aids as well as the designated metacognition subscales of Attitude, Time Management, Motivation, Anxiety, Concentration, Self-Testing and Test-Taking Strategies. Ausubel's Assimilation Theory (1963) was the conceptual framework guiding this study. The sample consisted of 57 foundation-level, associate-degree nursing students from a large Mid-western technical college.    An untreated control group with a pretest and posttest was the quasi-experimental research design used to study the following hypothesis:   Foundation-level, associate-degree nursing students who utilize a brain-based study strategy over a 4-week period will score higher on measures of meaningful learning and metacognition than foundation-level, associate-degree nursing students who utilize a non brain-based, traditional study strategy over a 4-week period.   Demographic, academic, and data on study attributes were obtained through a questionnaire before the intervention. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, and means, were used to describe the sample. An Independent-Samples t-test was used to compare the magnitude of change from pretest to posttest in both groups with the alpha level set at .05. The analyses revealed statistically significant increases among the intervention group in meaningful learning measures of Information Processing, Selecting Main Ideas, and Study Aids as well as in metacognition measures of Attitude, Motivation, and Self-Testing. Crombach's Alpha was used to verify the internal consistency reliability of the LASSI (Weinstein et. al., 1987). Alpha coefficients obtained from this sample were within the acceptable range and comparable with those found in the literature. The results of this study have important implications for nursing and other areas of adult education. The most important ramification of the findings is that concept-mapping effectively promotes meaningful learning and metacognition, as evidenced through self-reported increases in designated LASSI (Weinstein et. al., 1987). subscales.

T1  - Exploring multiple intelligences theory in the context of science education: An action research approach
AN  - 304663973
AB  - Since the publication of Frames of Mind: The Theory in Practice, multiple intelligences, theory (Gardner, 1983) has been used by practitioners in a variety of ways to make teaching and learning more meaningful. However, little attention has been focused on exploring the potential of the theory for science teaching and learning. Consequently, this research study was designed to: (1) explore Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences (1983) and its merit for making science teaching and learning more meaningful; (2) provide a forum for teachers to engage in critical self-reflection about their theory and practice in science education; (3) study the process of action research in the context of science education; and (4) describe the effectiveness of collaborative action research as a framework for teacher development and curriculum development.    The study reports on the experiences of four teachers (two elementary teachers, one junior high teacher, and one high school teacher) and myself, a university researcher-facilitator, as we participated in a collaborative action research project. The action research group held weekly meetings over a five-month period (January–May, 1999). The inquiry was a qualitative case study (Stake, 1994) that aimed to understand the perspectives of those directly involved. This was achieved by using multiple methods to collect data: audiotaped action research meetings, fieldnotes, semi-structured interviews, journal writing, and concept mapping. All data were analysed on an ongoing basis.    Many positive outcomes resulted from the study in areas such as curriculum development, teacher development, and student learning in science. Through the process of action research, research participants became more reflective about their practice and thus, enhanced their pedagogical content knowledge (Shulman, 1987) in science. Students became more engaged in learning science, gained a greater understanding of how they learn, and experienced a science curriculum that was more relevant and personalized. In addition, the action research process provided a feasible and effective forum for both curriculum development and professional development.

T1  - Applying patterns to hypermedia instructional design (APHID)
AN  - 304661126
AB  - This research addresses the issue of automatically generating instructional hypermedia documents (in the form of web sites). Our hypothesis is that, for certain types of hypermedia, an automated approach can produce satisfactory hypermedia applications more efficiently than humans are able to create them. We propose a method (APHID) that guides a hypermedia creator through the design process and partially automates the creation of hypermedia applications. Our method uses concept maps and instructional design patterns, as well as the more common domain and presentation models, to support partial automation for creating instructional hypermedia.    Most hypermedia application developers follow basic graphical design principles, but few commonly accepted principles exist for the structuring of hypermedia applications. The design of instructional hypermedia imposes the additional requirement that the designer be expert both in hypermedia design and in instructional design. APHID supports designers through the use of patterns to describe and clarify design concepts for both instructional design and interface design.    This thesis describes the design and development of the APHID approach and a prototype software tool that supports the development of instructional hypermedia using the APHID approach. The thesis also presents a study in which web sites created with APHID are compared (by an independent evaluator) to web sites created by instructional technologists. The study shows that good instructional web sites can be generated semi-automatically with less expenditure of time on the part of the instructional designer.

T1  - Unifying concepts in the high school biology curriculum, one or many: An investigation of rural, suburban, and urban schools
AN  - 304644503
AB  - Nine high school biology teachers from rural, suburban, and urban school settings, were interviewed about what idea, topic, or concept, if any, they use to unify their high school biology curriculum. Professional scientists and educational organizations have proposed that high school biology teachers use “biological evolution” as a unifying concept of their curriculum. Interviews, concept maps, and classroom syllabi and outlines were provided as data for these nine case studies.    Each teacher was asked what topics were included in their curriculum to determine if a wide enough content was taught to warrant unification. The teachers' responses were compared to content and concepts listed in the National Science Content Standards, the Washington State Essential Academic Learning Requirements for Science, and a paper (Hurd, Bybee, Kahle, and Yager, 1980) that proposed what and how topics should be taught in the high school biology class by the year 2000. The nine teachers were asked to draw a concept map showing how these topics were interrelated and what concept, if any, “unified” them. A unifying concept is defined as a concept introduced early in the year and referred back to whenever new topics are introduced illustrating how the new topic is related to the previous ones through this unifying concept. Seven of the nine teachers did use at least one unifying concept. Two use evolution or natural selection, two use the web of life, two use the characteristics of life, and one uses scientific inquiry. The data collected in this study indicate high school teachers use these concepts such as the web of life and the characteristics of life because they believe they are easily understood by their students and less controversial than the theory of evolution.    This study also presents evidence that school setting has minimal influence on what concept teachers use to unify their curriculum and that teachers have a significant amount of academic freedom to choose what they want to teach and how they want to teach it. The data suggests that teachers choose their unifying concept based on their personal beliefs of what their students will accept and on their past interactions with parents, students, and administrators when various unifying concepts were used.

T1  - Design research for the Living Curriculum: The design of case-based performance support for teacher learning
AN  - 304630250
AB  - The Living Curriculum (LC) is a case-based on-line performance support tool for teachers learning to implement technology-rich project-based science units. It embeds cases directly into project-based science (PBS) curricula where LC users can draw on the experience of others to inform their own teaching. This dissertation focuses on research conducted to support the design of the LC.    Research was guided by three questions: (1) What content should LC cases address? (2) How should that content be organized? and (3) How should cases be represented in the system? The content question involves understanding the domain well enough to determine what content should be included in the system. The indexing question involves understanding how to organize that content. Finally, the representation question involves the design of representations that communicate the intended point.    To respond to the content question two case studies were conducted in the classrooms of teachers who were implementing a PBS unit. The case studies included daily videotaping of classroom teaching and learning as well as weekly reflective interviews with the teachers. The case studies produced both a theory to guide the development of content for the LC and the media from which that content was developed.    At the heart of the indexing question lies the realization that users approach content with reference to their own knowledge and experience. As a result indexing requires the development of user models that inform the likely ways that users will expect to interact with the system. A concept mapping method was used to develop a user model that provides insight into the ways that potential LC users might like to interact with the system. Based on the results three separate indices were developed (task, narrative, and question-based indexing) to organize the LC.    Finally, the representation question was addressed through iterative design and user testing of an LC prototype.    This dissertation reports on the results of the case studies and concept mapping exercise and draws on those results to inform the design of the Living Curriculum. Next it reports on user testing and iterative design. Finally it summarizes key findings, remaining challenges, and future research.

T1  - A narrative study of selected introductory college biology students' struggles to gain an understanding of scale and measurement
AN  - 304628828
AB  - Case studies, developed with criteria from Yin's Case Study Research: Design and Methods (1994), probed single mental constructs of four introductory college biology students who were recent high school graduates. Data sources included autobiographical essays, interviews, coconstructed concept maps (Wandersee & Abrams, 1993), a videotape questionnaire, and graphics. A multisensory microscopy experiment provided the setting for the construction of shared meanings by the participants. Concept maps were used then to explore the existing cognitive framework of the participants. This research affirmed the value of supporting graphic organizers for understanding science (Good & Berger, 1998; Hyerle, 1996; Trowbridge & Wandersee, 1998).    Ausubelian cognitive learning theory (Ausubel, Novak, and Hanesian, 1978) was the theoretical foundation for this research. The heuristic device of concept mapping was used as a method to aid the student in externalizing and understanding the development and integration of relevant concepts. Ausubel (1968), Novak and Gowin (1984) recognize the positive results of knowledge construction from laboratory experiences. Expanding the student's immediate knowledge of microscopy with instruction by the researcher helped students connect scale relationships with microscopy.    Results of this study suggest (a) that there are anticipatable and addressable gaps in their knowledge of size, scale, measurement, and micrometry that introductory college biology students bring to the science laboratory, and (b) that these gaps and misunderstandings will otherwise impede their learning from microscopy-based laboratory experiences and frustrate their ability to measure and to grasp the relative size of microstructures and microorganisms meaningfully. Results also suggest that, the MicroMeasure™ grid system in particular may offer a new and more effective way to help students learn to interpret the magnification powers used in presenting the objects pictured in the commonplace electron micrograph images appearing so frequently on the pages of today's biology textbooks. A better introduction to and progressive articulation of the precursor concepts needed to understand microscopic images during the K–12 school experience apparently would smooth the transition from high school to college biology laboratory learning from microscopes and microscopic images.

T1  - Concept mapping and science achievement of middle -grade students
AN  - 304628538
AB  - This study was designed to examine the effects of concept mapping on science achievement of middle grade science students. Concept mapping is a graphic display of concepts and the relationships or links among them. A concept map represents the students' understanding of a body of knowledge.    The subjects were one hundred eighty-two eighth grade students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes at Bowling Green Junior High School. Students were homogeneously grouped by above average and average ability levels. Therefore, the ability level variable was examined as a possible effect. Students were divided into four treatment groups (two per ability level) and four control groups (two per ability level). Two teachers were involved in teaching a unit on weather for nine weeks. The treatment groups constructed concept maps, while the control groups did not. Two testing instruments (a conventional weather test and six performance assessment items) were used to measure achievement.    For this sample of students, analyses of covariance indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A weak but statistically students measured by combined performance assessment items.    Similar to the literature reviewed, the results of this research are somewhat mixed. The results suggest that the effect of concept mapping on science achievement is not clear and science educators should be cautious as to its practical use in the classroom. Furthermore, the results suggest that researchers should continue to seek more data to either support or reject the effectiveness of concept mapping.

T1  - Facilitating synthesis and advancing methodological development in strategic planning
AN  - 304624809
AB  - Theory in the field of strategic management has grown tremendously over the last 40 years without a comparable evolution in strategic planning methodologies. Tools and frameworks for conducting strategic planning are grossly inefficient in enabling organizations to envision a desirable future state and chart a course toward achieving organizational goals. Several prominent authors in the field have alluded to the idea that what is required are tools and methods that enable ‘synthesis’ of the complex set of ideas involved in strategy formulation. This investigation considers one promising candidate methodology, the Concept System, in detail, describes how it extends considerably beyond traditional strategic planning methods, shows how it addresses specific issues in the major schools of thought in the literature, describes in detail its use in a real-world strategic planning context, and compares how well it functioned in comparison with a traditional, rational-analytic strategic planning approach. The Concept System is a group decision-making tool that organizes brainstormed statements and ideas from a variety of stakeholders into a series of images called Concept Maps. These maps are interpreted by the group and the final output becomes a framework for developing a comprehensive strategic plan. This approach has the potential to enable integration and, especially synthesis, to occur in strategic planning. As such, the Concept System may provide an answer to Mintzberg et al.'s call for methods that constitute “good practice, not neat theory” and to chart a course for renewed interest in investigating new strategic planning methods to encourage the evolution of theory and practice in the field of strategic management.

T1  - Toward a theory of sexual harassment: Giving voice to women students' experiences
AN  - 304615277
AB  - A qualitative study was conducted of the ways in which women students experienced the ramifications of sexual harassment incidents that occurred during the women's education. The study's scope encompassed both participants' lived experiences of sexual harassment as well as subsequent personal and career-related consequences. Grounded theory methods were used to discover an inductively derived theory that was grounded directly in participants' experiences. Unstructured interviews were conducted with 29 current and former women students who self-identified as having been targets of sexual harassment in academia. Participants represented diversity in terms of their range of sexual harassment experiences and their culture/ethnicity, sexual orientation, age, relational status, and academic standing.    A theoretical model of women students' purposeful attempts to navigate disruption caused by sexual harassment and its repercussions was constructed and illustrated via a concept map. “Navigating disruption” was discovered to be the theory's core category. Six other major categories that related to the core category were also discovered including (1) sexual harassment and other inappropriate harasser behaviors, (2) context of harasser behaviors and subsequent repercussions/reactions of others, (3) degree of disruption, (4) repercussions/reactions of others, (5) women's range of vision, and (6) consequences. Logic diagrams in the form of two 2 x 2 typologies were used to further describe the theory with regard to the processes by which the participants perceived, made sense of, and responded to the disruption they were experiencing. The theory conveyed process by describing the ways in which women's experiences and perceptions evolved over time, as conditions changed, and with new personal and career-related experiences. Analysis of the data revealed great variation in participants' navigational strategies depending upon a variety of identified factors. The findings advance knowledge about women students' lived experiences of the ramifications of sexual harassment in several ways. The theory provides a new lens for understanding why women utilize a range of navigational strategies. It also fits within the rubric of career development theories and provides a framework within which prior sexual harassment research and future studies may be placed. A discussion is provided of the practical implications of the findings for education, policy, and clinical practice.

T1  - The critical thinking curriculum model
AN  - 304615082
AB  - The Critical Thinking Curriculum Model (CTCM) utilizes a multidisciplinary approach that integrates effective learning and teaching practices with computer technology. The model is designed to be flexible within a curriculum, an example for teachers to follow, where they can plug in their own critical issue. This process engages students in collaborative research that can be shared in the classroom, across the country or around the globe. The CTCM features open-ended and collaborative activities that deal with current, real world issues which leaders are attempting to solve. As implemented in the Critical Issues Forum (CIF), an educational program administered by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), the CTCM encompasses the political, social/cultural, economic, and scientific realms in the context of a current global issue. In this way, students realize the importance of their schooling by applying their efforts to an endeavor that ultimately will affect their future.    This study measures student attitudes toward science and technology and the changes that result from immersion in the CTCM. It also assesses the differences in student learning in science content and problem solving for students involved in the CTCM.    A sample of 24 students participated in classrooms at two separate high schools in New Mexico. The evaluation results were analyzed using SPSS in a MANOVA format in order to determine the significance of the between and within-subjects effects. A comparison ANOVA was done for each two-way MANOVA to see if the comparison groups were equal. Significant findings were validated using the Scheffé test in a Post Hoc analysis. Demographic information for the sample population was recorded and tracked, including self-assessments of computer use and availability. Overall, the results indicated that the CTCM did help to increase science content understanding and problem-solving skills for students, thereby positively effecting critical thinking. No matter if the students liked science or not, enjoyed computers or not, the CTCM approach helped to increase science content understanding and problem-solving skills. The CTCM clearly provides an educational framework that can aid all students in the development of critical thinking skills.

T1  - The ADAGE Approach to Mathematics and the Concept of Function
AN  - 304613708
AB  - This study examined a reform pre-calculus course and its innovative approach to teaching mathematics. The course, Interdisciplinary Math and Science, was observed for a year and its learning environment and unique ADAGE (activity, data, analysis, generalizations, extensions) approach to teaching mathematics were described and evaluated. The evaluation made use of concept maps and traditional assessment instruments to compare student understanding of the concept of function. Thirteen students from the reform class and 13 students from traditional pre-calculus sections were asked to construct concept maps for the concept of function. A traditional assessment on function procedures and properties was also administered to both groups of students. The results indicated that students instructed under the ADAGE approach developed a richer conceptual understanding of function than their peers from a traditional pre-calculus classroom. Additionally, the ADAGE students performed as well on procedural function tasks as the pre-calculus students and demonstrated significant improvement in their personal math attitude and aptitude.

T1  - Relationship of students' conceptual representations and problem -solving abilities in acid -base chemistry
AN  - 304612871
AB  - This study explored the relationship between secondary chemistry students' conceptual representations of acid-base chemistry, as shown in student-constructed concept maps, and their ability to solve acid-base problems, represented by their score on an 18-item paper and pencil test, the Acid-Base Concept Assessment (ABCA). The ABCA, consisting of both multiple-choice and short-answer items, was originally designed using a question-type by subtopic matrix, validated by a panel of experts, and refined through pilot studies and factor analysis to create the final instrument. The concept map task included a short introduction to concept mapping, a prototype concept map, a practice concept-mapping activity, and the instructions for the acid-base concept map task.    The instruments were administered to chemistry students at two high schools; 108 subjects completed both instruments for this study. Factor analysis of ABCA results indicated that the test was unifactorial for these students, despite the intention to create an instrument with multiple “question-type” scales. Concept maps were scored both holistically and by counting valid concepts. The two approaches were highly correlated (r = 0.75). The correlation between ABCA score and concept-map score was 0.29 for holistically-scored concept maps and 0.33 for counted-concept maps. Although both correlations were significant, they accounted for only 8.8 and 10.2% of variance in ABCA scores, respectively. However, when the reliability of the instruments used is considered, more than 20% of the variance in ABCA scores may be explained by concept map scores.    MANOVAs for ABCA and concept map scores by instructor, student gender, and year in school showed significant differences for both holistic and counted concept-map scores. Discriminant analysis revealed that the source of these differences was the instruction variable. Significant differences between classes receiving different instruction were found in the frequency of concepts listed by students for 9 of 10 concepts evaluated. Mean ABCA scores did not differ significantly between the two instruction groups.    The results of this study failed to provide evidence of conceptual distinctions among different “types” of problem-solving items. The results suggested that several factors influence success in chemistry problem solving, including concept knowledge and organization. Further research into the nature of chemistry problems and problem solving is recommended.

T1  - The effect of individual and group concept mapping on students' conceptual understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration in three different academic levels of biology classes
AN  - 304612032
AB  - Student learning about photosynthesis and cellular respiration was measured after instruction involving individual, group or no concept mapping. This study involved 304 high school Biology students from three different Biology courses in a Mid-west high school. Students were classified as low, medium or high level of academic achievement. The control group consisted of 117 students who did not construct concept maps during a three-week unit on Photosynthesis and Cellular Respiration. The first of two experimental groups consisted of 92 students who created individual maps and the second consisted of 95 students who constructed maps in small groups during the unit. Pre- and post-tests were administered to the students using a gain score as the dependent variable. Covariates used in the statistical analysis were the students' Missouri Mastery and Achievement Tests scores, Iowa Test of Basic Skills scores and the students' current math level. Results from the analysis of co-variance showed a significant difference between the academic level of the student and the type of concept mapping on the dependent variable. In high academic level Biology classes, group mapping students obtained significant lower gain scores (M = 2.3) than the control group (M = 4.9). In the medium level Biology classes, group mapping students showed little difference in gain scores (M = 0.7) from the control group (M = 0.8). In the lower-level Biology classes, group mapping students (M = 2.3) showed significantly greater gain scores than those in the control group (M = 0.8). These results indicate that constructing concept maps in small groups can significantly increase the knowledge gained by lower-level students. An opposite effect is seen on high-level students who create concept maps in small groups. Creating concept maps as individuals appears to have no significant effect on achievement scores on the Biology students observed in this study.

T1  - ConMap: Investigating new computer-based approaches to assessing conceptual knowledge structure in physics
AN  - 304607196
AB  - There is a growing consensus among educational researchers that traditional problem-based assessments are not effective tools for diagnosing a student's knowledge state and for guiding pedagogical intervention, and that new tools grounded in the results of cognitive science research are needed. The  ConMap (“Conceptual Mapping”) project, described in this dissertation, proposed and investigated some novel methods for assessing the conceptual knowledge structure of physics students.    A set of brief computer-administered tasks for eliciting students' conceptual associations was designed. The basic approach of the tasks was to elicit spontaneous term associations from subjects by presenting them with a prompt term, or problem, or topic area, and having them type a set of response terms. Each response was recorded along with the time spent thinking of and typing it.    Several studies were conducted in which data was collected on introductory physics students' performance on the tasks. A detailed statistical description of the data was compiled. Phenomenological characterization of the data (description and statistical summary of observed patterns) provided insight into the way students respond to the tasks, and discovered some notable features to guide modeling efforts. Possible correlations were investigated, some among different aspects of the ConMap data, others between aspects of the data and students' in-course exam scores. Several correlations were found which suggest that the ConMap tasks can successfully reveal information about students' knowledge structuring and level of expertise. Similarity was observed between data from one of the tasks and results from a traditional concept map task.    Two rudimentary quantitative models for the temporal aspects of student performance on one of the tasks were constructed, one based on random probability distributions and the other on a detailed deterministic representation of conceptual knowledge structure. Both models were reasonably successful at approximating the statistical behavior of a typical student's data.

T1  - Understanding the biological concept “bird”: A kindergarten case study
AN  - 304605340
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative, multiple case study of 14 students in a metropolitan public school in the Deep South was to find out, during a period of three months, what these kindergarten-aged children knew about birds, whether this knowledge represented current scientific thought, if such science instruction meaningfully affected their prior knowledge, and if so, what the factors during instruction that seemed to influence their understanding of the concept of bird were. The research was conducted in three phases; preinstruction interviews, instruction, and postinstruction interviews.    The theoretical framework for this research was based on the Human Constructivism theory of learning (Mintzes, Wandersee and Novak, 1997). Instructional materials consisted of carefully chosen books (both fiction and non-fiction), guest speakers, field trips, a live bird in the classroom, students' observation journals, teacher-made classification and sorting activities, and picture-based concept maps.    The findings suggest that young children's knowledge of birds was limited chiefly to birds' anatomical and morphological characteristics, with repeated references being made by the children to human characteristics. There was a positive, significant difference in young children's pre- and postinstruction scientific knowledge of birds. Although performance varied from child to child after instruction, most children were able to identify some common birds by name. Just one child resisted conceptual change.    Kindergarten children's basic knowledge of bird behavior was limited to flight and eating. Although the children had more conceptual knowledge at the end, understanding still appeared to be shallow. The children did develop their skill in observing markedly. It also became evident that these kindergarten children needed more (a) experience in asking questions, (b) practice in techniques of visual representation, and (c) language development in order to be able to explain what they observed. Scientific study of birds appeared to be an underutilized gateway to learning about living organisms in early childhood, especially in view of the fact that birds are the only large animals in nature that are easily seen by children during daytime hours. Such early childhood bird studies also correlate well with the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996).

T1  - Emergent literacy and parent -child reading in Head Start families: The implementation and evaluation of a multigenerational reading program
AN  - 304593978
AB  - The current study presents the process and outcome evaluation of the Head Start Family Reading Project, a multigenerational reading program focusing on parent-child reading activities for Head Start families. The project had its origins in the Parent Involvement Committee of a local Head Start program, with a primary emphasis on how to facilitate parent involvement in the educational lives of their children. Given this foundation, Head Start sought to achieve this involvement through the content of parent-child reading activities. The philosophy of the reading program was shaped by the emergent literacy perspective and research focusing on the social nature of cognitive development.    The current study is based on a quasi-experimental design in which Head Start classrooms were assigned to either program or comparison status. Families in the program status received a reading program consisting of three components: (1) Book and activity packets sent home with the children on a weekly basis; (2) Reading support visits in which trained home visitors provided support for participating families; and (3) Center-based activities in which families came together around reading issues. Program families participated in the program for one academic year.    This reading program was evaluated using multiple methods. The three levels of evaluation conducted were: (1) Analyses of Program Planning, Implementation and Refinement; (2) Analyses of Staff and Participant Perceptions of the Program, using concept mapping methods; and (3) Analyses of Program Effects and Other Quantitative Relationships.    The process analyses communicate a variety of information that is relevant to the overall quality of the program, including: the nature of community input into the process; descriptions of the collaborative relationships formed through this project; and program successes and areas for improvement. Concept mapping analyses revealed that staff felt that the program had been most successful in areas related to the Parent-Child unit, while participants felt that the program had been most successful in areas related to the Child. Both staff and participants felt that the program achieved those items judged to be most important overall. However, the statistical analyses revealed that there were few identifiable ways in which the program families did better than the comparison families. On the other hand, staff reports of families' level of engagement in the program and parents' reports of childhood reading experience  were related to a variety of child and adult outcomes.    The Discussion Chapter addresses the study's contributions and limitations, emphasizing the difficulties associated with research in applied settings. The tension between rigorous research and responsive program delivery was constant throughout the process, contributing to an understanding of a need for ongoing work to explore these tensions and possible solutions. Building on the process evaluation, policy recommendations are provided in the arenas of parent involvement and emergent literacy. Additional research is proposed, with a specific emphasis on the need for evaluations to draw connections between process and outcome evaluation findings. The potential for concept mapping methods to contribute to a wide variety of studies is highlighted and further applications are recommended, especially for researchers interested in approaches that allow for broad participation of stakeholders in the research process.

T1  - Detecting changes in student teachers' conceptions of teaching science to adolescent English language learners
AN  - 304590757
AB  - This research study investigated the changes that occurred in six student teachers' conceptions of teaching science to adolescent English language learners over the duration of their participation in a one-year, graduate level, science teacher education program. Cases were created for each of the student teachers based on their concept maps, writing samples, interviews, lesson plans, informal interviews with cooperating teachers, and observation notes collected on biweekly visitations. The cases were divided into three dyads each consisting of two student teachers with similar preprogram and student teaching experiences. Cross case analysis revealed the existence of seven themes related to teaching science to adolescent English language learners. Further analysis suggested that student teachers that worked with experienced cooperating teachers and who had achieved a sense of autonomy over their student teaching demonstrated broad and sophisticated growth across all seven themes. Student teachers who had not achieved a sense of autonomy, demonstrated growth in two to three themes. Student teachers who demonstrated broad and sophisticated growth were able to clearly articulate their conceptions of teaching science to English language learners where as those who demonstrated limited growth were not.    This research establishes the use of concept maps as a tool for detecting changes in student teachers' conceptions of teaching science to adolescent English language learners as well as the sensitivity of concept maps to detect the types of changes historically detected by writing samples and interviews.    Recommendations based on the implications from are included.

T1  - The value of storytelling in the science classroom
AN  - 304590631
AB  - The “traditional science classroom” asks students, “What do we know in science?,” and ignores the question, “How do we know what we know?” The purpose of this research is to combine the powerful structure of narrative with the history of science in junior high school science classrooms. This study investigates whether history-of-science-based stories have advantages over traditional, lecture-style presentations. The storytelling approach aims to present science concepts in a meaningful and memorable context and in a coherent and connected manner.    The research program employed parallel curricula: science concepts were taught through novel stories and through lectures, at different times, to eight different groups of seventh and eighth grade students at Holy Name Junior High School in Worcester, Massachusetts. Students were assessed with pre- and post-tests and through individual interviews: Before, immediately after, and two weeks after the lessons, students were given short-answer questionnaires. Two weeks after each lesson, individual interviews were also conducted with a sampling of the students. The questionnaires were coded according to a clear set of written standards and the interviews were transformed into concept maps. Student learning and retention levels, gender differences, and alternate conceptions were quantitatively analyzed.    The results reveal that the students who were taught through stories learned the science concepts, on the average, 21% better and retained close to 48% more than the students who were taught through traditional lessons. Fewer alternate conceptions were expressed after story lessons than after lectures. Investigation of gender differences in learning science through the two methods revealed that boys profited more than girls did from the story lessons.    The union of narrative with the history of science in the form of story lessons seems natural since the spatiotemporal structure of a narrative mirrors the unfolding of actions in the history of science. This combination proved to be an effective science teaching method with these junior high students. In general, the story lessons helped the students better understand and retain the science concept than the traditional lessons did. The reason for the girls' smaller story gains are not clear, but may include a lack of female characters in the stories used. The over-all results are quite convincing in the sample of students studied and suggest a more generalized applicability. This line of research is well worth pursuing further.

T1  - Competencies of the leader of Palestinian community -based non -governmental organization in Israel: A prospective approach
AN  - 304587830
AB  - Palestinian community-based non-governmental organizations (PCBNGOs) in Israel have to cope with a turbulent environment, internally, locally, nationally and internationally. To deal with the opportunities, demands and threats imposed by their environments, the role of the leaders, therefore, is of prime importance. Many of the present leaders, however, have been criticized for their lack of effective leadership and accountability.    This study is exploratory, future-oriented, comparative and combines qualitative and quantitative data. Employing the ‘Concept Mapping’ method, presidents of PCBNGOs from three different areas, i.e. Mixed Palestinian-Jewish cities, segregated Palestinian towns from the North, and segregated Palestinian towns from the South were asked through small discussion groups to predict the most important issues facing their organizations. To succeed in the future, they were then asked to generate, rank order, and sort the abilities that they considered necessary for their leaders.    The study revealed that organizations from all three areas will face similar major issues as well as some different ones. One hundred eight competencies, conceptually divided into 15 clusters, were identified as common to leaders from all areas. All the abilities and clusters were ranked highly. The ratings of the clusters by area and other demographic variables show that their rank ordering according to importance is much the same across all subgroups.    Seven clusters were considered most important: Progressive and Committed Vision with Strategic Adaptability, Systematic, Social Activist, Adaptive Foresight, Interpersonally Open and Responsive, Democratic and Organized. These clusters focus mostly on the leaders and on their relationships with others. Three clusters were considered least important: Financial Know-how, External Acquaintance and Networks, and Diplomatic and Catalytic. These deal mainly with technical-financial issues, and with handling relationships with the outside environment.    The findings indicate that the issues facing the PCBNGOs differ largely from those of their counterparts in Western countries; we see, therefore, that although the leaders need some similar abilities, unique abilities in order to deal with their own environment are also required.

T1  - The devolution challenge: A case study of AmeriCorps
AN  - 304586581
AB  - AmeriCorps is a domestic service corps created by the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993. The program is administered through the federal Corporation for National Service, state commission offices, and local programs.    As AmeriCorps is just six years old, there are administrative issues, such as devolution, that must be considered in order to ensure the most efficient operation of the program. The purpose of this study is to investigate the perceived roles, responsibilities and needs of AmeriCorps staff, at the local, state and national level, to better prepare the program for forthcoming devolution efforts. The objectives are as follows: (1) To explore the current level of support and interaction among the local, state and national levels of AmeriCorps. (2) To better understand what devolution means to the key players at all levels. (3) To determine what state and local AmeriCorps programs need from the national headquarters in order to run effective programs that produce demonstrable results.    Concept mapping, a questionnaire and in-depth interviews with key players at each level were used to investigate these issues.    The results of the study suggest that the Corporation for National Service's emphasis on “getting things done” has created an administrative culture where “good paperwork equals good programs.” The relationships between levels are characterized by communication difficulties and frustration surrounding the paperwork. Furthermore, devolution was determined to be an on-going struggle, or creative tension, to balance the mandates from the national level with the needs of the state and local levels.    In order to facilitate devolution, a Corporation-wide culture shift was recommended—a major overhaul in philosophy that would affect all levels and challenge the current way of thinking and operating. Innovation and collaboration would be the focal point of the renewed culture, and proactive and reactive measures were suggested to implement the change. The importance of listening to the field and learning from past mistakes was stressed in regard to future research and devolution initiatives.

T1  - The effect of ability level and concept mapping on the achievement and retention of high school biology students
AN  - 304582171
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine if the treatments, concept mapping and ability level, had an effect on the immediate achievement and retention of high school biology students. This study utilized researcher-constructed concept maps and student-assisted concept maps. However, this study did not attempt to determine any differences between the contributions of each type to achievement and retention. Two biology classes were randomly designated experimental and two biology classes were randomly designated control classes. The four classes were taught the same material using the same teaching methods, except the experimental classes used concept maps. Both teacher-constructed concept maps and student-assisted concept maps were used.    Data from seven achievement tests and one retention test were collected. The achievement data were analyzed using multiple analysis of variance. The retention data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).    Data analysis failed to show any significant differences between the achievement of the experimental classes and control classes. The analysis indicated that high ability students achieved at a higher rate than low ability students. No significant interaction between ability and the concept mapping approach was detected. There was no significant difference between the retention of material of the control classes and experimental classes. The retention of high ability students was higher than that of the low ability students. The retention scores did not show an interaction between ability and concept mapping.    It was concluded that concept mapping does not increase the achievement or retention levels of biology students. It was also concluded that the achievement and retention of high ability students was higher than low ability students. There was no significant interaction between ability level and concept mapping based on achievement and retention scores.

T1  - The active use of concept mapping to promote meaningful learning in biological science
AN  - 301594066
AB  - The main findings can be summarised as:  (1) Quantitative methods of concept map analysis are inappropriate for promoting meaningful learning among secondary science teachers and their students.  It is too time-consuming, fails to recognise the individualised nature of learning and emphasises curriculum-centred notions of 'correctness' - a stance at odds with the constructivist viewpoint.  (2)  A qualitative approach to concept map analysis has been developed in this thesis.  It is shown to emphasise a contextual understanding of students' and teachers' conceptual ecologies in which development may indicate learning (through conceptual change) or switching (through contextual appreciation).  (3)  Finally, this work offers arguments against a rigid and didactic prescription of the curriculum that fails to respect the students' perspective.  A teacher-student dialogue to promote meaningful learning is likely to occur only when teachers question their own beliefs and approaches to teaching and learning.  Constructivist classroom approaches can be mediated by concept mapping to emphasise the exploration and sharing of meaning rather than absolute correctness.  Such approaches are likely to have an impact upon teaching quality and should be a key part of initial teacher-training and continued professional development.

T1  - How the cognitive style of students at key stage 4 affects their learning of science from printed materials that differ in their style of presentation (BL)
AN  - 301554806
AB  - It was found that students did better when they were presented with a concept map to accompany the text presentation.  The addition of a concept map helped all four cognitive style groups with recall questions and three of the four groups with understanding questions.  Analysis by cognitive style quadrant showed that the addition of the concept map helped three of the four cognitive style quadrants with recall questions and two of the four quadrants with understanding questions.  The role that cognitive style may play in gender differences of academic achievement was discussed.  Study 3b investigated students' receptivity to a concept map.  The students were presented with textual material from which the answers to 10 questions (five understanding and five recall) had been removed.  The results indicated that there were differences between the cognitive style group in the extent to which they were using the presented concept map.  The wholists tended to use the presented concept map less than the analytics.  The purpose of study 4 was to investigate if more could be done to help wholists accept a presented concept map or to modify and improve their internal learning framework to aid their learning.  There were two treatment groups.  One was supplied with a completed concept map and instructed to learn the textual material by learning the concept map presented to them.  The other was provided with an outline concept map and instructed to learn the textual material by completing the map using the textual material presented to them.  Both groups were given a test of recall and understanding.  The results showed that learning for analytics was helped if they were provided with a concept map while learning for wholists was enhanced when they were forced to construct a concept map. The significance of these findings, teaching techniques that assist students disadvantaged with a particular mode of presentation because of their cognitive style, and suggestions for further research were discussed.

T1  - An investigation of students' degree of concept links as a function of exposure to college chemistry courses: Assessment using concept maps
AN  - 276421188
AB  - Based on the constructivist model of learning, this research is a qualitative and quantitative strategy for investigating the extent to which chemistry students made connections between material presented in different chapters or courses as a function of their exposure to chemistry topics. Specifically, qualitative interviews were conducted once during the process of several semester long chemistry courses to determine the degree to which students had made links between the underlying concepts of electrons, bonding, and molecular geometry, which are all taught in the general chemistry curriculum. Concept maps drawn from the interviews were used as the analytical tool to assess subjects' links between these concepts. The study consisted of two parts, in which the degree of linkage was compared: (1) from students exposed to concept maps in class to those not exposed to concept maps, and (2) from freshmen chemistry level students through senior level chemistry students.

T1  - The Active Use of Concept Mapping to Promote Meaningful Learning in Biological Science
AN  - 2299779948
AB  - The focus of this work is the use of student concept mapping to promote meaningful learning in the classroom. All the studies reported were done in secondary schools and an undergraduate science course. All results and their discussion are presented within a human constructivist framework. The central question on which the research is based can be given as: How can concept mapping be used to contribute to understanding? This thesis is presented as a process of enquiry. Thus questions addressed by particular methodologies and approaches are later superseded with new questions and methods. This is consistent with a grounded approach and is part of an authentic constructivist research process. The main findings can be summarised as: 1. Quantitative methods of concept map analysis are inappropriate for promoting meaningful learning among secondary science teachers and their students. It is too time-consuming, fails to recognise the individualised nature of learning and emphasises curriculum-centred notions of ‘correctness’ - a stance at odds with the constructivist viewpoint. 2. A qualitative approach to concept map analysis has been developed in this thesis. It is shown to emphasise a contextual understanding of students’ and teachers’ conceptual ecologies in which development may indicate learning (through conceptual change) or switching (through contextual appreciation). 3. Finally, this work offers arguments against a rigid and didactic prescription of the curriculum that fails to respect the students’ perspective. A teacher-student dialogue to promote meaningful learning is likely to occur only when teachers question their own beliefs and approaches to teaching and learning. Constructivist classroom approaches can be mediated by concept mapping to emphasise the exploration and sharing of meaning rather than absolute correctness. Such approaches are likely to have an impact upon teaching quality and should be a key part of initial teacher-training and continued professional development.

T1  - Noncompliance among elderly diabetic patients: A phenomenological descriptive study
AN  - 220100240
AB  - This study explored the lived experience of noninsulin-dependent diabetic mellitus (NIDDM) elderly clients who bad been determined to be noncompliant with an established diabetic protocol. A nonrandomized purposive sample of 5 NIDDM subjects was selected. Existential phenomenology was used to explore the research question: What is the lived experience of NIDDM elderly diabetics who are noncompliant? Data were collected using a semistructured interview technique. A final validation was produced by returning to the subjects and asking them if the description formulated validated their original responses. According to the interviewed patients, the causative factors for getting diabetes were heredity, marriage, job, and taking care of elderly family members. The difficult aspects in diabetes management were exercise, diet, traveling, and stress control. The patients were responsible for their own diabetes management. To live with diabetes year after year felt normal, a lot easier, or much more difficult. Findings are presented in concept map form. An extensive interview of the literature and contextualizing of findings into Sackett's (1976) hypothesized model for predicting and explaining compliance with therapeutic regimens model focus the data analysis. Recommendations for nursing practice, education, and research are provided.

T1  - Effects on spouses of caring for a partner with dementia
AN  - 304548262
AB  - A list of 76 statements was gathered in response to the prompt, Please list the effects that caring for someone with memory problems has had on you. Twenty-two spouse caregivers of individuals with dementia responded to this prompt. Concept Mapping was then used to identify seven underlying themes from these statements. These themes were labelled Managing our Surroundings, Disengaging, Shifting Responsibilities, Reacting to Spouse's Confusion, Feeling Helpless, Burning Out. This manner of conceptualizing perceptions about caring for a spouse was unique when compared with previous research.    Sixty-eight spouse caregivers were asked to rate how much these 76 perception statements applied to their lives as well as to complete a Caregiver Burden Inventory. Perceptions labelled Burning Out and Feeling Helpless had the lowest incidence in this sample. Perceptions labelled Learning to Cope, Shifting Responsibilities, and Reacting to a Spouse's Confusion had a higher incidence among these caregivers. Caregivers were most highly affected by their reactions to their spouse's confusion and shifting of responsibilities within their marital relationship. They found coping strategies that helped in their lives. A majority did not use formal support services.    A high overall endorsement of perception statements within the themes labelled Managing our Surroundings, Disengaging, Shifting Responsibilities, Reacting to Spouse's Confusion, Feeling Helpless, Burning Out was associated with high levels of burden. These results suggested that Concept Mapping may be useful for developing scales based on self report items. The Concept Map offered a valuable pictorial tool for interventions with caregivers. Further research to describe perceptions and related themes about coping with caring for a spouse with dementia would be useful.

T1  - The impact of the Internet tool in promoting scientific literacy. Case study: Circulation unit in a health occupation course
AN  - 304541447
AB  - This study investigated the impact of the Internet, as a research tool, in promoting scientific literacy. Two health occupation classes participated in identical instructional strategies, concept mapping, conceptual change, and collaborative learning. The experimental group had access to the Internet to investigate information regarding the physiology of the cardiovascular system. The control group did not use the Internet. Both classes used books and computer software to investigate the same topics. The evaluations of the impact of Internet were based on students' acquisition of knowledge in the content area and development of inquiry skills and habits of mind. The study showed that the use of the Internet did not cause any measurable differences between the control group and experimental group in the acquisition of knowledge and development of habits of mind. Regarding inquiry skills, the use of the Internet provided the students in the experimental group to have more opportunities to develop critical thinking and evaluating skills than the control group.

T1  - A case study of the development of four prospective elementary teachers' conceptual frameworks on learning and teaching science
AN  - 304540609
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative case study was to examine the development of science learning and teaching frameworks of four prospective elementary teachers at three critical points during their teacher preparation program. By deeply examining the conceptual development of these prospective teachers, the researcher hoped to construct an explanation for and a set of program recommendations about the ways constructivist aspects of a teaching framework are understood and developed.    Using a grounded theory approach, the researcher developed snapshots of the participants' frameworks for science teaching at three points over a 26-month period through the collection and analysis of multiple data sources. Prospective teachers were interviewed at the beginning of a pre-student teaching block. Written journals, concept maps, and other participant-provided data were also collected. The researcher again collected data just prior to student teaching. The third set of data was as the participants were completing student teaching. In all instances, interview questions were open-ended and were designed to prompt reflection upon their emerging frameworks. The data were inductively analyzed, following techniques associated with a grounded theory method.    A two-pronged theory about the development of science teaching frameworks emerged from a careful interpretation of the data. The first prong suggests that reflection on dissonance associated with an unsatisfactory science teaching and learning experience resulted in prospective teachers developing a readiness to reconceptualize their frameworks for teaching and learning science toward a range of orientations more consistent with a constructivist epistemology and a conceptual change orientation. This reflection, readiness and reconceptualization appears necessary, but insufficient to completely explain the development of high status conceptions of teaching and learning science. It appeared that recognition from the prospective teachers' mentors is an important mechanism for raising the status of teaching and learning conceptions to the level of fruitfulness.    Implications are drawn for applying conceptual change theory to further study of initial teacher learning. Practical recommendations for the design and delivery of coherent teacher education programs that endeavor to promote high status constructivist conceptions are presented in the final chapter.

T1  - Concept maps as organizers in an introductory university level biology course
AN  - 304530931
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine whether or not a concept map organizer improved recall of lecture material in an introductory university biology course to a statistically significant degree over an outline organizer. It is important that students learn the multiple connections between concepts even within one lecture. The concept map organizer provides a visual display that shows the multiple connections in an explicit manner as opposed to a list of terms shown in an outline.    A one-between, two-within, repeated measures design was used to assess student achievement when presented with both types of lectures-organized either by an outline or concept map. An analysis of variance was performed on the data collected with 170 students included in the sample out of a population of approximately 466. In addition, a survey was given three months after the pre- and post-test data were collected. The survey was constructed to ask the participants to recall the lecture organizers used in the study, their preference of organizer, and belief in the organizers' usefulness as a learning tool. A control population was asked to choose their preference of organizer and belief in the organizers' usefulness as a learning tool.    It was found that achievement improved to a statistically significant and meaningful level when students were presented lectures using a concept map organizer. Achievement was higher when students were shown lectures using the concept map organizer as compared to the outline organizer. The participants preferred a mixture of organizers for lecture presentations and believed that the concept map was more useful than the outline. The control group preferred the outline and believed that the outline was more useful as a learning tool. It is recommended, as a result of this study, that more lectures be organized in the form of a concept map at the introductory university level in biology.

T1  - To group or not to group: Effects of groupwork on students' declarative and procedural knowledge in science
AN  - 304526477
AB  - This study investigated the effect of two instructional treatments  groupwork using Complex Instruction and individual  inquiry on students' individual science achievement (declarative and procedural knowledge). Declarative knowledge pertains to the quantity and structure of content knowledge; procedural knowledge to actions and skills. This study also examined whether the assessments measured the same or different aspects of knowledge based on student performance.    Sixth grade students (N = 128) and teachers (N = 4) from an ethnically diverse, rural elementary school in Central Valley, California participated. They were stratified by reading scores, randomly assigned to one of four classes, and completed identical open-ended instructional activities. Each class was randomly assigned to one of the two instructional treatments. Teachers were randomly assigned to condition, two in each. The treatment x teacher:treatment x assessment design had repeated measures on assessment: multiple-choice, concept map, and performance. Students completed all assessments individually. Prior to treatment there were no statistically significant mean differences in students' reading or multiple-choice pretest scores for classes or treatments.    For all assessments, mean scores in groupwork were statistically significantly higher than in individual but not significant between teachers within treatments. Differences in means were due to treatment not a unique teacher effect.    Analyses indicated statistically significant mean differences by treatment and reading level but no statistically significant difference due to teachers within treatment or treatment by reading level interaction. Post hoc comparisons revealed differences by treatment and reading level for all assessments except on the multiple-choice test for students reading above grade level. For multiple-choice and concept-map tests, students reading below grade level in groupwork had equivalent mean scores to students reading at grade level in individual. For performance assessment students reading below grade level in groupwork had significantly higher mean scores than students reading at grade level and equivalent to students reading above grade level in individual. Correlations indicated that concept-map and multiple-choice test scores tapped declarative knowledge whereas performance assessment scores captured procedural knowledge.

T1  - Learner factors associated with radical conceptual change among undergraduates
AN  - 304524932
AB  - Students frequently enter learning situations with knowledge inconsistent with scientific views. One goal of science instruction is to enable students to construct scientifically accepted ideas while rejecting inaccurate constructs. This process is called conceptual change. This study examined factors associated with students at three levels of conceptual change to elucidate possible influences on the conceptual change process.    Factors studied included motivation (including utility value, interest, attainment value, mood, self efficacy, and task difficulty), prior experiences with science, perceptions of the nature of science, connections to objects or events outside the classroom, and specific activities that helped students learn. Four science classes for undergraduate preservice elementary teachers participated in the study, conducted during a three week unit on electricity. Data sources included concept maps, drawings, reflective journal entries, quizzes, a science autobiography assignment, and interviews. Concept maps, drawings, and quizzes were analyzed, and students were placed into high, moderate, and low conceptual change groups. Of the ninety-eight students in the study, fifty-seven were interviewed.    Perhaps the most important finding of this study relates to the assessment of conceptual change. Interviews were conducted two months after the unit, and many items on the concept maps had decayed from students' memories. This indicates that time is an important factor. In addition, interview-derived data demonstrated conceptual change levels; concept maps were insufficient to indicate the depth of students' understanding.    Factors associated with conceptual change include self efficacy and interest in topic. In addition, moderate conceptual change students cited specific activities as having helped them learn. Low and high students focused on the method of instruction rather than specific activities. Factors not found to be associated with conceptual change include: utility value, mood, task difficulty, and prior experiences with science, and connections to objects and events outside the classroom. Attainment value, perceptions of the nature of science, and mood cannot be ruled out as possible factors due to the problematic nature of assessing them within the context of this study.

T1  - Reflections on aspects of education in post-Communist Poland: A personal journey with selected educators, parents, and students of Poland
AN  - 304518939
AB  - This personal, constructivist study was a journey of learning for the researcher. It included a striving to make meaning of selected Polish educators and other educational participants and their perspectives concerning education in Poland today. The study resulted in personal perceptions of the researcher regarding these selected Polish educators and other educational participants and their thoughts, feelings and beliefs concerning education in post-communist Poland.    Demographic data were gathered through the use of a questionnaire and presented through narrative and typical descriptive devices such as charts and tables. This data included age and marital status, years in employment, average monthly income, and level of education of the participants as well as the level of education of the participants' children.    Qualitative data were gathered from the researcher's interviews, personal reflective journals, field notes and collected relevant artifacts. It was presented primarily through the use of narrative, accompanied by concept maps where appropriate. Pictures were included to add to the description and analysis presented.    Selected educators and other educational participants included teachers, school administrators or head masters, students, parents, and other people involved in education. They discussed their personal lives, their involvement with education, the strengths of the current educational system in Poland, the problems and challenges facing education in Poland, potential solutions to these problems, potential barriers to the solutions, a philosophical base and the purposes for education in Poland today, core values to guide education, and other general information about education.

T1  - Investigating teachers' understanding and diagnosis of students' preconceptions in the secondary science classroom
AN  - 304517301
AB  - A large amount of research has been conducted that establishes that students of all ages hold conceptions about a variety of science topics that are not in line with accepted scientific beliefs. These preconceptions have been identified in a variety of ways in research situations; this study focused on how secondary science teachers actually attempt to diagnose students' preconceptions in the classroom and the understanding the teachers have about these preconceptions. The use the teachers made of any information gathered in a diagnosis and the reasons for a lack of diagnosis were also investigated.    Four experienced science teachers were studied in depth, they were interviewed three times and classroom observations were conducted for nine weeks. The teachers' classroom practices, questioning techniques, understanding of students' preconceptions, and assessment of students' understanding were all analyzed.    In this study, the teachers did not use any formal strategies for diagnosing students' preconceptions such as concept mapping, interviews, journals, or writing prompts. The teachers studied claimed that it was important to conduct diagnosis but only one teacher was seen to actually do so. The teacher who did use class discussions as a strategy for diagnosis was the most experienced teacher of the four and also the teacher with the strongest subject matter background. The other three teachers all claimed that they did do diagnosis of preconceptions by questioning their students but they were not seen to do this in their classes.    The conclusions from these results are that the teachers did not have a complete understanding of the concept of diagnosing students' preconceptions in order to use that information to attempt conceptual change. The teachers' beliefs were not consistent with their practices in this situation; they may have had certain constraints on them that inhibited the translation of their beliefs into practice.    The implications are that preservice and inservice teachers may need to be trained about the importance of, the strategies involved with, and the justification for diagnosing students' preconceptions in the regular classroom environment. Teachers must have an understanding of students' preconceptions and the effect they have on students' learning.

T1  - Multidimensional representations: The knowledge domain of germs held by students, teachers and medical professionals
AN  - 304516663
AB  - The present study examined the understandings held by 5th, 8th, and 11th-grade students, their teachers and medical professionals about germs. Specifically, this study describes the content and structure of students' and adults' conceptions in the areas of germ contraction, transmission, and treatment of infectious and non-infectious diseases caused by microorganisms.    Naturalistic and empirical research methods were used to investigate participants' conceptions. Between and within group similarities were found using data from concept maps on the topic “flu,” drawings of germs, a 20 word card sort related to germs and illness, and a semi-structured interview. Concept maps were coded according to techniques by Novak and Gowan (1984). Drawings of germs were coded into four main categories (bacteria, viruses, animal cell, other) and five subcategories (disease, caricature, insect, protozoa, unclassified). Cluster patterns for the card sorts of each group were found using multidimensional scaling techniques. Six coding categories emerged from the interview transcripts: (a) transmission, (b) treatment, (c) effect of weather on illness, (d) immune response, (e) location of germs, and (f) similarities and differences between bacteria and viruses.    The findings showed students, teachers and medical professionals have different understandings about bacteria and viruses and the structures of those understandings vary. Gaps or holes in the participants knowledge were found in areas such as: (a) how germs are transmitted, (b) where germs are found, (c) how the body transports and uses medicine, (d) how the immune system functions, (e) the difference between vaccines and non-prescription medicines, (f) differences that exist between bacteria and viruses, and (g) bacterial resistance to medication.    The youngest students relied heavily upon personal experiences with germs rather than formal instruction when explaining their conceptions. As a result, the influence of media was evident in the students' understandings and images of microbes. Students also viewed germs as a human problem rather than seeing microorganisms as an independent member of the ecosystem.    Teachers' explanations about germs varied in explicitness based on the grade level they taught while medical professionals based their understandings on formal knowledge and tended to use explicit technical language in their explanations of the phenomena.

T1  - College students' understanding of stereochemistry: Difficulties in learning and critical junctures
AN  - 304512391
AB  - Because stereochemistry is an important part of both high school and college chemistry curricula, a study of difficulties experienced by students in the learning of stereochemistry was undertaken in a one-semester college organic chemistry course. This study, conducted over the course of two semesters with more than two hundred students, utilized clinical interviews, concept maps, and student journals to identify these difficulties, which were then tabulated and categorized. Although student journals were not a productive source of information, the types of difficulties that emerged from the concept maps were compared and contrasted with those that emerged from the clinical interviews.    Data from the concept maps were analyzed using Kendall's W, a nonparametric statistic that was deemed appropriate for determining concordance between individual concept maps. The correlation between values of Kendall's W for sets of concept maps and multiple choice questions designed to evaluate the content of these same maps was determined, with values of Pearson's r of .8093 (p = .051) and .7191 (p = .044) for the Fall, 1997 and Spring, 1998 semesters, respectively. These data were used to estimate the occurrence of critical junctures in the learning of stereochemistry, or points at which students must possess a certain framework of understanding of previous concepts in order to master new material (Trowbridge & Wandersee, 1994). One critical juncture was identified that occurred when the topics of enantiorners, absolute configuration, and inversion of configuration were introduced.    Among the more important conclusions of this study to the learning of stereochemistry are the following. Both concept maps and interviews provided useful information regarding difficulties in the learning of stereochemistry; this information was complementary in some aspects and similar in others. Concept maps were useful in diagnosing difficulties in application of terms and definitions, whereas interviews were useful when seeking information about difficulties in the manipulation of chemical structures. Both concept maps and interviews were superior to student journals as tools to probe student difficulties in the learning of stereochemistry.

T1  - Gaps in college biology students' understanding of photosynthesis: Implications for human constructivist learning theory and college classroom practice
AN  - 304512375
AB  - The main research question of this study was: What gaps in biochemical understanding are revealed by a range of university introductory biology students as they work through a critically acclaimed multimedia program on photosynthesis, and what are the corresponding implications for elaboration of the Ausubel-Novak-Gowin Learning Theory (ANG, now Human Constructivism)? Twelve students, mixed for ability, gender and ethnicity, were recruited from two sections of “Bio 101.” Before and after instruction in photosynthesis, in-depth clinical interviews were conducted during which participants completed a range of cognitive tasks such as sorting, concept mapping, explaining and predicting. Some tasks involved interacting with a computer simulation of photosynthesis. This study primarily employed qualitative case study and verbal analysis methods.    Verbal analysis of the clinical interviews revealed numerous gaps that were categorized into typologies. The two major categories were propositional gaps and processing gaps. Propositional gaps were evident in development of participants' concepts, links and constructs. Significant among these were conceptual distance gaps and continuity of matter gaps. Gaps such as convention gaps and relative significance gaps seem to be due to naivete in the discipline. Processing gaps included gaps in graphic decoding skills and relevant cognitive habits such as self-monitoring and consulting prior knowledge. Although the gaps were easier to detect and isolate with the above-average participants, all participants showed evidence of at least some of these gaps. Since some gaps are not unexpected at all but the highest literacy levels, not all the gaps identified are to be considered deficiencies.    The gaps identified support the attention given by ANG theorists to the role of prior knowledge and metacognition as well as the value of graphic organizers in knowledge construction. In addition, this study revealed numerous gaps in graphic decoding, indicating that both direct experience and explicit instruction are needed if students are to “learn how to learn with graphics,” especially those graphics central to understanding a computer simulation's representations of structures, inputs, processes and outputs. It is hypothesized that gaps similar to those revealed in this study may be at the root of some alternative conceptions documented in the literature.

T1  - The effect of computer simulations and the learning cycle on students' conceptual understanding of Newton's three laws of motion
AN  - 304512227
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine how three different methods of instruction would affect a student's conceptual understanding of Sir Isaac Newton's three laws of motion. The three methods were the expository, learning cycle, and computer simulations. Three sections of students enrolled in a suburban mid-western high school's introductory physics course were the subjects of this study.    The students' conceptual understanding of Newton's three laws of motion were assessed prior to and after instructional treatment with concept mapping. All concept maps were scored by the teacher and a colleague well-practiced in the use of concept maps. The inter-rater reliability coefficients ranged from 0.23 to 0.61.    After instruction, a 2-tier multiple-choice instrument was used to determine if any gains had been achieved in students' conceptual understanding as well as to identify any remaining misconceptions. All gain scores in concept mapping assessment categories were analyzed using one-way ANOVAs. ANOVAs were also run on all 12 individual items on the 2-tier test as well as overall student total scores, No significant differences were found between any of the groups. The split-half reliability of the two-tier instrument was 0.59. Difficulty indices ranged from 0.12 to 0.56, and discrimination indices ranged from 0.11 to 0.61. Each item was analyzed to determine student understanding of, and identifying misconceptions about the nature of forces as they pertain to Newton's laws of motion.    Analysis of concept mapping results and 2-tier items, clearly indicated that most of the students in all groups still adhere to the common misconception that motion implies that a force must be present in order to maintain an object's state of motion or conversely that no motion implies that there are no forces acting on the object.

T1  - Concept mapping: An instructional tool for learning economics and a research tool for determining students' understanding of economics
AN  - 304510643
AB  - This study evaluated the concept mapping learning strategy as an aid to the learning Of economics and explored the changing knowledge schemata of learners during a two-week course of instruction in economics. Although students using the concept mapping learning strategy did not show significantly greater scores on the economics posttest than those using guided reflective journaling, the pre- to post-test gain was significant for both the experimental and comparison groups, suggesting that all students learned economics during the class. Analysis of covariance suggested the major predictor of a student's post-test score was the pre-test score measuring prior knowledge of economics. It accounted for 30% of the variance indicating that prior knowledge of economics was an important variable contributing to the future learning of economics. Furthermore, the twenty-seven pre- and post-instruction concept maps created by the participants in the two-week economic education course provided a rich source of qualitative data on the students' process of learning economics.    It is suggested that concept mapping, though not proven effective as an instructional aid in this study, be tried in studies of longer duration or that use alternative forms of assessment to measure knowledge. Concept mapping is a useful tool for discovering students' prior knowledge of economics, observing developing understandings, and identifying misconceptions. These insights are valuable to curriculum planners and teachers. Although not specifically explored in this study, concept mapping has potential as an evaluation tool. The concept map provides a wealth of valuable information about the learning process and students' understandings.    Experts have developed standards for key economic concepts recommended for kindergarten through twelfth grade. This study suggests a need to further refine an organizing framework that recognizes the inter-relatedness of the key economic concepts. This organizing framework would move the focus of instruction toward relationships among and between concepts rather than on isolated bits of information. As students learn this connected-ness of knowledge they will be better able to apply the knowledge in various situations.

T1  - Concept maps: Their uses for knowledge acquisition and computer-based learning
AN  - 304508711
AB  - Concept maps have been used extensively in education, both for curriculum design and for communication of knowledge. They have also been used by anthropologists in building ethnographies, by physicians building medical vocabularies, and by computer scientists in building GUI interfaces.    Anecdotal evidence suggests that concept maps are widely used, because they provide a visual image of the concepts under study in a tangible form. Also, they allow us to identify a particular focus and to shift perspective easily. There seem to be few experimental studies to demonstrate their effectiveness, however, so we determined to carry out a study of this kind and also build some potentially useful learning systems.    Experience with medical students has shown that many of them have memorized the prerequisite information but still have serious difficulty in using this information in solving problems. We set out to discover whether giving these students a chance to visualize the relationships between the parameters by building a concept map improves their ability to solve problems. In the discovery process we have constructed a knowledge acquisition tool for concept maps and a computer-based instruction program for visualization of concept maps.    Our tutor invites the student to build a concept map as a way of visualizing the knowledge gained from lectures and assigned reading. The tutor begins with an introductory tutorial that reminds the student about the concepts of direct and inverse proportionality and shows them how to represent these concepts in the mapping process. It also points out the differences between immediate causes and more distant ones. Then it presents the students with the names of nine important parameters and asks them to place them as nodes on the map and draw the causal links between them.    Preliminary experimental results suggest that building a concept map not only increases the students' knowledge of parameters and the relationships between them but also improves the students' ability to solve problems of several different kinds.    We have also constructed a system to automate the knowledge acquisition process. We hope to use this tool in extending the CIRCSIM-Tutor paradigm to other tutors, beginning with GASP-Tutor.

T1  - Internationally-focused managerial behaviors of executives working in large United States multinational corporations
AN  - 304508564
AB  - The purpose of this study was to profile the unique internationally-focused managerial behaviors of senior-level American executives managing in multinational organizations. The increasing importance of foreign markets has forced U.S. corporations to aggressively expand their international operations. Senior-level executives, whose experiences are primarily formed within U.S. markets, are struggling to adapt to these conditions. Human Resource Development professionals are striving to support executives with developmental interventions to fulfill this educational need; however, their efforts are hampered because the composition or profile of a successful internationally active senior-level executive remains unclear. This study provided a profile of 94 executive behaviors unique to conducting business in international settings.    The profile was developed using concept mapping research methodology. A survey of 35 successful managers and executives was conducted. Respondents were asked to rate each of the 94 behaviors to determine which behaviors were most important. Respondents also sorted the behaviors into categories or clusters. Sorting and rating data were analyzed using the Concept System®  concept mapping software.    The behaviors were grouped into 12 logical categories including: Global Intelligence, Open and Flexible, Cross-Cultural Communication, Cultural Sensitivity, Cultural Awareness, Global Visionary, Global Awareness, Personal Stamina, Vision, Strategy, Mission, Local Execution, Local HR Development, and Management Interface. The primary distinguishing elements of success for executives working in international positions were found to be focused on personal characteristics and traits. A list of the 20 most important behaviors is provided to illustrate the critical elements of success.    The distinguishing behaviors of executives managing in multinational organizations identified by middle managers were compared to the distinguishing behaviors identified by executives. Managers and executives were in overall agreement as to the most important elements of success in international business. Differences between the two groups of managers centered around strategic outlook and interpersonal skills.    Recommendations to the field of International Human Resource Development include screening managers for personal characteristics and traits, making expatriate assignments available for high-potential managers, encouraging senior-level executives to regularly visit foreign operations, rotating foreign managers to U.S. headquarters, and training all managers in a variety of international skills such as gathering global intelligence.

T1  - Frameworks of reference: How (some) college students think about biological evolution
AN  - 304503771
AB  - Evolution, a key concept for understanding all of biology, is often misunderstood by students from elementary school to graduate school. In order to teach evolution effectively, as well as to teach the biological concepts necessary for understanding evolution, teachers need to understand the initial ideas that students bring with them to the learning experience. Research has shown that many students are likely to hold alternative conceptions that may block their ability to learn evolution.    The goal of this study is to contribute to the effectiveness of teaching evolution at the high school and college levels both by investigating concepts that students bring with them to their first college study of evolution, and by examining the conceptual frameworks that support these students as they construct new understanding.    This study was executed in two stages. An initial survey of evolutionary understanding was administered to 203 undergraduate students in two courses at two universities in the area of Boston, MA. The surveys elicited short, written responses to five real and fictitious scenarios about biological inheritance and evolutionary change. Responses were coded into categories of concepts. The data were analyzed for patterns of understanding. Students exhibiting concepts from each of the major categories were randomly selected to participate in the subsequent interview stage of the study.    Interviews with six of the students were conducted based on an interview guide employing scenarios similar to those from the survey. Analyses of the interview transcripts included the construction of detailed concept maps for each response followed by narratives of each interviewee's conceptual frameworks.    The results of both stages of the study revealed a range of alternative conceptions about evolution, including scientifically acceptable Darwinian ideas and other ideas—including Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics—are not accepted by modern science. The interviews revealed a range of reasoning styles and frameworks that explained how students could find these ideas plausible.    The study concludes with recommendations for further research on the understanding of evolutionary topics; for adaptations of the research methods; and for teaching strategies to address the findings.

T1  - Political thought processes of social studies teachers: An interpretive study of expert teachers of civics /citizenship
AN  - 304501454
AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to examine the content knowledge base, and political thought processes of a select group of expert teachers of civics/citizenship utilizing the Civitas (1994) framework of national standards for civics education as a content standard. Further constructs examined included: Perspective taking ability, response context, ideology, dogmatism and indoctrination. Other models used in this study include the political thought model of Rosenberg (1988) and the Engle and Ochoa (1988) model of decision making in civics. The chief aim of this study was to assess the relationship of expert content knowledge to ideology, perspective taking skills, response context, and effective teaching practices in the civics classroom.    Methodology. A qualitative design was utilized in an in-depth case study of six (6) identified expert teachers of civics/citizenship selected in a stratified random sample from a pool of teachers nominated by colleagues and supervisors of various school systems in a large metropolitan southeastern city. This study consisted of a series of interviews in which the respondents answered the following question: What are the primary issues and values associated with a constitutional democracy? The respondents were asked to identify an issue and defend a position that was opposite of their beliefs. Finally, the respondents were asked to state how they would teach about a constitutional democracy in a typical classroom.    A constant comparative style of interpretive analysis was utilized to examine the resulting data. The researcher was a participant observer. Both the transcripts of the interviews and the concept maps generated by the respondents were analyzed using content analysis to determine the expert content knowledge of each respondent, the perspective taking ability of each respondent, and the level of sophistication in their responses. Additional categories generated during the analysis of the data included: content versus issues oriented responses, dogmatism, and beliefs about indoctrination.    Results. Only two of the respondents demonstrated sufficient content knowledge to be called expert teachers. Furthermore, respondents with the most expert knowledge characteristics were also the most likely to exhibit conceptual sophistication, advanced perspective taking skills, and a blended content and issues oriented response context. Teachers who held extreme political beliefs exhibited the most characteristics of dogmatism and were less likely to be content knowledge experts.    Further research into the relationship between stated ideological beliefs and actual classroom practices, as well as a new research paradigm in political socialization are recommended.

T1  - The investigation of exploratory learning strategies using computer-based modeling tools when solving veterinarian clinical case study problems
AN  - 304501411
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of using two types of exploratory, model-based learning activities to help participants solve clinical case study problems in the content domain of veterinarian pharmacokinetics. A total of 75 veterinary medicine students used a computer modeling program called STELLA to either construct a model of a pharmacokinetic system to help solve a clinical case study problem, or to experiment with a model already constructed. This study investigated two model-based learning approaches: (1) Model-Provided Learning and (2) Model-Assembling Learning. It was hypothesized that Model-Assembling learning would allow participants to use more inductive reasoning strategies by creating their own model and promote self-reflection on a specific mental model. Furthermore, it was believed that this approach would allow participants to make their mental models explicit and test them against the mathematical and scientific models (i.e., conceptual models) presented to them during the instruction.    Results indicated that metacognitive awareness as measured by the Metacognitive Awareness Inventory (MAI) was not a good predictor for learning outcomes as measured by an instructor-developed exam. The Model-Assembling group outperformed the Model-Provided group on an Instructor-Developed test designed to measure both basic-level and inference-level comprehension of the concepts of pharmacokinetics presented in the case study problem. Descriptive data collected provided an understanding of the nature of the strategic knowledge (cognitive and metacognitive) that students brought to bear on the problem-solving tasks using the software and materials provided. Mental model analyses of concept maps drawn by a select number of participants indicated that they had to actively test and revise their mental via a trial-and-error approach using STELLA.    Recommendations are provided for educators interested in using model-based learning activities and modeling tools such as STELLA to teach complex science concepts. These recommendations are based on a comparison of the results of this study along with an analysis of relevant research literature. Recommendations include the use of support measures, model progression techniques, adequate training, collaborative learning, and other learning environment issues.

T1  - The impact of Korean language accommodations on concept mapping tasks for Korean American English language learners
AN  - 304497087
AB  - As the U.S. population becomes increasingly multicultural, there is growing need in assessment for the valid accommodation of English Language Learner (ELL) students. The purpose of this study was to examine the similarities and differences in performance of Korean American sixth-, seventh- and eighth-grade ELL students taking an English version of a concept mapping task (showing relationships graphically) in environmental science with either no language accommodation or with accommodation through translations and aid in making propositions (which took into account the Korean proposition word order of subject-object-verb). The study was conducted in two parts (a) ELL and non-ELL students taking concept mapping tasks using paper and stickers (the Stickers Accommodation Study) and (b) only ELL students taking both a computer version of the concept mapping task and the stickers version (the Repeated Measures Study). For the Stickers Accommodation Study, results did not show significant differences between accommodated and non-accommodated groups. Background variables like prior knowledge, length of time in U.S., and English academic language proficiencies did predict concept mapping performance of the Stickers Accommodations Study students as a whole. The various outcome measures were analyzed as a latent variable using confirmatory factor analysis with background variable covariates, or MIMIC modeling. Prior knowledge was the only variable found to be significant predictors of the factor, as measured by concept mapping, concept map summary and explanation task performance for both ESL and non-ESL participants in the Stickers Accommodation Study. The same result was found for the ESL students only. In the Repeated Measures Study, differences were examined between performance on a Korean-only and an English-with-Korean-translation version of a computer concept mapping task. There was a significant difference for the Repeated Measures Study students in favor of students taking the English-with-Korean-translation version. A MIMIC model was also run for the Repeated Measures Study and additional background variables like academic language proficiencies in both English and Korean and prior formal schooling were found to be significant predictors. A discussion of the findings and implications for future research are presented.

T1  - Effects of concept maps and dialogue journals on bilingual students' conceptual understanding in science
AN  - 304494162
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of using concept maps or dialogue journals on bilingual students' conceptual understanding in science. Three fourth grade classes, which included 60 students, using the Science and Technology for Children, Plant Growth and Development unit participated in the study. The vocabulary knowledge and conceptual understanding of bilingual and native English students in three treatment groups were compared. The study was conducted over a three month period.    The three treatment groups consisted of (1) a control group using only the Science and Technology for Children, Plant Growth and Development unit, (2) the concept map treatment group, and (3) the dialogue journal treatment group. Student achievement was measured using a pretest and a posttest.    Significant differences in the pretest and posttest scores were found for all three treatment groups. The concept map treatment group scored significantly higher than the dialogue journal and control groups on the posttest. The use of concept maps was found to be highly effective for both native English and bilingual students.

T1  - Students as a resource to learning and their achievement
AN  - 301604744
AB  - Research into the teaching of science has suggested that student learning resulted from personal and social processes promoting communication and construction of knowledge. The teacher has an interventionist role. The current research project aims to investigate the process of student involvement during instruction by dialogue and if such involvement has an effect on learning outcomes. Videotapes were made of thirteen biology lessons for year 10 students in a girls independent selective school. Individual student behaviour profiles in relation to answering and asking questions, the psychological cognitive demands made of the students in answering questions, and the teacher's questions and immediate help provided for the students to answer them, added to the picture of the interactions. The evidence suggested that the teacher made the students a resource to learning. Qualitative analysis showed how the teacher's strategies helped students locate and link topic information. Socratic questioning and scaffolding techniques were identified but scaffolding did not involve fading. The students utilised prior and new information, and scaffolded one another. Concept maps were used to represent how teacher and student interaction lead to expanded networks of information. A theoretical analysis of the dialogue illustrated parallel and reciprocal teacher and student activities. This allowed the construction of a model of learning within an integration theory framework. Individual student profiles showed that low participation was associated with low success in answering questions in lessons. Greater participation in the dialogue was linked to greater success. There was not a direct relationship between participation and success. A comparison of students' behaviour during lessons and examinations results showed that the lower rates of participation in the dialogue led to the least successful examination performance. Higher level participation in the lessons led to more successful examination performance, but there was not a simple relationship between the two.

AB  - Citizens of the Knowledge Age have to be skilled in the construction of meaningful knowledge; in the collecting, anal.yzing, synthesizing, and organizing of information. These demands are driving educational technologj'^ research to find new theory and practices. Constructivism, an emerging theory of learning, offers new perspectives and is expected to have a major influence on education in the near future. Yet today, despite increasing efforts, considerable research is still needed to determine how best to apply constructivist ideas to educational software and to prove or disprove its effectiveness. This thesis presents the ReMemex system, a software tool, which both aids knowledge workers to collect and organize information, and provides a basis for research into the application of constructivist learning theoiy in educational software. ReMemex is a framework for a knowledge construction and organization environment, where learners create information landscapes to visualize the inter-relationships between the concepts and/or objects the domain is composed of. Features such as importing files and data from other applications as nodes, abstraction of the details by grouping, multiple view support for maps and nodes, and stjde support make ReMemex more powerful than traditional tools. The base implementation of ReMemex ha.s been developed in Java as a flexible and extensible Object Oriented API.Alternate abstract:Bilgi Çağı insanları, bilginin inşaasmda; toplamada, çözümlemede, sentezlemede ve düzenlemede vasıflı olmalıdır. Bu vasfa sahip olmaya yönelik talepler eğitimsel teknoloji araştırmalarını yeni teoriler ve uygulamalar bulmaya yönlendirmektedir. Gelişen bir öğrenme teorisi olarak Konstrüktivizm (constructivism), yeni bakış açıları önermekte ve bunun yakın gelecekte eğitim üzerinde büyük etkisi olması beklenmektedir. Bugün, artan çabalara rağmen, konstrüktivist fikirlerin eğitim yazılımlarına en iyi ne şekilde uygulanacağına karar vermek ve etkisinin olup olmadığını ispatlamak için yeterince araştırmaya ihtiyaç hala vardır. Bu tez, bilgi işçilerinin bilgiyi toplama ve düzenlemesine yardım eden ve konstrüktivist öğrenme teorisinin eğitimsel yazılımlara uygulanması konusunda araştırmalar için bir taban teşkil eden ReMemex sistemini, bir yazılım aracını sunmaktadır. ReMemex, öğrenen konumundaki kişilerin kavramlar ve/veya nesneler arasındaki ilişkileri görselleştirmek için bilgi peyzajı oluşturdukları bilgi inşaa ve düzenleme ortamları için bir çatıdır. Diğer uygulamalardan aktarılan kütük ve verilerin düğümler şeklinde gösterilmesi, detayların gruplama 3mlu.yla so3aıtlanması, haritalar ve düğümler için çoklu-görünüş desteği ve biçem desteği gibi özelliklerin tamamı ReMemex sistemini geleneksel araçlcirdan daha güçlü kılmaktadır. ReMemex sisteminin temel gerçekleştirimi Java kullanılarak, esnek ve geliştirme3'e açık. Nesneye Yönelik Uygulama Programı Ara3'üzü (API) olarak yapılmıştır.

T1  - Interdisciplinary Curriculum Integration and Concept Mapping
AN  - 2560852254
AB  - This study was undertaken to assess the effectiveness of interdisciplinary instruction in tenth grade classes studying substance abuse, with a focus on how interdisciplinary instruction might influence students' mental representation of the subject matter as reflected in concept maps. Following the completion of a unit on substance abuse, thirty-two tenth grade females in interdisciplinary classes, which included biology, English, health occupations and social studies, and twenty-two tenth grade female students in regular health classes completed three tasks that measured their knowledge of substance abuse, a concept mapping activity, an objective test and an essay.Results of statistical analyses indicated that the use of interdisciplinary curriculum improved student scores on the concept mapping activity, objective test, and essay. It was found that: (a) there were more mental connections made on the concept maps by students in the interdisciplinary program; (b) the organization of these concepts was more coherent among students in the interdisciplinary program; and (c) the mean score of the objective test was significantly higher for students in the interdisciplinary program. Also, a qualitative analysis of the written essays found that (d) while students in regular health classes missed much of the curriculum and relied largely on experiential information from outside the curriculum to support their arguments in the essays, students in the interdisciplinary programs relied on specific information covered in the course content; and it also found that (e) the essays in interdisciplinary classes demonstrated more mental connections between concepts than the essays of the regular health classes. The results provided insight into the positive effects of integrated instruction on students' mental representation of knowledge and support for interdisciplinary instruction at the secondary level.

T1  - Investigation of biology students' cognitive structure through word association tests, mind maps and structural communication grids
AN  - 1874563448
AB  - The primary aim of this research study was to investigate the cognitive structure (i.e. the relationship between concepts in mind) of biology students/pupils. Three techniques, namely Word Association Tests (in the topic "Genetics"), Mind Maps (in the topic "Seed Structure") and Structural Communication Grids (in the topics "Food Digestion, Chemistry of Respiration and Haemophilia") were used for this purpose. Furthermore, it was also planned to investigate the effect of some psychological factors (i.e. Field Dependence/Field Independence, Convergence/Divergence and Working Memory Capacity) on the relationship between concepts in students' long term memory as well as to reveal the relationship between these three psychological factors. 101 pupils at Higher Grade Biology (age 16-17) from four different secondary schools in the Central Belt of Scotland and around 400 first year biology students in Glasgow University have participated in this research. The results of the word association test (WAT) showed that students generated many ideas related to given key words. However, the results of both maps (in order to map the structures, relatedness coefficient values and response frequencies were used) clearly revealed that the ideas about genetics clustered as only a few isolated islands in students' cognitive structure and they did not appear to see the overall picture as a network of related ideas. In terms of the relationship between psychological factors and the WAT, only the Convergence/Divergence thinking style showed a significant relationship with the WAT. That is, students who had divergent thinking style gave a larger total number of responses and a wider range of responses to the key words in the WAT than the students who had convergent thinking style. Mind maps were used in this research study as an alternative to a linear way of planning essay writing and also to gain an insight into students' ideas lodged in cognitive structure. The results showed that there was a statistically significant difference (in favour of mind mappers) between essay (on Seed Germination) marks of mind mappers and non-mind mappers. A statistically significant correlation between mind map scores and essay scores also appeared, indicating that students who drew better mind maps, had higher scores in essays. The examination of mind maps and the essays of the students also revealed that some students did not mention the same major ideas in their maps and in their essays. In addition, some misconceptions appeared in the students' mind maps as well as in their essays. In terms of the effect of psychological factors on mind mapping (only Convergence/Divergence thinking styles were examined), the mind maps of divergent students were more complex and branched than those of convergent students. For the secondary schools, the results of Structural Communication Grids (SCG) showed that pupils had misconceptions about the topics of "Food Digestion and the Chemistry of Respiration." SCG were also used as an evaluation tool for the first year biology students on the topic "Haemophilia." The effect of some psychological factors (i.e. Field Dependence/Field Independence and Convergence/Divergence) were also examined. The results revealed that overall performance of the field independent pupils in the grids was better than field dependent pupils. Pupils/students who had a divergent thinking style had higher scores than the pupils/students who had a convergent thinking style on grid questions. All results of these three techniques (i.e. word association tests, mind maps and structural communication grids) showed that they are very effective as diagnostic tools to illuminate the relationship between ideas in the long term memory of the students/pupils. Structural communication grids are also effective assessment tools. Implications for using these three techniques in the classroom as well as a self instructional method for students and as a supplement to the exams are also discussed.

T1  - Mothers' and fathers' responses to SIDS
AN  - 304507948
AB  - The goal of this study was to learn more about how mothers and fathers deal with the death of a baby from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. Lists of the ways mothers and fathers responded after the baby's death were collected in response to an open ended question in the form of (i) mailed out questionnaires, (ii) interviews, and (iii) telephone interviews. Using the method of concept mapping, each list of statements was analysed into ten themes. The ten themes found for mothers were (i) getting and sharing information, (ii) finding out that I am not alone, (iii) coming to terms with the baby's death, (iv) looking forward to a new baby, (v) doing normal things, (vi) putting it out of my mind, (vii) questioning beliefs, (viii) remembering the baby, (ix) getting comfort through being alone, and (x) being sad, angry and grieving. The ten themes for fathers were (i) talking, (ii) getting support from others, (iii) trying not to think about it, (iv) seeking comfort and understanding, (v) distancing, (vi) feeling fear and helplessness, (vii) being sad and depressed, (viii) accepting the baby lived and died, (ix) remembering the baby, and (x) seeking closure.    Mothers and fathers reported a variety of statements. Seventy percent of the statements were shared by both parents: 30% reflected gender biases and individual differences. The recovery processes for mothers included grieving, making changes, getting on with life, and remembering the baby. For fathers, the recovery process included grieving, accepting the baby's death, and making changes. Both parents experienced much pain and sadness. Fathers did talk. Mothers sought professional help and for some, having another baby was part of the recovery process. Guilt was not theme in this study.

T1  - The effectiveness of learning with concept mapping on the science problem-solving of sixth-grade children
AN  - 304504334
AB  - The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship of concept mapping to science problem solving in sixth grade elementary school children. The study proposes to determine whether the students' ability to perform higher cognitive processes was a predictor of students' performance in solving problems in science and whether gender and socioeconomic status are related to performance in solving problems.    Two groups participated in the study. Both groups were given a pre-test of higher cognitive ability--the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Ability. One group received instruction on a science unit of study in concept mapping format and the other group received instruction in traditional format. The instruction lasted approximately 4 weeks. Both groups were given a problem-solving post-test. A comparison of post-test means was done using Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) as the statistical procedure with scores on the test of higher cognitive ability as the covariate. Also, Multiple Regression was performed to analyze the influence of participants' gender and socioeconomic status on their performance in solving problems.    Results from the analysis of covariance showed that the group receiving instruction in the concept mapping format performed significantly better than the group receiving instruction in traditional format. Also the Ross Test of Higher Cognitive Processes emerged to be a predictor of performance on problem solving. There was no significant difference in the analysis of the performance of males and females. No pattern emerged regarding the influence of socioeconomic status on problem solving performance. In conclusion, the study showed that concept mapping improved problem solving in the classroom, and that gender and socioeconomic status are not predictors of student success in problem solving.

T1  - Concept mapping in evaluation practice and theory: A synthesis of current empirical research
AN  - 304488106
AB  - Concept mapping is a conceptualization process that can be used by individuals and groups to develop conceptual frameworks which can guide evaluations and planning (Trochim, 1989). In research, these processes display individual and group representations of concepts about particular domains, illustrating potential relationships among them (Miles, 1994). Cognitive mapping processes involve the acquisition, store, access and utilization of spacial knowledge (Golledge, 1986). Empirical research using concept mapping technology has proliferated within the past fifteen years. Investigation of this research has revealed the existence of a wide variation of domains of inquiry and applications of concept mapping. Using non-traditional meta-analytic research techniques employed in prior reviews by Cousins and associates (Cousins, 1996; Cousins & Earl, 1992; Cousins & Leithwood, 1986; Ross, in press) and others (e.g., Leithwood & Montgomery, 1982), the empirical research studies are explored with relevance to evaluation theory and practice. Emphasis on concept mapping process variations and use in evaluation is ordered. This study provides researchers and evaluators with valuable empirical basis from which to make choices regarding selection and applications of concept mapping.

T1  - The effect of the use of concept maps on community college students' conceptual understanding of biology course content
AN  - 304485689
AB  - Purpose of the study. The major purpose of this study was to measure the change, if any, in students' conceptual understanding of biology course content using concept maps (experimental) or a standard lecture format (control). In addition, the effectiveness of the use of concept maps as advance organizers was measured according to the various subgroups of cognitive development level, age, ethnicity, gender, class time, and educational background. A final concern was the relationships between conceptual understanding of biology course content and the students' cognitive development level.    Procedure. A quasi-experimental design was used to conduct the study during a sixteen-week semester. The study was conducted during the fall, 1997, semester at a community college using 190 students enrolled in General Biology 1406. Major data were collected using a pretest, posttest, and the Test of Logical Thinking. Data were treated through the application of analysis of covariance, Pearson product-moment correlation, and the Fisher Z-transformation technique.    Findings. The findings of this investigation were as follows: (1) Concept maps used as advance organizers had a significant effect on student conceptual understanding of biology course content. (2) The use of concept maps as advance organizers had a significant effect on student conceptual understanding of biology when students are classified according to their cognitive developmental level, age, gender, major, course time, and educational background. (3) A significant relationship between cognitive developmental level and conceptual understanding was also found.    Conclusions. The use of concept maps, as advance Organizers, is an effective method for improving student learning in general biology classes. A positive relationship exists between students' cognitive developmental level and conceptual understanding.

T1  - An investigation of the use of concept mapping in teaching and learning cellular respiration in a Vietnamese university
AN  - 304482623
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate biology students' understandings of cellular respiration at Cantho University. The study was designed to achieve two goals: (1) to determine students' understandings, before and after instruction, of various concepts and their relationships in the domain of cellular respiration, (2) to investigate how students restructure their conceptual frameworks related to cellular respiration.    Thirty-one first-year biology major students at Cantho University participated in this study. Students' pre- and post-maps were used to investigate students' understandings of concepts and their relationships in cellular respiration before and after instruction. Pre- and post-maps were compared to determine how students reorganize their conceptual structure. Interviews conducted with nine of the participants were used as a complementary tool for concept mapping. Individual and group interviews focused prior analyses of the concept maps made by the investigator and the study.    The majority of students had undertaken a major reconstruction of their conceptual frameworks by assimilating and accommodating new knowledge into their existing network of concepts.

T1  - Alternative assessment in project-based science classrooms: A study of the content and process demands of an innovative classroom assessment
AN  - 304465119
AB  - This dissertation explored the use of products as assessments in secondary science classrooms in which students explored content through long-term projects. Student performance on the products was compared with several characteristics of the students and of the groups within which they worked, including aspects of content understanding and product construction processes.    To investigate the content understanding demands of product construction, products, tests, and concept maps were collected from the students of three teachers in four ninth-grade classrooms. Correlations, partial correlations, and scatterplots were explored to determine the relationships among student performances on the separate measures. Product scores did not correlate with scores on the test, but did correlate moderately with scores on the concept map. The test, a selected response task, did not match the demands of the product as well as the concept map (a constructed response task). Additionally, a moderate correlation was found between tests and concept map scores. The scatterplot of test and concept map scores revealed that nearly all students with high concept map scores also had high test scores (though the reverse was not true).    To investigate the process demands of product construction, audiotapes of individual and group interviews and videotapes of groups working in class were collected during the two months students worked on their products. These data were analyzed for evidence of three aspects of constructivist learning environments: the development of mastery goal orientation, holistic views of the task, and the nature of the collaboration within the group. Although no groups began the project with mastery goal orientations or holistic views of the task, groups that constructed high quality products were likely to develop these characteristics as their product developed. These groups also reported few difficulties working together.    Results suggest that content understanding was necessary, but not sufficient, for success on products. Success was also dependent upon developing mastery goal orientations, holistic views, and positive group interaction skills. These results provide insight into the demands of product construction and suggest that alternative assessments such as these may be used to evaluate and support the goals of science education reform efforts.

T1  - Athletic pain in competitive swimming
AN  - 304461588
AB  - The athlete who demonstrates a higher pain tolerance in most situations is expected to achieve a higher level of performance than the athlete who possesses a lower level of pain tolerance (Hogg, 1992). This dissertation presents a three-study examination of athletic pain in competitive swimming. The first two studies examined a cognitive-behavioral pain management program for athletes using a single-subject research design. The third study was an in-depth look at the way that competitive swimmers experience pain in their sport and the ways in which they attempt to deal with it. The third study was a phenomenologically based study within a qualitative research design and was conducted with competitive swimmers from a provincial and national competitive level. The global objective of all three studies was to determine if an athlete's ability to tolerate high levels of pain can be improved through a mental skills training program designed specifically for athletes involved in repetitive, aerobically based sports such as running, cycling, or competitive swimming. The results from the first two studies indicated that while the mental skills training did help some of the swimmers improve their performance on the swimming tests and pain tolerance indicators, most of the swimmers did not improve to a statistically significant degree. The third study was designed to re-evaluate the role that pain and the tolerance of pain plays in swimming performance. A phenomenological research method was utilized to gain a greater understanding of pain perception with competitive swimmers. Interview data was analyzed using the concept mapping methodology which resulted in the development of a concept map that included seven pain perception themes: description of pain, experiential effects of pain, coping techniques, importance of mental attitude, the interaction of situational significance, emotional consequences, and acknowledgment of pain in competitive swimming.

T1  - Assessing conceptual ecologies
AN  - 304458696
AB  - In this project, the researcher studied ways in which graduate students in research methods classes combined concepts into meaningful structures called conceptual ecologies (Posner, Strike, Hewson & Gertzog, 1982; Strike & Posner, 1992). Conceptual ecology theory suggests that concepts “adapt to an intellectual environment [prior learning] much as organisms adapt to a biological environment” (Strike & Posner, 1976, p. 111). This is often referred to as “accommodation” (Piaget, 1970) or "restructuring" (Rummelhart & Norman, 1978). This study considered the development of a method for characterizing changes in relationships between concepts, in an attempt to gain insight into each participant's structured knowledge.    The participants of this study developed diagrams and repertory grid matrices that assessed their perceptions of the relationships between concepts related to “research”. The diagrams and matrices suggested a level of development consistent with each participant's level of expertise. The diagrams and matrices also suggested changes to the participants' conceptual ecologies that could best be characterized in terms of structure and shared understanding. However, further research is necessary to answering questions concerning those factors that, on the surface, appear to make the diagrams reflective of unique conceptual ecologies.

T1  - The relationship of multiple intelligences profiles to success in computer-based concept mapping
AN  - 304457654
AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of concepts and their interconnections. Research has shown that concept maps reflect the student's cognitive structure, enabling both teachers and students to determine the level of understanding of material attained before, during or after instruction.    Several studies have determined that the addition of the use of a computer-based concept mapping tool for preparing maps increases the level of complexity of students' maps. However, not all students are successful mappers, whether prepared on a computer or drawn with paper-and-pencil. The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between preservice teachers' multiple intelligences profiles, as defined by the work of Howard Gardner (1983), and the levels of complexity in their computer-based concept maps.    This study was conducted with preservice teachers (N = 20) enrolled in a science methods course at a northeastern university graduate program. After an initial questionnaire to determine their computer and academic background and prior exposure to concept mapping, students received instruction on how to develop concept maps and on how to create concept maps using the computer-based concept mapping tool, Inspiration$\sp\circler.$ They completed the MIDAS instrument to determine their individual intelligence profiles. A unit on the 'Phases of the Moon' was taught, after which the subjects took a paper-and-pencil test and then prepared computer-based concept maps of their understanding of the material.    The findings in the study substantiated the hypothesis that strengths in multiple intelligences were predictive of success in concept mapping. Using the Pearson product-moment correlation, one intelligence, musical-rhythmic, produced a significant correlation (r = 0.54, p $\le$ 5.05) with the level of complexity in the preservice teachers' concept maps. Ability in music and success in concept mapping both require higher order thinking skills, suggesting that success in concept mapping can be increased among students, when concept mapping is used consciously to develop higher order thinking. Ascertaining students' multiple intelligences profiles can increase teachers' understanding of their cognitive abilities and shed light upon the underlying influences in cognitive tasks such as concept mapping.

T1  - The use of guided free and formal journal writing in the development of conceptual change in ninth-grade Earth science students as measured using concept maps and achievement tests
AN  - 304445768
AB  - The problem for this study is stated as follows. Does using guided free and formal journal writing affect a positive increase in conceptual change in science for ninth grade Earth science students when compared to ninth grade Earth science students not using guided free and formal journal writing?    During one semester of work, an experimental group of 29 students used guided freewriting and formal writing of a summary in their journals. A control group of 29 students did not use journals during the same semester of study. Students within the experimental group spent five minutes at the end of each class for guided freewriting about concepts presented that day. On Friday of each week or at the close of a unit, students spent 15 minutes formally writing about the week's work.    Students in both groups began each unit of study by creating a concept map and taking a pre-achievement test. At the close of each unit, students in both groups created a concept map and took a post-achievement test.    In all four units of study, the amount of increase in the means from pre- to post-concept map scores for the experimental group was significantly greater (p $<$ 0.001) than the increase in the means from pre- to post-concept map scores for the control group.    Conceptual change was significantly greater for students in the experimental group when compared to conceptual change for students in the control group because of the use of guided freewriting and weekly formal writing in their science journals. The data was analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. The test yielded a significant interaction at p $<$ 0.001 whereby guided free and formal journal writing did affect a positive increase in conceptual change in science for ninth grade Earth science students when compared to ninth grade Earth science students not using guided free and formal journal writing.

T1  - Children as scientists: Adding, connecting and elaborating ideas on the way to conceptual development
AN  - 304443738
AB  - In this study, I explored how children develop and construct their ideas and alternative frameworks in science. Prior work in this area suggested that changes from alternative conceptions to understandings that more closely resemble scientists' models do not occur in a sequential, linear fashion, nor are they easily accomplished. By employing a constructivist framework grounded in dynamic systems to look at learning, alternative conceptions were viewed not as ideas that need to be “confronted and replaced” but rather as pieces of an intricate puzzle of understanding that when combined create a more complete, functional, continuous understanding of science. Specifically, the study examined students' understandings and conceptualizations of light as they studied it formally for eight weeks. Understandings were measured through interviews, student-generated concept maps, classroom interactions and by examining student work samples. The central questions guiding the investigation were: What were children's (ages 9 and 10) conceptions of light? Did children's ideas about light develop during their eight week study of it? If so, what was the nature of these changes? Results from the study indicated that children had numerous ideas about light before their formal study of it based on their experiences with the world. As children studied light, they learned about it in the dynamic, synergistic and interactive processes of adding new ideas, connecting ideas to one another and elaborating understandings to arrive at progressively more complex and scientific understandings of light. Alternative conceptions, served as both productive and non-productive resources for learning. Further, alternative conceptions and prior understandings did not disappear as children developed their ideas about light. Rather “old” ideas were used and reused to provide support the gradual process of cognitive development of children's ideas about light. Findings from this study can be used to provide science instruction that is both rich in content and rich in opportunities to experience the recursive and dynamic nature of science learning.

T1  - Reducing task-related variance in performance assessment using concept maps
AN  - 304443062
AB  - Task-related variance causes scores from performance assessments not to be generalizable and thus inappropriate for high stakes use. It is possible that task-related variance is due, in part, to students' inability to transfer their knowledge consistently from one assessment task to another. If this is so, then a cognitive tool such as a concept map might be useful.    This study examines the effects of concept maps on the task-related variance components of Political Science performance assessments. On three in-class graded exercises, some students used concept maps while writing two essays, while other students did not. The task variance components remained unchanged across groups, but the subject main effect components increased and the subject-by-task interaction components decreased. Also, the scores from the concept mapping groups had higher generalizability coefficients than for those who did not use a concept map.

T1  - Conceptual development and retention within the learning cycle
AN  - 304442781
AB  - This research was designed to achieve two goals: (1) examine concept development and retention within the learning cycle and (2) examine how students' concept development is mediated by classroom discussions and the students' small cooperative learning group. Forty-eight sixth-grade students and one teacher at an urban middle school participated in the study. The research utilized both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Quantitative assessments included a concept mapping technique as well as teacher generated multiple choice tests. Preliminary quantitative analysis found that students' reading levels had an effect on students' pretest scores in both the concept mapping and the multiple-choice assessment. Therefore, a covariant design was implemented for the quantitative analyses.    Quantitative analysis techniques were used to examine concept development and retention, it was discovered that the students' concept knowledge increased significantly from the time of the conclusion of the term introduction phase to the conclusion of the expansion phase. These findings would indicate that all three phases of the learning cycle are necessary for conceptual development. However, quantitative analyses of concept maps indicated that this is not true for all students. Individual students showed evidence of concept development and integration at each phase. Therefore, concept development is individualized and all phases of the learning cycle are not necessary for all students. As a result, individual's assimilation, disequilibration, accommodation and organization may not correlate with the phases of the learning cycle. Quantitative analysis also indicated a significant decrease in the retention of concepts over time.    Qualitative analyses were used to examine how students' concept development is mediated by classroom discussions and the students' small cooperative learning group. It was discovered that there was a correlation between teacher-student interaction and small-group interaction and concept mediation. Therefore, students who had a high level of teacher-student dialogue which utilized teacher led discussions with integrated scaffolding techniques where the same students who mediated the ideas within the small group discussions. Those students whose teacher-student interactions consisted of dialogue with little positive teacher feedback made no contributions within the small group regardless of their level of concept development.

T1  - Learning to learn strategies of successful real-estate professionals: Implications for continuing professional education
AN  - 304441970
AB  - The primary purpose of the research was to illuminate how licensed real-estate professionals learn to learn to remain competitive and successful in the real-estate business. The secondary purpose was to relate the implications of the research to continuing professional education.    A review of the literature revealed that no theory or concept existed that explained how professionals learn in the real-estate business.    The qualitative methodology of interpretative case study was employed to examine and compare how professionals learn to learn in the major areas of the business: residential sales, property management, and appraisal.    Three exemplar professionals were purposely selected. They were interviewed and studied by the researcher. The data was analyzed by use of concept maps. The data was validated through observation by the researcher, tapes, literature, and other documents.    The first theme described how the interviewees learn as a model of an "individual learning system."    The second theme listed the strategies interviewees utilized to stay competitive in the business: self-awareness, self-monitoring, reflection, reflection-in-action, self-direction, lifelong learning, a seven-step problem-solving model, expertise, networking, inter-personal skills, personal motivation, innovation, collaboration, and technology.    The third theme discussed resources professionals employed for success: mentors, experts, professional associations, technology, relationships, and supportive organizations.    The fourth theme supported the development of Total Quality Management Learning Organizations to provide services and education programs for professionals.    The fifth theme described competencies needed by educators. Educators must possess teaching experience and knowledge about content, use a variety of instructional methods, understand needs and characteristics of students, and conduct evaluations.    The last theme explained how to improve continuing education programs. Courses must provide relevant information, offer a variety of subjects and delivery methods, be updated regularly, be cost effective, and be timely.    Two other important findings emerged from the study. First, organizations should regularly survey professionals to evaluate their services. Second, interviewees expressed how women and men learn differently in the business. More research could substantiate the results and add to the literature on the subject.

T1  - A study of concept maps regarding the nature of science by preservice secondary science teachers
AN  - 304438075
AB  - An adequate understanding and conception of the nature of science is one of the important outcomes of science education (American Association for the Advancement of Science, 1989, 1993; National Research Council, 1996; Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990). Many studies in science education have investigated teachers' conceptions of the nature of science. Most studies have shown that teachers have inadequate or naive conceptions of the nature of science.    This study investigated preservice secondary science teachers' conceptions of the nature of science in a college level secondary science methods course by using concept mapping. In addition, three pre and post surveys were used: Survey Statements of the Nature of Science, Science Beliefs Questionnaire and The Nature and Implications of Science/Technology.    From the results of this study, preservice teachers' concept maps showed a statistically significant gain in acceptable concepts, vertical links, levels of hierarchy and total scores of acceptable components. These results indicated their growth and/or development conceptions regarding the nature of science. Concept mapping exercises helped preservice teachers recognize and modify their knowledge structures regarding the nature of science.    The cognitive development from concept mapping exercises did not significantly affect the results of surveys, however. By investigating the scores of survey items of SSNOS, NIST and SBQ, the researcher concluded that only SSNOS was useful in measuring some of their growth resulted from the concept mapping activities. Particularly, two of the six models by SSNOS, Scientific Laws and General Concerns, indicated statistically significant growth on the part of students from Traditional to Mixed Views of the nature of science. The majority of preservice teachers still held Mixed Views of Role of a Scientist (80%) and General Concerns (93%) on the posttest. Many preservice teachers believed that scientists work independently from the scientific community. They did not understand that scientific laws are the invention of scientists. On the posttest, they still believed science is a body of knowledge rather than a method. They understood science as consisting of conceptual knowledge, not as including procedural knowledge. Therefore, the researcher concluded from SSNOS model analysis that preservice teachers need more help to gain an adequate conceptions regarding the Role of a Scientist, Scientific Method and General Concerns models of the nature of science.    Although the development in acceptable components of concept maps, responses on the three models of NIST and the five models of SBQ did not change during the semester. On the NIST posttest, only the Social Implication model showed the increasing achievement compared to the others. However, the pretest means for items of the Nature of Science model indicated preservice teachers already had good understanding at the beginning of the course, and was maintained on the posttest also. On the SBQ posttest, only Theoretical Emphasis and Balanced View models showed statistically significant changes toward more balanced views of science. These results suggest that beliefs on the nature of science were hard to change within a 16-week long semester. Individual item inspection of SSNOS, SBQ and NIST indicated that preservice teachers did not have acceptable conceptions of scientific methods. Students need learning experiences that will help them construct an appropriate understanding of this aspect of the nature of science.

T1  - Ways of thinking about data
AN  - 304436971
AB  - Within a larger frame concerning how ordinary people learn to use complex tools, database software was selected as the archetypical tool of the knowledge worker in the Information Age. As non-technical professionals, how do knowledge workers learn the complex technology of databases?    The disciplines of education, software engineering, and cognitive anthropology grounded the study in a guiding perspective of the learner, seeking ways to improve how tools can support learners' efforts to use them, as opposed to how learners can be fixed to better use the tools.    The evolving methodology of phenomenography (Marton & Booth, 1997) makes the basic assumption that the conceptions people hold differentially affect how they approach tasks and the outcomes they achieve. Accordingly, the study sought to clarify the conceptions people hold around learning, data, and database software. Given a theoretical framework of situated and distributed cognition, these conceptions are better studied under conditions of work rather than laboratory. So, evidence was gathered from an ongoing work setting, a class of students learning how to teach others about business software, and from the tools themselves. These considerations were brought to bear on the operational research question: what ways of thinking about data-related concepts do practitioners exhibit that may affect their design of work activity?    Using concept mapping as a primary data transformation tool, the study found that data can be seen as a hierarchy of conceptions--content, attributes, structure, and purpose--the thrust of which is the development of meaning on a foundation of content, which is a parallel construction with knowledge.    These findings are used to suggest that business education curriculum should thoroughly encompass purposes. Content classifications are suggested that go beyond the practice of teaching how to activate the decontextualized functional aspects of the software.    The findings suggest that software tools should support a distributed cognition view of the workplace. A development methodology is proposed that casts software development as the relocation of cognitions in a cognitive network. One possible direction is to develop a process metaphor to expand the now standard desktop metaphor for software interfaces.

T1  - The multidimensionality of body experience: Mapping the domain
AN  - 304436643
AB  - Although there is little agreement on the exact definition of the term "body experience" (also called body image), it encompasses a broad spectrum of dimensions including feelings, thoughts, perceptions, awareness, and behaviors related to various aspects of the body, such as appearance, fitness, health, illness, sexuality, weight, and bodily sensations. While research on body experience has increased in recent years, there is no clear consensus as to what constitutes the relevant dimensions of body experience. This confusion is demonstrated by the large number of questionnaires currently available to assess its various facets. Before developing more instruments that are purported to assess a new or refined aspect of body experience, we need to have a better understanding of those that are presently available. The purpose of this investigation was to conduct a systematic examination of body experience assessment instruments. Two key questions were: "What do they measure?" and "How do they relate to one another?" The methodology of Concept Mapping was used to develop a taxonomy of several of the most commonly used body experience questionnaires and to depict relations among various dimensions of body experience. One key implication of this investigation was that categorizing body experience questionnaires according to bodily domain is a reliable and useful taxonomic system that has not been used in previous systems of classification of available instruments. A second implication is that the Concept Mapping approach to classification has more validity and reliability than the previous systems for classifying body experience questionnaires. A third implication is that when the most commonly used body image questionnaires are completed by women, the results are strongly influenced by their feelings about their body weight. The terminology used in categorizing body experience questionnaires has not reflected this emphasis, however. Ideally, this investigation may foster clearer and more consistent use of terminology used to describe and classify the various instruments for assessing body experience.

T1  - A study of the impact of a supplemental storytelling (oral narrative) strategy on fourth-grade students' understanding of the physics of sound
AN  - 304432638
AB  - In this study the effect of story-telling (oral-narrative) strategies on student understanding of ideas about the physics of sound was investigated. A midwestern 4th grade sample of convenience was selected for this study. An experienced elementary science teacher with a special interest and talent for the oral tradition of storytelling taught a commercially available sound unit to two separate groups of students. In one group (the treatment, n = 27), he complemented the hands-on activities prescribed for the unit with special oral narrative activities; in the second group (the comparison, n = 27), he used only the prescribed hands-on activities. The treatment was designed to determine the extent to which students change in science understanding through narrative practice, and to determine the extent to which students can incorporate increasingly complex science content into narratives. Students in both groups wrote individual directed journals containing explanations of the science ideas encountered in the lessons. The only difference was that the treatment group had an opportunity to incorporate the unit science concepts with the narrative during the morning literacy program. An analysis of student responses to an open-ended question focusing on the big ideas of the sound unit prior to the start of the unit showed that the treatment and comparison groups were equivalent in their understanding of the big ideas.    Four oral narratives were told, one pre-unit oral narrative and one oral narrative following each of the three science lessons. Special rubrics were developed to generate quantitative data on the students' pre- unit and post-unit assessing, journal writing, story boarding, concept listing, concept mapping, and story telling performance. A t-test analysis of a post-unit test of student understanding showed students in the treatment group outperformed students in the comparison group $(p < 0.001).$ ANOVA data on the four narratives written by the seven cooperative, groups in the treatment group showed that the stories grew in complexity throughout the unit $(p < 0.001).$ A regression analysis on the story telling activity scores on the final story scores showed that performance on the story telling activities predicted final story complexity.

T1  - The effects of a shared, Intranet science learning environment on the academic behaviors of problem-solving and metacognitive reflection
AN  - 304432259
AB  - This study investigated the effects of a shared, Intranet science environment on the academic behaviors of problem-solving and metacognitive reflection. Seventy-eight subjects included 9th and 10th grade male and female biology students. A quasi-experimental design with pre- and post-test data collection and randomization occurring through assignment of biology classes to traditional or shared, Intranet learning groups was employed. Pilot, web-based distance education software (CourseInfo) created the Intranet learning environment. A modified ecology curriculum provided contextualization and content for traditional and shared learning environments.    The effect of this environment on problem-solving, was measured using the standardized Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal test. Metacognitive reflection, was measured in three ways: (a) number of concepts used, (b) number of concept links noted, and (c) number of concept nodes noted. Visual learning software, Inspiration, generated concept maps. Secondary research questions evaluated the pilot CourseInfo software for (a) tracked user movement, (b) discussion forum findings, and (c) difficulties experienced using CourseInfo software.    Analysis of problem-solving group means reached no levels of significance resulting from the shared, Intranet environment. Paired t-Test of individual differences in problem-solving reached levels of significance.    Analysis of metacognitive reflection by number of concepts reached levels of significance. Metacognitive reflection by number of concept links noted also reach significance. No significance was found for metacognitive reflection by number of concept nodes. No gender differences in problem-solving ability and metacognitive reflection emerged.    Lack of gender differences in the shared, Intranet environment strongly suggests an equalizing effect due to the cooperative, collaborative nature of Intranet environments. Such environments appeal to, and rank high with, the female gender.    Tracking learner movements in web-based, science environments has metacognitive and problem-solving learner implications. CourseInfo software offers one method of informing instruction within web-based learning environments focusing on academic behaviors.    A shared, technology-supported learning environment may pose one model which science classrooms can use to create equitable scientific study across gender. The lack of significant differences resulting from this environment presents one model for improvement of individual problem-solving ability and metacognitive reflection across gender.

T1  - A case study of meaningful learning in a collaborative concept mapping strategy as a preparation for a college biology laboratory
AN  - 304432095
AB  - Statement of the problem. The purpose of this research was to add to our understanding of meaningful learning by examining the process of collaborative concept mapping and student interaction during knowledge construction. Laboratory learning has been hampered by inadequacies of students' conceptual understanding and laboratory preparation. Believing that people construct their own knowledge and that collaboration might assist in these constructions, this research examined student dialog and written products related to their college general biology laboratory experiences.    The following questions guided the research: (a) What negotiations and other interactions take place between students who jointly construct propositions and concept maps? (b) What thinking and understanding takes place as students are constructing biology concepts? (c) What awareness do students have about their construction of biological concepts and about the use of these concept mapping strategies?    Method. This study utilized qualitative and interpretive methodologies and a case study approach with purposeful sampling. Students in college general biology laboratory used an instructional strategy in which they independently constructed propositions from laboratory concepts. While being audio taped, pairs of students negotiated these propositions and used them to form concept maps. The data sets resulting from these methods, solicited personal documents including written proposition lists, concept maps, and examinations, were examined along with tape recorded conversations.    Results. Analysis of interaction data revealed that most students paid only moderate attention to each other's comments. Most commonly observed cooperative behaviors were seeking meaning, providing explanations, and completion of partner's statements. The degree of pair symmetry did not consistently influence student interactions or cooperative behaviors. Students used easily memorized, but not necessarily accurate, answers. They had difficulty in focusing on abstract concepts and in forming explicit relationships. They also had difficulty with the hierarchial nature of concept maps. Students seeking improved study habits perceived that there was value to these activities.    Conclusions. Emphasis on proposition formation prior to concept map construction was shown to effectively aid knowledge construction especially in relatively balanced student pairs. The theoretical framework of constructivism, concept mapping, and collaboration jointly provided a synergistic referent for understanding the complexity of meaningful learning.

T1  - Conquering the perfect girl myth: Achievement based role models and adolescent girls
AN  - 304429056
AB  - Adolescence is not an easy time for girls, they experience eating disorders, depression, negative body image and suicide attempts at a significantly greater rate than their male peers. Brown and Gilligan (1992) talked with hundreds of adolescent girls and found that many girls imagine a mythical "perfect girl" whose unattainable and unrealizable characteristics contributes to the disintegration of their own voices and hopes. This research seeks to identify intervention factors that might help girls resist the "perfect girl" images that surround them.    The hypothesis is that by making a young girl familiar with women who are accomplished in the worlds of business, science, law, sports or letters, she will improve her achievement orientation, reduce personal anxiety (worries), and reach a better understanding of how her life can be linked to adult accomplishments. The research uses Sheroes!, a 37 minute video created by the author, that draws examples from interviews with 120 accomplished American women. By proxy, the women candidly discuss their accomplishments and reflect on their adolescence.    The short term effect of watching Sheroes! was measured in a group of seventh grade girls at Lansing Middle School in Lansing, New York. During the experiment both control and experimental groups were pre-tested for self-esteem and self-concept. Concept mapping was used to express and then assess changes in cognitive structure. It was expected that the control group's pre and post maps would remain stable, while the experimental group's maps would show change in a positive manner. The study shows that viewing Sheroes! had a measurable effect. Analysis of the data for the five dependent variables revealed significant differences in the pre and post maps for the experimental group in the direction predicted for three of the variables, and a trend in a positive direction for a fourth.    Sheroes!, or its equivalent, has promise as a means to provide role concepts for girls as they struggle with popular culture and the pressures of adolescence. The research results suggest that even though it is a minimal intervention, exposing girls to the authentic voices of real women has a significant cognitive impact.

T1  - The nature of undergraduates' conceptual understanding of oxygen transport and utilization in humans: Can cardiopulmonary simulation software enhance learning of propositional knowledge and/or diagnose alternative conceptions in novices and intermediates?
AN  - 304426911
AB  - The purpose of the this research was to explore undergraduates' conceptual development for oxygen transport and utilization, as a component of a cardiopulmonary physiology and advanced respiratory care course in the allied health program. This exploration focused on the student's development of knowledge and the presence of alternative conceptions, prior to, during, and after completing cardiopulmonary physiology and advanced respiratory care courses. Using the simulation program, SimBioSysTM (Samsel, 1994), student-participants completed a series of laboratory exercises focusing on cardiopulmonary disease states. This study examined data gathered from: (1) a novice group receiving the simulation program prior to instruction, (2) a novice group that experienced the simulation program following  course completion in cardiopulmonary physiology, and (3) an intermediate group who experienced the simulation program following completion of formal education in Respiratory Care.    This research was based on the theory of Human Constructivism as described by Mintzes, Wandersee, and Novak (1997). Data-gathering techniques were based on theories supported by Novak (1984), Wandersee (1997), and Chi (1997). Data were generated by exams, interviews, verbal analysis (Chi, 1997), and concept mapping.    Results suggest that simulation may be an effective instructional method for assessing conceptual development and diagnosing alternative conceptions in undergraduates enrolled in a cardiopulmonary science program. Use of simulation in conjunction with clinical interview and concept mapping may assist in verifying gaps in learning and conceptual knowledge. This study found only limited evidence to support the use of computer simulation prior to lecture to augment learning. However, it was demonstrated that students' prelecture experience with the computer simulation helped the instructor assess what the learner knew so he or she could be taught accordingly. In addition, use of computer simulation after formal instruction was shown to be useful in aiding students identified by the instructor as needing remediation.

T1  - The effects of feedback cues, relevant information, and scoring procedures on concept mapping performance
AN  - 304425860
AB  - The effects of different types of feedback and scoring algorithms on concept mapping performance were investigated. Four hundred and sixty-five undergraduate life science students studying genetics participated. Students were randomly assigned to one of eight groups in a 2 x 2 x 2 experimental design. The topic was mitosis and meiosis. All concept mapping data were collected on the computer. There were two different contrasting approaches to scoring of concept map data, two levels of access to additional information about the concepts, and two different cues given to subjects regarding the meaning of the feedback they were presented. The two scoring algorithms represent theoretically distinct approaches to providing feedback to students. One scoring method comes from a traditional static conceptualization of cognitive structure while the other scoring method relies upon a mathematical modeling procedure derived from macro dynamic system theory. Both scoring procedures used the same composite expert criterion. Students were either provided with strategic (outcome) feedback cueing, or they were given cognitive feedback cueing.    Significant differences were found for the type of feedback cueing presented to students. Students who were presented with cognitive outscored those given outcome feedback. Additional analyses revealed that students who had less relevant prior knowledge of the topic area profited from cognitive feedback and access to additional information on concepts. Students with high prior knowledge did better on the mapping task when they had access to additional relevant information. No significant differences were found from scoring procedures.    The results of this research are discussed in light of the limitations and implications of the study. One outcome of the study is that concept maps have become a regular part of the instructional experience for students of this course at this major four-year university. Continuing research that builds on this study is also described.

T1  - An exploration of students' personal constructs: Implications for clinical teaching in psychiatric mental health nursing
AN  - 304422586
AB  - Despite revolutionary rhetoric in the nursing education literature calling for collaborative student centered learning, few opportunities actually exist, particularly in the psychiatric clinical teaching area, to include the voices of student nurses in the scholarly dialogue surrounding their learning. This thesis was designed to understand students' own ways of knowing during their six-week mental health practicums on acute hospital units. A constructivist conceptual perspective and George Kelly's personal construct psychology are the theoretical bases of the research. Qualitative methodology using the case study approach was used to describe the experiences of six Canadian second year nursing students from their own perspectives. Data sources included before and after repertory grids, a questionnaire and audiotape-recorded transcribed interviews. Content was theme analyzed, Vee Heuristic diagramed and concept mapped. The case studies were written collaboratively with students and member checking by correspondence six months after the practicum ended confirmed that the reports authentically narrated the personal construct changes which occurred, or did not occur, as a result of the course. The study spanned three years, included a pilot project and incorporated the resulting student "stories" into a clinical curriculum. The case reports are snapshot portrayals of how student nurses construed the professional activities they observed on hospital units which recently underwent organizational changes. They reflect human faces behind the paradigm shifts occurring in nursing education and health care. The following four overarching themes represent key findings. The research approach invited constructivist teaching. Students' anxiety related more to feeling unable to help than to mentally ill patients. Students felt a lack of inclusion in staff nurse groups. Non evaluated student-instructor discussion time was vitally important. Suggestions for clinical teaching strategies are made to assist instructors in the selection of experiences which can help link university curricula to hospital practicum sites. The research contributes to the conceptualization of how students learn nursing by re-valuing what they bring to clinical experiences, by increasing understanding of what students find engaging or difficult and by developing a pedagogical mode of inquiry which extends clinical instruction beyond demonstration and evaluation to creating a space for student perceptions.

T1  - The use of metacognitive tools in a multidimensional research program
AN  - 304418775
AB  - Metacognition may be thought of as "cognition about cognition", or "thinking about thinking." A number of strategies and tools have been developed to help individuals understand the nature of knowledge, and to enhance their "thinking about thinking." Two metacognitive tools, concept maps and Gowin's Vee, were first developed for use in educational research. Subsequently, they were used successfully to help learners "learn how to learn."    The success of metacognitive tools in educational settings suggests that they may help scientists understand the nature of knowledge production and organization, thereby facilitating their research activities and enhancing their understanding of the events and objects they study.    In September 1993 I began an ethnographic, naturalistic study of the United States Department of Agriculture - Agricultural Research Service - Rhizobotany Project at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. I spent the next two and one-half years as a participant observer with the Project. The focus of my research was to examine the application of metacognitive tools to an academic research setting.    The knowledge claims that emerged from my research were: (1) Individual researchers tended to have narrow views of the Rhizobotany Project that centered on their individual areas of research; (2) The researchers worked in "conceptual isolation", or failing to see the connections and interrelatedness of their own work with the work of the others; (3) For those researchers who constructed concept maps and Vee diagrams, these heuristics helped them to build a deeper conceptual understanding of their own work; and (4) Half of the members of the research team did not find concept mapping and Vee diagramming useful. Their reluctance to use these tools was interpreted as an indication of epistemological confusion.    The prevalence of conceptual isolation and epistemological confusion among members of the Rhizobotany Project parallels the results of previous studies that have demonstrated the instability and inconsistency of science students' and researchers' epistemological commitments and beliefs.

T1  - The guiding process in discovery hypertext learning environments for the internet
AN  - 301632792
AB  - Hypertext is the dominant method to navigate the Internet, providing user freedom and control over navigational behaviour. There has been an increase in converting existing educational material into Internet web pages but weaknesses have been identified in current WWW learning systems. There is a lack of conceptual support for learning from hypertext, navigational disorientation and cognitive overload. This implies the need for an established pedagogical approach to developing the web as a teaching and learning medium. Guided Discovery Learning is proposed as an educational pedagogy suitable for supporting WWW learning. The hypothesis is that a guided discovery environment will produce greater gains in learning and satisfaction, than a non-adaptive hypertext environment. A second hypothesis is that combining concept maps with this specific educational paradigm will provide cognitive support. The third hypothesis is that student learning styles will not influence learning outcome or user satisfaction. Thus, providing evidence that the guided discovery learning paradigm can be used for many types of learning styles. This was investigated by the building of a guided discovery system and a framework devised for assessing teaching styles. The system provided varying discovery steps, guided advice, individualistic system instruction and navigational control. An 84 subject experiment compared a Guided discovery condition, a Map-only condition and an Unguided condition. Subjects were subdivided according to learning styles, with measures for learning outcome and user satisfaction. The results indicate that providing guidance will result in a significant increase in level of learning. Guided discovery condition subjects, regardless of learning styles, experienced levels of satisfaction comparable to those in the other conditions. The concept mapping tool did not appear to affect learning outcome or user satisfaction. The conclusion was that using a particular approach to guidance would result in a more supportive environment for learning. This research contributes to the need for a better understanding of the pedagogic design that should be incorporated into WWW learning environments, with a recommendation for a guided discovery approach to alleviate major hypertext and WWW issues for distance learning.

T1  - Cognitive Units, Concept Images, and Cognitive Collages : an Examination of the Processes of Knowledge Construction
AN  - 2833762910
AB  - The fragmentation of strategies that distinguishes the more successful elementary grade students from those least successful has been documented previously. This study investigated whether this phenomenon of divergence and fragmentation of strategies would occur among undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial algebra course. Twenty-six undergraduate students enrolled in a remedial algebra course used a reform curriculum, with the concept of function as an organizing lens and graphing calculators during the 1997 fall semester. These students could be characterized as "victims of the proceptual divide," constrained by inflexible strategies and by prior procedural learning and/or teaching. In addition to investigating whether divergence and fragmentation of strategies would occur among a population assumed to be relatively homogeneous, the other major focus of this study was to investigate whether students who are more successful construct, organize, and restructure knowledge in ways that are qualitatively different from the processes utilized by those who are least successful. It was assumed that, though these cognitive structures are not directly knowable, it would be possible to document the ways in which students construct knowledge and reorganize their existing cognitive structures. Data reported in this study were interpreted within a multi-dimensional framework based on cognitive, sociocultural, and biological theories of conceptual development, using selected insights representative of the overall results of the broad data collection. In an effort to minimize the extent of researcher inferences concerning cognitive processes and to support the validity of the findings, several types of triangulation were used, including data, method, and theoretical triangulation. Profiles of the students characterized as most successful and least successful were developed.Analyses of the triangulated data revealed a divergence in performance and qualitatively different strategies used by students who were most successful compared with students who were least successful. The most successful students demonstrated significant improvement and growth in their ability to think flexibly to interpret ambiguous notation, switch their train of thought from a direct process to the reverse process, and to translate among various representations. They also curtailed their reasoning in a relatively short Period of time. Students who were least successful showed little, if any, improvement during the semester. They demonstrated less flexible strategies, few changes in attitudes, and almost no difference in their choice of tools. Despite many opportunities for additional practice, the least successful were unable to reconstruct previously learned inappropriate schemas. Students' concept maps and schematic diagrams of those maps revealed that most successful students organized the bits and pieces of new knowledge into a basic cognitive structure that remained relatively stable over time. New knowledge was assimilated into or added onto this basic structure, which gradually increased in complexity and richness. Students who are least successful constructed cognitive structures which were subsequently replaced by new, differently organized structures which lacked complexity and essential linkages to other related concepts and procedures. The bits and pieces of knowledge previously assembled were generally discarded and replaced with new bits and pieces in a new, differently organized structure.

T1  - Application of concept maps by middle school science teachers
AN  - 304416801
AB  - The purpose of this study was to ascertain the awareness and utilization of concept mapping as an instructional tool of middle school science teachers and to examine how these middle school science teachers incorporated concept mapping into daily lessons. This study involved two research strategies, survey and interview. The survey involved the voluntary participation of 20 middle school science teachers from the same urban public school district who completed a questionnaire. The questionnaire helped to determine those middle school science teachers who were aware of, and utilized, concept mapping as an instructional tool. Those middle school science teachers who used concept mapping as a teaching strategy were interviewed to ascertain the ways in which they utilized concept mapping as an instructional tool to promote concept learning and achievement. Examples of concept maps teachers used are included.

T1  - Improved memory retention and understanding of ecology concepts through the use of concept mapping in a seventh-grade science classroom
AN  - 304404032
AB  - Concept mapping allows students to organize information in a hierarchical structure. The visual image can be added to or modified as new knowledge or information is added. Concept mapping is an ongoing process in which the structure and key phrases change as the learner obtains more information.    This study involved two seventh-grade science classes. Both classes received ecology instruction but the experimental group also received practice in using concept maps to help visualize and understand key ecological concepts. The control group received no instruction in concept mapping.    A pretest was given at the beginning of the unit. After the two week unit a post test was given and was followed by a delayed post test six weeks later. According to the obtained data, concept mapping did help students in this study remember and assimilate ecology information.

T1  - Constructivism in practice: The case for meaning-making in the virtual world
AN  - 304390885
AB  - This study compares the educational value of constructivist pedagogy as applied through the design, development and experience of 3-D interactive virtual learning environments to a traditional classroom approach and to a no instruction control. The constructivist treatment provided students with access to their choice of source content, 3-D modeling tools and instruction in virtual world development to assist in developing visual, auditory and interactive signs and symbols in the virtual environment. Traditional instruction included a biology textbook, worksheets and teacher-led discussions. Subjects were 117 7th and 8th grade students in a constructivist classroom studying wetland ecology. Students were separated into four groups each of which were responsible for designing and building a virtual learning environment. Content acquisition and meaning-making were measured by a multiple choice, quantitative pre- and post-test, concept map pre- and post-tests, interviews and a survey. Results indicate significant improvement between both quantitative F(1, 79) = 97.58, $p<.001$ and concept map F(1, 63) = 71.75, ($p<.001)$ pre- and post-test measures. However, treatment analysis yielded no significant difference between the Constructivist and Traditional treatments, a significant pre-post treatment interaction between Constructivist and the No Instruction control F(1, 23) = 18.25, ($p<.001$), and no significant difference between the Traditional and No Instruction approach. Interview data comparing built vs. experienced worlds yielded a significant difference F(1, 65) = 14.68, ($p<.001)$. Subsequent research is presented in an Addendum that indicates that virtual world building is both motivational and educationally efficacious.

T1  - Living with chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis
AN  - 304390107
AB  - Chronic pain is a pervasive problem, the prevalence of which is rising. The characteristics of chronic pain remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of living with chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Twenty participants were recruited from rheumatology clinics, the Arthritis Association, and word of mouth. Using concept mapping, ninety-two statements describing living with chronic pain were grouped into seven themes. The themes were: the impact of pain; doing less because of pain; learning to live with pain; positive ways of coping with pain; negative feelings surrounding pain; family issues related to pain; health care issues related to pain. The greatest agreement among participants was for statements regarding learning to live with pain and positive ways of coping with pain; least agreement occurred with statements regarding negative emotions surrounding pain. Insight gained into the individual's perspective of living with chronic pain provides direction for assessment, treatment, and evaluation of chronic pain.

T1  - Impact of multiple sclerosis on marital life
AN  - 304387769
AB  - In this research the impact of multiple sclerosis (MS) on marital life was explored. In phase one, open-ended interviews were conducted and short questionnaires were mailed to volunteer participants. They were asked to respond to the question, "In what ways has MS impacted on your marital life?" In phase two the statements gathered were sorted into homogeneous groups by 14 psychologists. The sorts were statistically analyzed using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis (concept mapping) in order to identify themes. Analysis of patient data resulted in 11 themes: positive impact on marital life, coping and adaptation, sexual issues, financial issues, role of spirituality, lifestyle changes, negative impact on marital life, insecurity, emotional reaction, and anxieties/fears. Analysis of partner data resulted in 9 themes: lifestyle changes, uncertainty about the future, financial issues, emotional reaction, feeling burdened, sense of losing spouse, stresses, changes in approach to life, and positive impact. In phase three separate incident surveys were developed for MS patients and partners to determine the applicability/significance of the items. This data provided a broad, multidimensional perspective on the impact of MS on marital life. Frequency data were calculated for all demographic variables and each of the 97 patient survey items and the 98 partner survey items. T-tests were calculated to determine if items were differentially endorsed based on demographics. There was a great variation in the endorsement rates of the individual items highlighting the uniquely individual and complex nature of the impact of MS on marital life. Cluster #2 (Coping and Adaptation) from the patient concept map had the largest number of patient-endorsed statements perceived to be applicable to them. Cluster #9 (Positive Impact) had the largest number of statements that were perceived by partners to be applicable to them.

T1  - Research Experiences in Teacher Preparation: Effectiveness of the Green Bank preservice teacher enhancement program
AN  - 304379182
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of the preservice teacher component of the Research Experiences in Teacher Preparation (RETP) project aimed at enhancing teacher perceptions of the nature of science, science research, and science teaching. Data was collected for three preservice teacher groups during the three phases of the program: (I) a one week institute held at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory in Green Bank, West Virginia where teachers performed astronomy research using a 40 foot diameter radio telescope; (II) a secondary science methods course; and (III) student teaching placements. Four Likert-type instruments were developed and administered pre and post-institute to assess changes in perceptions of science, attitudes toward research, concerns about implementing research in the classroom, and evaluation of the institute. Instruments were re-administered following the methods course and student teaching. Observations of classroom students conducting research were completed for seven preservice teacher participants in their student teaching placements.    Analysis, using t-tests, showed a significant increase in preservice teachers perceptions of their ability to do research. Preservice teachers were not concerned about implementing research in their placements. No significant change was measured in their understanding of the nature of science and science teaching. Concept maps demonstrated a significant increase in radio astronomy content knowledge. Participants responded that the value of institute components, quality of the research elements, and preparation for implementing research in the classroom were "good" to "excellent". Following the methods course (Phase II) no significant change in their understanding of the nature of science or concerns about implementing projects in the classroom were measured. Of the 7 preservice teachers who were observed implementing research projects, 5 projects were consistent with the Green Bank model. Student teachers who had initiated research in their classrooms had fewer concerns about doing them than those that had not. No significant change was measured in their perceptions of science and science teaching. The RETP project serves as a viable constructivist model for exposing preservice teachers to science research and transferring that experience to the classroom.

T1  - Student's understanding of chemical equilibrium as revealed by algorithmic and conceptual problems
AN  - 304378300
AB  - This study investigated the conceptual and algorithmic problem-solving understanding of secondary students in chemistry in the context of chemical equilibrium. Previously, Nakhleh and Mitchell (1993) probed the differences in performance between algorithmic and conceptual problem-solving questions among chemistry majors. This study extends that research into the secondary level and to the topic of chemical equilibrium. A teaching intervention was used to study possible changes in the conceptual understanding of chemical equilibrium by Advance Placement (A.P.) Chemistry students in a midwestern high school. Three data sources were used: follow-up posttests, problem-solving interviews, and concept maps. The experimental and control groups demonstrated no significant difference in the initial and final concept maps drawn by the students when evaluated for chemical equilibria concepts. The experimental group does, however, post significantly different scores on the student-drawn concept maps when evaluated for the use of particle terminology. It appears that the teaching experiments may have contributed to an increased understanding of the particle nature of reactants and products involved in chemical equilibria systems. The problem-solving interviews provided an effective analysis of the participants' understanding of chemical equilibria and their conceptual understanding of the topic. While demonstrating that the teaching experiments had little effect on the problem-solving methodologies of the participants in either control or experimental groups, several patterns of problem-solving common to both groups and important to the research base were elicited from the data.

The preservice teachers' conceptions of science and science instruction were compared to their lesson plans to determine if their conceptions of science relate to how they plan for science instruction. Two assertions were made regarding this relationship. The first assertion was that preservice elementary teachers who view scientific knowledge as static will plan science lessons that are fact-based, whereas those who view scientific knowledge as dynamic will plan science lessons that are concept-based. The second assertion was that preservice elementary teachers who view learning as a process of transmission will plan science lessons involving teacher demonstrations and textbook explanations, whereas those who view learning as a process of construction will plan science lessons involving inquiry and discovery activities.    Findings indicate that the learning cycle influenced preservice elementary teachers' conceptions of the nature of science and science instruction. At the beginning of the term, students viewed science primarily as a static body of knowledge. By the end of the term, students had more complete understandings of the dynamic nature of science and of the processes used to generate scientific knowledge. Regarding science instruction, students' conceptions evolved from traditional approaches to constructivist approaches using discovery and inquiry explorations. Findings also indicate that preservice elementary teachers' conceptions of science and science instruction do relate to how they plan for science instruction. However, the ability to apply their newly learned instructional strategies was influenced by subject matter knowledge.    During mid-term interviews, the students cited the following factors as producing change in their beliefs of science and science instruction: (a) thinking about science concepts while participating in classroom activities that modeled elementary science lessons using the learning cycle; (b) planning elementary science lessons using the learning cycle; (c) concept mapping; and (d) the perspectives gained from readings in Benchmarks for Science Literacy (AAAS, 1993).

T1  - Using concept maps for assessing adult learners in training situations
AN  - 304371463
AB  - The use of predrawn fill-in concept maps for assessing adult learning in training situations was investigated. A 40-hour training course called Hazardous Waste Operations and Emergency Response (HAZWOPER) was taught to personnel working with hazardous waste and offered in various sites across the U.S. Two types of testing were used, a multiple-choice format and three predrawn fill-in concept maps. To identify differences among trainees that might affect concept map scores, the relationship of ethnicity, administration order of the posttests, a repeated measure of time, and their interactions with concept map test scores were investigated.    For traditional testing, a 23-question multiple-choice format was used. For the alternative measure, three predrawn concept maps required trainees to fill in 30 map nodes. These maps were developed using a unique, rigorous, and systematic procedural framework. The multiple-choice test was used by the instructors offering the training. Reliability for the multiple-choice test was moderate; reliability for the concept map measure was high. There was a positive, moderate correlation between concept map posttest scores and multiple-choice posttest scores.    Ethnic groups included Black, Hispanic, and White/Caucasian. Ethnicity was related to concept map scores, but its effect was mediated by administration order and by time. When the concept map posttest was given first, White/Caucasians obtained a higher concept map mean score than did Hispanics. Administration order had an effect on concept map scores, but was mediated by ethnicity. White/Caucasians scored higher on the concept map measure when given the concept map posttest first. Time was related to concept map scores, but it too was mediated by ethnicity. For time, posttest means were higher than pretest means for all three ethnic groups, with Blacks showing the greatest gain.    This study shows that predrawn fill-in concept maps can be used as an alternative method for quantitatively assessing adult learning in training situations. Three conclusions emerged from this study. (1) The procedure used to develop the concept map measure can be generalized to other assessment settings. (2) The concept map measure assessed some of the same kinds of knowledge assessed by the traditional test. (3) The concept map measure showed the expected mean gain due to the instructional intervention.

T1  - Decision-making in emergency civil commitment
AN  - 304364607
AB  - The public policy domain of decision-making patterns in the emergency civil commitment process is the focus of this study. This research will explore what variables affect the pre-screeners' decision-making process, if some variables or sets of variables are more important than others, and can a dominant decision-making model be identified?    Eleven rural counties in central and southern Illinois were selected through a stratified sample using poverty, rurality and population. Through this process eleven counties, served by eleven separate mental health centers was selected. From the mental health centers the two respondent groups were identified, Executive Directors and pre-screeners.    Twenty-five variables were identified by the researcher as factors or influences in the pre-screening process. Four decision-making models were also identified. Qualitative and quantitative means of inquiry were used to test the importance and influence of these variables, and determine if one of the four decision-making models proved to be the dominant one used in pre-screening.    Pre-screeners were interviewed and participated in three exercises. The first was to describe, using a format prepared by the researcher, four pre-screening situations they had encountered in the past year. Second, to take the 25 variables, sort them according to their similarities and rank them in their importance. Third to complete a closed-ended questionnaire. The Executive Directors completed only a questionnaire.    Utilizing three quantitative statistical tests: concept mapping, t-test, and chi-square; and one qualitative approach: content analysis, the three research questions were answered. The results showed some of the 25 variables were more important than others, there was a set of variables which ranked as the highest in importance, and a dominant decision-making model was identified. In addition to this, it was learned pre-screeners follow a three-step decision-making process when applying the civil commitment criterion established in the Illinois Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code.

T1  - Integrating concept mapping and metacognitive methods in a hypermedia environment for learning science
AN  - 304360300
AB  - Concept maps have been used widely in science education; however, few reports have examined the effectiveness of using concept maps in a hypermedia-based science learning environment. Metacognitive cues have been reported as a useful means to help learners monitor and internalize learning in a hypermedia-based environment; yet, research indicates that more research in this area is needed.    This study used a 2 x 2 factorial design to probe the effects of using concept maps and metacognitive cues in a hypermedia-based genetics program. Based on constructivist perspective, four versions of hypermedia-based genetics tutorial and problem solving program were developed which featured: (1) using a text index or concept map as submenu, (2) embedding activities to promote active learning, (3) prompting to promote students' metacognitive functioning, (4) illustrating with meaningful diagrams and animation-like picture sequences to enhance learning, (5) providing realistic examples and practice to reinforce and promote meaningful learning.    Two-way analysis indicated that the main effects of concept maps and metacognitive cues treatments were not significant, yet the interaction effect of the treatments was significant at p $<$.05 level. One-way analyses of the posttest scores were administered to further examine both concept maps and metacognitive cues treatments individually. These results indicated that both concept maps and metacognitive cues main effects were significant at p $<$.05 level when the treatment groups were compared with the control group.    Qualitative data revealed that students favored having concept maps embedded in the program, but were split on metacognitive cues. The results of this study indicated that: (1) both concept maps and metacognitive cues can enhance learners' learning, (2) concept maps and metacognitive cues interacted with each other and their combination was not superior to each treatment alone, (3) students liked learning in a hypermedia-based environment and they recommended having similar programs to use as supplementary learning material.

T1  - Vascular plants: A middle school life science unit based on the state science objectives
AN  - 304359037
AB  - This seventh grade vascular plants unit is aligned with the State of Michigan's science standards. The focus of the unit is to use the state guidelines, constructivist teaching techniques, concept mapping, and hands-on lab activities to assist students in developing a working knowledge of the structure and function of vascular plants. An additional focus of the unit is to have students become proficient in the use of the lab form for the Michigan Educational Assessment Program (MEAP) test, which is a test of student acquisition of the state science standards. The MEAP lab sheet was used during the unit for most of the labs, demonstrations, and other hands-on activities. The unit culminated with the students using the MEAP sheet to create their own lab protocol.

T1  - Adopting probability curricula: The content and pedagogical content knowledge of middle grades teachers
AN  - 304357494
AB  - This study had two purposes. The first was to describe middle grades teachers' growth in probability knowledge as they participated in the Rational Number Project Middle Grades Teacher Enhancement summer institute. The second was to document the impact of teachers' probability knowledge and teaching experience on probability instruction as they implemented new National Science Foundation-sponsored probability curricula.    Purposive sampling techniques were used throughout this study. Subjects were middle grades teachers having an interest in increasing their pedagogical, psychological, and mathematical content knowledge in order to enable them to effectively implement new curricula. This study took place during the 1996 RNP summer institute and the 1996-1997 academic year, when selected teachers were implementing new curricula in their classrooms.    During the first phase of the study, the probability knowledge of thirty-five middle grades teachers was assessed via pre- and post-instructional written tests, concept maps, and self-ratings. Considering these assessments, four teachers were selected for a multi-case study. Each was interviewed and observed teaching five probability lessons. The lessons and interviews were transcribed verbatim and analyzed for themes and patterns.    Assessment results indicated that most teachers did not possess probability knowledge required to answer questions they would encounter in the NSF-sponsored curricula. Post-instructional assessment results indicated probability knowledge growth as well as increased confidence in their knowledge.    Participants in the case study were selected to permit comparisons on the bases of teachers' probability knowledge and teaching experience. Knowledge of probability had an impact on whether teachers had errors or misconceptions in their lessons and affected teachers' ability to capitalize on student questions and responses. Teaching experience seemed to have less impact on instruction.    In light of this study, recommendations for mathematics education were presented. Specifically, long-term staff development is recommended to facilitate success of curricular reform. This staff development should include, (1) mathematics teaching which models effective pedagogy, (2) review of curricular material, with respect to content knowledge and adaptations required to effectively implement the curricula, and (3) a focus on deeper understandings of key mathematics concepts as well as connections between and within mathematics topics.

T1  - Students' concept patterns revealed by computer analysis of language-constrained science concept maps
AN  - 304356265
AB  - This dissertation consists of four studies that develop a computer-based methodology to construct and evaluate concept maps to explore commonalities in students' representation of ideas in a domain. It also explores whether a progression in learning is evident in concept maps of cross-age students who have experienced a similar curriculum.    The first two studies determine the validity and reliability of the language-constrained concept mapping using The Computer-assisted Concept Mapper as a software analog to traditional concept mapping. Students manipulate teacher-provided concepts and linking phrases; the program encodes each concept map to preserve the relations and equivalent topology. Validity and reliability of this approach is confirmed.    The third study explores the ability of The Concept Map Analyzer hypercard stack to analyze a large number of concept maps and discriminate groups of similar maps. Three hundred seventy-eight sixth, ninth, and twelfth grade students in one school district created concept maps selecting from thirty provided concepts and ten linking phrases related to the water cycle. All pairs of maps are compared for similarities in concepts used and concepts-connected. The algorithm, based on the Pathfinder analysis C-measure, divides the set of common elements by the set of all elements in both concept maps. The similarity ratios which define the congruence between each pair of maps are subjected to cluster analysis to identify groups of similar maps. The number of concepts used and concepts-connected increases from sixth through twelfth grade; however, all three grade levels are represented in each of the seven clusters.    The fourth study explores represented levels of understanding. Software provides a graphic composite of each cluster that shows relations selected by at least the specified percentage of students. The complexity and richness of composite maps generally increases with grade level; however, grade-level composites in this study show only weak differences and progression in understanding for this domain.    This method of analyzing large numbers of concept maps reveals gaps in understanding, alternative relationships, and common beliefs of groups. This information may be useful when designing instruction for conceptual learning, evaluating the effectiveness of a curriculum, or developing a group's shared vision.

T1  - Effects of teacher and student-constructed graphic postorganizers on science achievement for students with learning disabilities
AN  - 304349069
AB  - Science is a neglected area of education, particularly for students with learning disabilities. Because of recent reform efforts in science education, however, researchers, educators, and professionals in the field have proposed scientific literacy for all Americans regardless of grade or ability levels. Consequently, there is currently an increased interest in teaching science to students with learning disabilities.    A major influence in teaching science to students with learning disabilities includes cognitive scientists' recent investigations into how new information is processed and stored in memory. Schema theory and its variant, meaningful reception learning theory, have emerged as possible explanations of how students construct, organize, and retain scientific concepts. Researchers have translated these two theories into practice and have recommended specific techniques to assist students with learning disabilities. In particular, graphic organizers have been investigated to determine if they enhance science learning for students with learning disabilities.    In the present study, an attempt was made to answer the following question: Using traditional instruction with fifth-grade science students who are learning disabled, is there a difference in the mean scores on a science mastery test among (a) students using student-constructed graphic postorganizers, (b) students using teacher-constructed graphic postorganizers, or (c) students receiving traditional instruction only?    An analysis of covariance was used to adjust the science mastery posttest scores of 35 fifth grade science students with learning disabilities from three different schools in a southern suburban school district. The results indicated that there were statistically significant differences between (a) the student-constructed graphic postorganizer group and the teacher-constructed graphic postorganizer group, and (b) the student-constructed graphic postorganizer group and the traditional instruction only group. These results are tenuous, however, because of the moderate to low reliability of the pre- and post-science mastery tests. There was also a limitations due to the significant difference in the demographics of the three groups.    The discussion of these results, however, provide insight into the use of graphic organizers for students with learning disabilities. There is a need to further instigate graphic postorganizers and other techniques that will assist students with learning disabilities in their science learning.

T1  - Programming distributed collaboration interaction through the World Wide Web
AN  - 304342662
AB  - This Thesis presents the implementation of a client/server concept mapping tool as a support for asynchronous workgroup knowledge sharing on the Internet and the World Wide Web. This tool is composed of a server process, named jKSImapper Server, and two client systems: jKSImapper and jKSImapplet, which allow concept mapping elicitation on the Internet and the World Wide Web, respectively. These systems were developed based on the jCMap class library, which is an object-oriented library implemented using the Java programming language. This class library was designed as a framework for the development of systems supporting abstract visual representations while allowing extensibility to support formal knowledge constraints. This Thesis also includes an overview of the issues required for downloadable code; a description of the characteristics of the Java programming language; and the lessons learned when constructing jCMap based on previously existing C++ code.

T1  - Knowing and teaching geography: A qualitative study of pedagogical content knowledge and schemata in expert and novice teachers
AN  - 304338636
AB  - Purpose. The primary purpose of this study was to provide an in-depth description of the geography-related schemata of novice and expert teachers and to explore the nature and extent of content knowledge and pedagogical strategies held by novice and expert educators.    Methods. A qualitative design was utilized in the case studies of three expert and three novice teachers of geography and two professional geographers. The study employed the qualitative techniques of formal and informal interviews, observations, concept mapping, card sorting, responses to instructional material and other prompts, and stimulated recall. Analyses of the data incorporated primarily the strategies of analytic induction and constant comparison, with some enumeration.    Results. Through qualitative analyses of data, five major patterns emerged: (a) in general, teacher participants demonstrated incomplete, fragmentary geographic knowledge; (b) teacher participants demonstrated an intuitive or learned understanding of generative or inductive learning and teaching strategies, and all emphasized student-centered learning; (c) the teachers' views of geography were different in significant ways from those of the professional geographers; (d) studying geography in a systematic, focused, and conceptual manner appears to be related to the depth of one's conceptual understanding of geography; and (e) in the translation of curriculum into instruction, all respondents diminished the value of the geographic content knowledge.    Conclusions. This study provides potential for the increased understanding of how some expert and novice teachers mentally organize and present geographic information. The study also provides a framework and hypotheses for further research on knowing and teaching geography.

T1  - Effects of worldview congruencies and discrepancies in cross-cultural counseling
AN  - 304329826
AB  - This study tested key aspects of a conceptual framework for understanding how change occurs in cross-cultural counseling. Based on literature from anthropology and counseling, it was hypothesized that: (a) client-counselor congruency in worldview would enhance the therapeutic relationship; and (b) client-counselor discrepancy in problem conceptualization would facilitate client change. In the study, interpersonal orientation was selected as worldview, and relationship problems were selected as the problem domain. The hypotheses were tested using a 2 x 2 factorial design, with interpersonal orientation (congruent, discrepant) and problem conceptualization (congruent, discrepant) as the independent variables. A sample of 48 ethnic minority college students experiencing interpersonal problems received two counseling sessions conducted by one of four Anglo counselors according to the specified treatment conditions. Therapeutic relationship was assessed via the Working Alliance Inventory, Empathy scale of the Relationship Inventory, Counselor Rating Form, and thought listing. Client change was evaluated via an interpretation acceptance measure, thought listing, and concept mapping.    The results of quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that client-counselor discrepancy in problem conceptualization enhanced the therapeutic relationship and client-counselor congruency in interpersonal orientation facilitated change. Thus, within the context of cross-cultural counseling devised for the study, the hypothesized independent variables affected the counseling process and outcome, but not in the manner expected. The findings were consistent with those of some previous studies, which found that clients receiving discrepant interpretations viewed their counselors more favorably than clients receiving restatements and that clients receiving interpretations compatible with their broader frame of reference evidenced more positive counseling outcomes than clients receiving incompatible interpretations. The results were also consistent with counseling metatheories that isolate mechanisms of change across diverse therapeutic approaches.

T1  - An investigation of the results of a change in calculus instruction at the University of Arizona
AN  - 304329202
AB  - The results of the change in Calculus instruction at the University of Arizona in 1991, 1992, and 1993 were examined using three complementary methods.
A survey of students (45) who took calculus during this period was administered, and analyzed for attitudinal differences between those who took traditional and those who took reform calculus. There were no statistically significant differences in reported attitude.
Volunteers (14) were solicited from those who had been freshmen during the change to participate in interviews. These interviews included students taught by each method, and were analyzed by using concept maps to determine if there is a difference in retained knowledge. Although consortium (reform) students showed slightly improved retention, the differences were not statistically significant.
University computerized grade records were used to determine if there was a difference between students who took consortium calculus and those who took the traditional course. Both retention and grades in subsequent calculus-dependent mathematics, science, and engineering courses were examined. A pattern of comparisons emerged which showed that consortium students somewhat outperformed traditional students. The patterns were indicative of better teaching and cannot be directly attributed to the materials. There is good evidence that the consortium students were not at a disadvantage in subsequent course work.
This research should be of interest to teachers of calculus, and those involved in calculus reform. The techniques and computer programs for analysis of large data sets for performance differences in subsequent (dependent) course work can be useful for comparing different instructors, procedures, or materials in large institutions.

T1  - Computer-based support for the development of schematic knowledge of mechanics
AN  - 301529313
AB  - Computer-based tools can facilitate the acquisition of correct schemata in learning the concepts of Mechanics.  The thesis argues that a suite of tools is necessary to overcome common difficulties.  The tools are aimed at the acquisition of schemata needed for the theoretical knowledge in the topic, which in turn prepares students for the task of problem solving.We study students' difficulties in learning about Simple Motion, the topic domain chosen for the thesis, though the theory is applicable generally.  We argue that most of the difficulties originate from problems in the learning of schematic knowledge.  This knowledge needs to be accurate before the theory about the domain can be developed.  However, students find it difficult to develop a sufficiently accurate and rich network of schemata to enable them to proceed with learning the theory.  We propose a comprehensive set of principles, derived from cognitive theories of learning, to facilitate the development of the schematic knowledge.  These principles are transformed into a three level framework for instruction: perception, preception, and problem solving.We have built an integrated suite of tools providing a learning environment, based on the set of cognition principles.  The suite of tools comprises simulation, microworld, and concept maps.  Each tool deals with different aspects of conceptual development for the construction of schemata at the first two levels of the framework.  At the first level, perception, they include: concept identification and classification; building links between concepts through proposition; remedying ingrained misconceptions; and use of proper representation.  At the second level, preception, the tools provide students with a simple means to describe different problem situations, to test their schemata against reality, thus inducing meaningful learning.

AB  - All natural hinguage processing systems (such as parsers, generators, taggers) need to have access to a lexicon about the words in the language. This thesis presents a lexicon architecture for natural language processing in Turkish. Given a query form consisting of a surface form and other features acting as restrictions, the lexicon produces feature structures containing morphosyntactic, syntactic, and semantic information for all possible interpretations of the surface form Scitisfying those restrictions. The lexicon is based on contemporary cipproaches like feature-based representation, inheritance, and unification. It makes use of two information sources: a morphological processor and a lexical database contciining all the open and closed-class words of Turkish. The system has been implemented in SICStus Prolog as a standalone module for use in natural language processing applications.Alternate abstract:Bütün doğal dil işleme sistemleri (örneğin çözümleyiciler, üreticiler, metin işciretleyiciler) dildeki kelimeler hakkında, bir sözlüğe erişmeye ihtiyaç duycirlar. Bu tezde, Türkçe’de doğal dil işleme için bir sözlük mimarisi sunulmuştur. Bir kelimenin yüzeysel hali ve kısıtlayıcı diğer özellikler içeren sorguya karşılık, sözlük, verilen kelimenin yüzeysel halinin, bu kısıtlayıcı özellikleri sağlayan her çözümü için biçirnbirimsel/sözdizinsel, şekilsel ve anlamsal özellikler içeren bir özellik yapısı üretir. Sözlük, özellik temelli temsil, kcihtım ve birleştirme gibi çağdaş ycdilaşırnlara dayanır. İki bilgi kaynağı kullanır: bir sözcükyapısal işleyici ve Türkçe’nin bütün açık ve kapalı kelime gruplarını içeren bir kelime veritcd^am. Sistem, SICStus Prolog’d'â kendi başına çalışabilecek ve doğal dil işleme uygulamalarında kullanılabilecek şekilde gerçekleştirilmiştir.

T1  - Aspects of conceptual change of 10-11 year-old children in England and in Greece: The concept of frictional force
AN  - 1838312154
AB  - This is an inquiry carried out in two educational settings, one in England and one in Greece, with 10-11 year-old children and it is guided by a constructivist view of teaching and learning. In both studies, children's conceptions on frictional phenomena and frictional force have been elicited before and after a teaching intervention and they have been compared in order to highlight some aspects of conceptual change. During the teaching interventions the children investigated friction with blocks of wood which were slid on various surfaces of tabletops (sandpaper or plastic laminate) and they discussed their conceptions of friction in everyday life situations with their classmates and the teacher. A modification of the Interview-About-Instances technique has been used to elicit children's conceptions before and after the teaching interventions in both studies. Some additional assessment techniques, like concept maps and children's drawings and writing, have also been used after the teaching interventions in order to obtain information on children's conceptions. This was done to cross-examine inferences drawn from the analyses of the interview data. The Pre-Intervention interview analysis focused on the elicitation of groupings of conceptions and alternative conceptions about frictional phenomena within a context of conceptions of "force". The Post-Intervention interview analysis focused on the elicitation of groupings of conceptions and alternative conceptions about friction and frictional phenomena within the context of the depicted instances of the interview cards. A comparison of the conceptions elicited in the pre-intervention interviews with those of the post-intervention interviews has revealed some aspects of conceptual change which are illustrated with the analysis of two cases of children in each study. This inquiry has found that children can develop conceptions of friction within its "surface roughness" approximation. The interlocking of the roughness of surfaces appears for them to be a plausible and fruitful explanatory framework to describe and interpret friction and frictional phenomena. Some of children's preconceptions about "grip", the role of the nature of surfaces in contact and the role of gravity, or the force of weight influencing frictional phenomena, appear to be retained and enhanced throughout the teaching interventions by adding new characteristics or properties or by extending their frames of reference for different contexts. In both studies, there appear to be similarities in the conceptions elicited about frictional phenomena and the way conceptual change occurs, despite some language differences, which appear to be reflected on the construction of children's propositional statements.

T1  - Collaborative concept mapping and children's learning in primary science
AN  - 898766498
AB  - The problem addressed here is that of children's difficulty in learning meaningfully the language of science.  Meanings arise in successful acts of communication between individuals, in the context of specific types of activities.  Hence communication between pupils using scientific ideas is hypothesized as a worthwhile, effective learning approach.Concept mapping is suggested as a means of structuring discussion about scientific meanings, and thereby is supporting learning.  Although previous research has indicated that concept mapping has a positive effect on pupils' learning, little is known of how this effect is produced or of the contribution made by collaborative group discussion.This research used qualitative and quantitative approaches to investigate the potential for concept mapping to improve 9- to 11-year-old children's learning in science.  It focused on:  developing appropriate ways of introducing children to concept mapping;   comparing the effect on learning outcomes from concept mapping with those from a conventional teaching approach;  comparing the quality of concept maps produced by individuals with those produced by children working collaboratively;   analysing talk in collaborative concept mapping groups from a sociolinguistic perspective, to identify processes at work in the dissertation.The findings extend those of previous research.  They show concept mapping to be beneficial for learning, and to support sustained small-group discussion of scientific ideas.  The resulting discourse structure differed substantially from common patterns of classroom talk, often involving children in collaborative construction of relationships shown in the concept maps.  When this was the case, the relationships were more likely to be scientifically valid than when primarily the contribution of individuals.

T1  - The biology curriculum for senior high schools in Manitoba
AN  - 304330646
AB  - This practicum involved the development of the conceptual framework, curriculum design, introductory material, and field validation curriculum implementation document for the new Biology 30S (grade 11) course in Manitoba. The study examined recent science curriculum reform movements, trends in biology curriculum design, and recent theories of learning as they apply to science education.    The new Biology 30S curriculum was designed to provide teachers with a more comprehensive and usable document for implementation at the classroom level. Learning outcomes are presented in a way that prescribe what the student will know and be that to do as a result of completing a particular learning activity. The suggested instructional strategies allow the student to become actively involved in the learning process through activities such as laboratory investigations, journal writing, concept mapping, cooperative learning, modeling, research, and debates. More emphasis is also placed on the development of science process skills, critical and creative thinking skills, communication skills, and science-technology-society connections.    Development of the curriculum materials occurred in the context of a pre-selected provincial committee consisting of senior biology teachers, university professors, community college biology instructors, and science curriculum consultants. Materials were reviewed and approved by all committee members prior to the release of the field validation version of Biology 30S to pilot schools in the summer of 1995.    Training sessions for pilot teachers occurred during the first semester of the 1995-96 school year. Feedback concerning field testing of the new curriculum was collected from these teachers during this time. Subsequent recommendations for revisions to the curriculum have been made with the intention of implementing these changes prior to phase 2 field validation scheduled for the 1996-97 school year.

T1  - Clinical teaching: The development of expertise
AN  - 304325085
AB  - Clinical teaching suffers from the lack of a coherent theoretical base necessary to inform its practitioners. Research to date focusses primarily on the perceptions of faculty and students with regard to the characteristics of effective clinical teaching. Moreover, the characteristics of effective clinical teaching used in the research are generated from the researchers' assumptions of what constitutes effective clinical teaching. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the thinking of novice and expert clinical teachers in order to understand how clinical teachers conceptualize effective clinical teaching.    The conceptual framework chosen for the study was symbolic interactionism. The advantage of symbolic interactionism was that it provided a means of how understanding of effective clinical teaching was developed through interactions with others and with the self through reflection. Furthermore, it acknowledged the importance of cognitive activity and enabled the researcher to probe the thoughts of clinical teachers in order to understand the meaning of effective clinical teaching and how it was developed in the thinking of the study participants.    Five novice and five expert clinical teachers were interviewed three times by the researcher. In addition each of the participants recorded their thinking about effective clinical teaching in journals. Concept maps were developed for each of the participants delineating their thinking about effective clinical teaching and how that thinking had developed through their experiences.    Three themes emerged from the findings: (i) Learning Clinical Teaching, (ii) Practices of Clinical Teaching, and (iii) Knowing Students. The study uncovered similarities and differences in the conceptualization of effective clinical teaching by novice and expert clinical teachers. The centrality of the role of experience in the development of expertise in effective clinical teaching was revealed. Clinical teaching was perceived as a complex process, not well understood by novice clinical teachers. Novices were uncertain about their clinical teaching practices and described the overwhelming responsibility they felt for students and patients. The rich descriptions of expert clinical teachers of clinical teaching reflected their broad experiential base.    The findings of this study provide a beginning understanding of how novice and expert clinical teachers think about effective clinical teaching. Through the voices of the participants, a description of clinical teaching emerged. While the findings support what is known in the literature about effective clinical teaching, they conceptually link the characteristics of effective clinical teaching in a different configuration. Attributes of clinical teaching expertise add clarity to the existing literature. Furthermore, the study reveals other aspects of effective clinical teaching heretofore not identified.

T1  - Indiana high school biology teachers and evolutionary theory: Acceptance and understanding
AN  - 304320583
AB  - The purpose of this dissertation was to explore the status of and relationships among the variables of teacher acceptance of evolutionary theory, teacher understanding of evolutionary theory, and teacher understanding of the nature of science among Indiana public high school biology teachers. The relationships between these variables and the emphasis evolution receives in the classroom and teacher academic variables were investigated. Teacher knowledge structure of the concept of evolution was also explored.    To answer the questions and hypotheses delineated in the study, a 68-item questionnaire and concept mapping activity was administered to the population of 989 teachers. The response rate was 53%.    The teachers exhibited only a moderate level of acceptance and a marginal level of understanding of evolutionary theory. Teacher understanding of the nature of science was moderately high. Evolution played only a minor role in the curriculum. While the teachers had completed considerable course work in biology, the vast majority lacked specific course work in evolution and the nature of science.    The data revealed a significant relationship between teacher acceptance and teacher understanding of evolutionary theory and between teacher acceptance of evolutionary theory and teacher understanding of the nature of science. The data also revealed significant associations between teacher allocation of instructional time to evolution and teacher level of acceptance of evolutionary theory, teacher level of understanding of evolutionary theory, teacher level of understanding of the nature of science, and teacher completion of a course in evolution. Additionally, the data revealed significant associations between teacher level of understanding of evolutionary theory and teacher completion of a course in evolution and teacher academic background in biology. Significant associations were revealed between teacher level of acceptance of evolutionary theory and both teacher completion of a course in evolution and teacher completion of a course in the nature of science.    A significant amount of the variance in teacher acceptance of evolutionary theory was explained by the other variables delineated. The concept mapping activity revealed that teacher acceptance and understanding of evolutionary theory was reflected in teacher knowledge structure of evolution and that teachers' knowledge structures were characterized by an unsophisticated organizational framework.

T1  - A criticalist exploration of the Tamilian female perspective on female literacy and literacy education in Tamil Nadu, India
AN  - 304315551
AB  - This criticalist inquiry investigated non-Western female perspectives relating to literacy and literacy education in Tamil Nadu, India. This "study at the intersections" constituted an effort at constructing a modern Tamilian frame of reference based upon the inquirer's varied cultural orientations, her perspectives on Tamilian female issues, and her examination of semi-structured interviews conducted with twenty literate Tamilian females from a few Tamilian cities in south India. After analysis of the transcriptions, each interview was concept-mapped together with a final consensus to visually lay out problems and concerns in female literacy education. The findings revealed a complex blend of historical, sociocultural, religious, economic, and political tensions all interweaving in subtle ways. In addition to examining her own cultural orientations, the inquirer discussed the real life concerns of the Tamilian participants and presented nuances in the portraiture so as to encourage exchanges of cognitive maps among different cultures.

T1  - A comparative study of note-taking, outlining and concept mapping learning strategies on National Taipei Teachers College students' understanding of heat and temperature
AN  - 304305889
AB  - This study was designed to compare the effectiveness of note-taking, outlining, and concept mapping learning strategies on non-science students' understanding of heat and temperature at a teachers college in Taiwan. Six classes of sophomore non-science major students spent two weeks learning about heat and temperature while using the different learning strategies. Students' understanding was measured in terms of performance on a traditional multiple-choice examination, a constructed-response (essay) examination and an interview (oral) examination.    The results of the analyses permit the following statements: in terms of the overall students' performance as measured by the total examination scores (multiple-choice score + essay score), students who used either an outlining or concept mapping learning strategy scored significantly better than students who used only a personalized note-taking strategy. These differences are almost totally attributed to the differences in the essay portion of the written examinations. Students were able to achieve almost equal scores on the multiple-choice tests but when pressed for explanations on the constructed response, essay-type examinations, they were unable to provide the in-depth responses necessary to earn high marks. This suggests that students had different levels of understanding depending on which learning strategies they used.    These differences in in-depth understanding among the students using the various learning strategies are further supported by the interview data: (1) Students from the concept mapping learning strategy groups had the best reasoning skills. Most of them answered the interview questions reasonably, and completely. (2) Students from the outlining learning strategy groups usually had developed the relationship between heat and temperature. But they often showed an incomplete understanding of the difference between heat and temperature. (3) Students from the note-taking learning strategy groups, usually constructed fragmentary and contradictory explanations from their intuitive conceptions which were different from the scientific explanations.

T1  - Concept mapping: An effective instructional strategy in science with kindergarten students
AN  - 304302767
AB  - This study investigated the claim made by kindergarten teachers that concept mapping, as described in the Developmental Approaches in Science, Health, and Technology (DASH) Program, is an effective instructional strategy to use with their students. Classroom evidence was sought to verify this claim.    A questionnaire designed to determine the reasons for this claim was sent to all DASH trained kindergarten teachers. The most common reasons and ideas among the 160 teachers who responded were identified. A list of research areas on the effectiveness of concept mapping and potential evidence for each was compiled from the responses.    A review of the literature supported many of the reasons suggested by the teachers. Six case studies were conducted at three geographically diverse locations. The video tapes, field notes, photographs, and interviews from the case studies were then analyzed for supporting evidence of the teachers' reasons for the effectiveness of this strategy.    All the most often mentioned reasons identified from the questionnaire were validated in the case study data. This study found that kindergarten students did organize information and make connections between ideas on concept maps. Both class concept maps and individual student interviews, exhibited several levels of categorization and showed connections between ideas. Kindergarten students did supply the teacher with information about their prior knowledge and their on-going learning on concept maps. Video tapes, field notes, and class concept maps provided evidence of students sharing their prior knowledge and experiences and teachers recording them. Concept mapping did support multiple modes of learning and had a high rate of student participation. Concept mapping can give teachers a context to build students' self esteem and cooperative learning skills. Video tapes, field notes, photographs, and student interviews provided evidence for these claims. Data concerning knowledge acquisition were inconclusive.    This study presents strong evidence for the effectiveness of using concept mapping as a teaching strategy with young children. This finding leads to implications for pre-service training, professional staff development, assessment, and curriculum development.

T1  - Evaluating behavioral and cognitive task analysis methods for the design of training for technical troubleshooters
AN  - 304296473
AB  - Task analysis delineates how experts use learned skills to perform complex work. Task analysis specifies the knowledge which skilled performers have encoded into schema and mental models, as well as how they operationalize this knowledge. Task analysis, therefore, is a key component of instructional design, as well as of related areas such as systems analysis and design; knowledge engineering, elicitation, acquisition, and representation; psychological or mental testing; performance analysis; job analysis; business process engineering; and performance technology.    Ironically, task analysis methods have not received enough systematic examination. There are well over a hundred task analysis methods and variations, most inadequately specified and validated, and no generally accepted taxonomies to classify either tasks and task analysis methods. Thus, task analysis method selection is now more art than science.    This study develops a framework adapted from psychological testing for the comparative analysis of task analysis methods and evaluates several methods: the PAQ, task description, PARI, GOMS, think-aloud protocol analysis, and concept mapping. Training for technical troubleshooting is the focus of this evaluation, but the framework generalizes to other uses of task analysis and other domains of knowledge. Anderson's theory of cognition and knowledge types is advanced as a basis for further work on taxonomies for tasks and task analysis methods, as well as a system for matching task and appropriate analytical methods.

The pharmacist is now involved in direct patient care and must be cognizant of the social, economic, political, and religious implications of medicine that daily affect their patients' lives. The principal objective of this study is to identify and analyze common and unique understandings of experienced and novice pharmacists as they relate to social responsibility and the pharmacist's role.    Research questions. (1) How aware are pharmacists of the ethical dilemmas of their practice? (2) What is the concept pharmacists have of social responsibility issues and the role of pharmacists? (3) What is the responsibility pharmacists feel toward their patients or society? (4) How did pharmacists construct their conception of social responsibility?    Research paradigm and methods. An experienced/novice dichotomy was selected for this study in order to examine the beliefs and conceptions of individuals who are expected to exhibit substantial differences in knowledge, curricular exposure, and perspectives toward social responsibility. The process of analyzing pharmacists' conceptions of their social responsibility incorporated three sequential qualitative tasks in which pharmacists wrote an essay on an ethical situation in medicine, constructed a concept map, and responded to a semistructured interview.    Conclusions. All pharmacists exhibited a concern for the appropriate use of medicinals in society and an understanding that their profession was an ethical enterprise. Experienced pharmacists (practicing more than 10 years) believed the authority in healthcare was the physician, therefore envisioning their role as a help-mate that is bound by legal constraints. Novices had a more personal conviction since they viewed themselves as an active member of a participatory team of healthcare professionals. Novices lacked a vision of the larger concepts of social responsibility while experienced pharmacists recognized the diversity of the patients they serve and the financial and political pressures on healthcare. In order to survive impending dynamic changes, pharmacists must reevaluate their definition of social responsibility and must not be limited by risk aversion, an expert's dominance, or the desire to be an inconspicuous assistant.

T1  - A qualitative analysis of gender differences in the experience of depressive symptoms
AN  - 304288760
AB  - It is well established that women as opposed to men are more frequently identified as exhibiting depressive symptoms and are diagnosed as experiencing unipolar depression. Despite variations in research methodology or diagnostic criteria, women as opposed to men predominate in treated and untreated cases of depression by a ratio of approximately 2 to 1. Significantly higher rates of unipolar depression have been found among Caucasian, African American, and Hispanic women as opposed to men in these ethnic groups. These phenomenon appear to hold true even after factors such as levels of income, occupation, and education are controlled. This trend is evidenced for women in the United States as well as for women in western European countries. Various theories have been proposed to explain these phenomena. These theories represent a broad range of perspectives including learned helplessness theory, coping theory, gender role theory, and biological or hormonal factors unique to women. However, no research based on these theoretical explanations has yet completely accounted for the predominance of women regarding depression and depressive symptoms. This investigation is phenomenologically focused, aimed at the identification and exploration of latent constructs salient to women's and men's experience of depressive symptoms. This investigation employs a two-study research design that blends qualitative and quantitative research strategies. In Study 1 an alternative research methodology, concept mapping, was used to elicit and graphically represent participants' perceptions of depressive experience. Participants in Study 1 were community college students (n = 59). Qualitative data reduction was also employed to derive a depressive symptom inventory based on these perceptions. In Study 2 this questionnaire was administered to a larger sample (n = 393) of community college students. Stepwise discriminate function and regression analysis were employed to determine the variation of participant responses regarding gender, level of depressive symptoms, and gender role identification. Results of the two studies suggest that women's depressive symptoms were related to potential relations between such variables as experiences of despair, emotional expression, and interpersonal difficulties. Men's depressive symptoms were potentially related to important anger and interpersonal conflicts. Results showed little support for the influence of gender role identification on depressive symptom expression.

T1  - The effect of constructivist hypermedia in bringing about conceptual change in preservice elementary teachers' science frameworks
AN  - 304282263
AB  - The alternative framework that students bring to the science classroom often have considerable effect on the ideas and concepts held by students as they leave that classroom. Addressing these alternative frameworks has been an area of great interest in science education.    This study examined the effect of a computer-based hypermedia program, developed to incorporate constructivist philosophy, in bringing about conceptual change in pre-service elementary teachers' alternative frameworks in regard to global warming.    The alternative frameworks of students (n = 33) enrolled in an elementary-level science methods course were examined through the use of concept maps, Pathfinder networks, and semi-structured interviews. One group of students then made use of a constructivist hypermedia software global warming program while the second group used a hypermedia program on global warming that was judged to be non-constructivist. Post-treatment involved a second round of construction of concept maps, building of Pathfinder networks, and semi-structured interviews.    Information from this study suggests that students who used the constructivist hypermedia did gain a more sophisticated understanding of the phenomena of global warming and their views became more similar to the current scientific understanding of this topic. However, even though these students did show evidence of more sophisticated and scientifically valid frameworks, they did not abandon initial alternative frameworks.    These results suggest the value of hypermedia developed with constructivist philosophy in mind. This software can help learners develop more complex knowledge structures in areas of science subject to the development of alternative frameworks. The data also suggest that, while more complex knowledge may be gained in regard to a certain topic, concentrated effort must be devoted to addressing and mitigating alternative frameworks associated with that topic.

T1  - Personal power, authority, and influence: Cultural foundations for leadership and leadership formation in northeast Thailand and implications for adult leadership training
AN  - 304274673
AB  - This study explores indigenous concepts of leadership and leadership formation within five specific contexts in Northeast Thailand. It takes an interpretivist approach, employing an ethnographic research strategy. In the process, it seeks to maintain a more balanced and comprehensive approach, and secure a more emic perspective on the study of Thai leadership than that found in the research literature. It also reflects the biography of the researcher as leader of a non-government organization operating in Northeast Thailand.    A series of in-depth interviews was conducted with leaders from the business, government, military/police, religious, and local community contexts in the Northeastern Thai province of Sisaket in order to answer the question: "What constitutes a 'good leader' in these contexts and how does one go about being and developing such a leader?" These leaders related their stories on how they became leaders, their behavior as leaders, and the values and motivations which underlie their practice as leaders. The findings which emerged from these interviews are documented in both narrative leadership "profiles" and synthetic "concept maps."    Significant among these findings are three distinct cultural foundations for leadership and leadership formation: personal power (baramii), authority (amnaat), and influence (ittiphon). These are summarized in a "Leadership Foundations Continuum" in which the case is made for baramii as the culturally preferred leadership foundation for these specific Northeastern Thai contexts.    Reflected in these foundations are four contrasting pairs of leadership types and styles. The "natural" and "moral" types, and the "democratic" and "family" styles, are then presented as those which best operationalize the baramii leadership foundation.    In addition, four separate leadership strategies emerged including involvement in civic work, community development work, and politics, and the maintenance and promotion of morality. These are presented as effective means for developing the baramii leadership foundation.    These findings are then reviewed in light of the relevant literature, underscoring the viability of the baramii leadership foundation as the culturally preferred means for conceptualizing and operationalizing leadership and leadership formation in these five specific contexts in Northeast Thailand. Finally, implications of these findings for adult leadership training are discussed.

T1  - The effects of Gowin's Vee heuristic diagramming and concept mapping on meaningful learning in the radiation science classroom and laboratory
AN  - 304272990
AB  - The effects of Vee heuristic diagraming and concept mapping utilization during classroom and laboratory learning by college level nuclear medicine technology students were investigated in this study. Meaningful learning was evidenced by group performance gains, positive attitudinal preferences, and student misconception identification and remediation.    The effects of the learning intervention on group performance gains were calculated for two groups of 16 students each. The effect size was a moderate to large effect of 0.66. An ANCOVA was conducted for group performances using the student's SAT score as the covariate. The group differences were significant at the 0.05 level. There were no significant differences based on gender.    ANOVA analyses were conducted to test for SAT category efficacy. There were significant differences based on SAT category (p = 0.024), with the groups falling into the low and moderate SAT categories showing the greatest gains in using the learning intervention (effect sizes of 0.81 and 0.77, respectively).    Attitudinal preferences toward Vee diagraming and concept mapping were identified. After 21 weeks of using the learning intervention, 72% of the respondents could agree with, or did not oppose Vee diagraming and concept mapping as a learning modality.    A qualitative analysis of the learning intervention was conducted. The student Vee diagrams and concept maps were successfully utilized as interaction guides in order to identify student misconceptions, and to successfully facilitate remediation in the form of a cognitive congruence between the student and the instructor.    The convergence of the quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated that this learning intervention did encourage meaningful learning, as seen in group performance gains and remediative teacher-student interactions, and as such, confirms the Ausubel-Novak-Gowin theory of meaningful learning.

T1  - Teaching the structure and function of plants to seventh grade students
AN  - 304256747
AB  - The topic of my thesis is using the constructivist approach to teach the structure and function of plants to seventh grade students. I included a combination of various teaching and learning strategies with a focus on "hands-on" activities. Students conducted laboratory investigations that I developed at Michigan State University in 1995. They made concept maps, wrote in journals, and dissected flowers as part of this unit. I used a focus group consisting of 2 higher-level students, 2 middle-level students, and 2 lower-level students for purposes of evaluation. These students all showed significant improvement in their understanding of the structure and function of plants after the teaching of this unit.

T1  - Conceptual change in probability and randomness of high school students using computer simulations
AN  - 304242883
AB  - This study investigated high school students' conceptual change on probability and randomness after the students used computer simulation programs. More specifically the research examined: (1) whether students' knowledge of probability and randomness improved; (2) what students' concepts were changed; (3) why students changed their concepts; (4) how students changed their concepts; and (5) what students thought and experienced about computer simulation programs. Question (1) was a quantitative study. It was investigated through pretest, posttest, and students' concept maps. A statistical analysis--one tailed t-test--was used. Questions (2) to (5) applied qualitative methodologies. They were investigated through multiple data sources such as: students' concept maps, learning logs, students' reasoning in pretest and posttest, fieldnotes, and evaluation on teaching-learning. The study is based on constructivist theory, conceptual change theory, and schema theory.    The computer simulation programs were developed by the Boston University Center for Polymer Studies. These programs were titled: Coin Flipping, 1-D Random Walk, Pascal's Triangle, Many Walkers, Diffusion, Coastline Dimension, and Fractal Dimension.    Thirty six grade-11 mathematics students from a suburban high school were used as the sample. They finished a pretest before the program, did the computer simulation programs, and 40 days after the experience they took a posttest. The students worked during regular classroom time.    The research found that students improved their knowledge of probability and randomness. Students changed some ideas of probability and randomness by changing their concept maps and their reasoning in their posttest. Students developed their ideas by explaining more exactly, explicitly, and clearly using statistical terms. Students liked the computer simulation programs and found that the class was fun and interesting.

T1  - Technology in two middle school classrooms: A case study
AN  - 304242477
AB  - This dissertation reports on an investigation into the role that a particular technology-based material played in a fifth grade and a sixth grade classroom. The Great Ocean Rescue was researched because it was judged to manifest through technology the promising theories and practices of situated learning, cooperative learning, and anchored instruction. The inquiry sought to learn if the material was able to support effective teaching and meaningful learning and to therefore be an example of the productive use of technology in two middle school classrooms.    The investigation was conducted as a qualitative case study. Six areas were initially identified for special focus: the context of each implementation; the degree of curriculum integration of the material; the teachers assessments; student learning outcomes; cooperative learning; and the student-teacher interaction patterns during the use of the material. Findings in all those areas are reported in detail. Student learning outcomes were measured by analyzing student conversations and by scoring student concept maps on the subject of ocean. Both measures indicated that student learning of science concepts and methods occurred as a result of using the material. It was also concluded that the material encouraged a constructivist style of classroom.    The impact of cooperative learning was found to be largely positive with a few exceptions. Cooperative learning and the use of role playing to develop interdependency was found to positively contribute to both cognitive and social progress.    The material was found to be successful at creating a dynamic learning environment in the classroom. The technology-based material played a significant role in presenting information, creating a simulation, and engaging the students in that information. Situated learning was largely successful in helping students to enter into a "community of practice" and created a need for the students to use what they were learning and to talk about what they were learning.    Intellectual arguments relating to the role of computers in society and in the classroom, and aspects of the relationship of technology to democracy were considered on their own merits and in relation to the findings of the case study.

T1  - Concept mapping through logs and metacognitive reflection during third graders' scientific problem-solving
AN  - 304231887
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate third graders' metacognitive and science problem-solving processes for the purpose of formulating an instructional metacognitive model from the data. The researcher analyzed six third-grade students' concept maps and science reflective logs in order to identify the learning processes of children engaged in science problem-solving tasks.    The materials for data collection were composed of the pretest and posttest concept map, think-aloud protocols of problem solving, and reflective logs. The think-aloud protocols measured the metacognitive processes during the problem-solving sessions. The concept maps and reflective logs explicated the metacognitive processes further.    Each participant took part in six problem-solving activities on the topic of electricity. The sessions were videotaped and audiotaped, and analyzed further by the researcher. At the beginning of the unit, a pretest concept map was constructed by each learner, to tap into prior knowledge of the learners. At the end of the unit, a posttest map was constructed by each learner. This posttest was done to evaluate the acquired knowledge and scientific conceptual change of each participant.    Data analysis was descriptive and used a small heterogeneous population. The data analysis took place in two different phases. In Phase 1 of the analysis, the researcher analyzed think-aloud videotape and audiotape sessions of problem-solving tasks. A cognitive- metacognitive framework was used to observe the overt behavior of all six participants. During Phase 2, the investigator focused on case studies of the participants and used a metacognitive science problem-solving instructional model to analyze maps and logs. The model used Vygotsky's theory of everyday concepts and scientific thinking.    The use of the problem-solving sessions was essential to the study because metacognitive behaviors were activated that ordinarily are not present in other classroom activities. All areas of cognitive and metacognitive behaviors were activated. Children explored, monitored their progress, and gave suggestions to others. Learners recorded ideas in logs and on maps, moving from everyday concepts to scientific thinking. Throughout the process, participants self-questioned, self-monitored, and self-reflected.

T1  - The effect of talk and writing, alone and combined, on learning in science: An exploratory study
AN  - 250297596
AB  - The ultimate purpose of the study was to serve as a template for new research. To this end, trends in the data were investigated in order to formulate hypotheses and questions, and to recommend procedures that might be used in a follow-up study. The more immediate or proximate purpose of this exploratory study was to investigate the role of talk and writing, alone and combined, in learning in science. Moreover, gender and ability were considered in the design and analyses in order to identify any possible aptitude-treatment interactions.    The study was conducted in a Franco-Manitoban school, grade seven to twelve, in a major city in the Canadian prairies. Two intact grade eight science classes, both taught by a teacher who volunteered to participate in the study, served as the sample. The 43 students were randomly assigned to three treatment and one control groups, all stratified for gender and ability. All three treatment groups received the same problem tasks, once per school cycle, during the teaching of a science unit on ecology. The control group received simpler descriptive tasks based on similar content. Apart from these sessions, the instruction was identical for all students. The tasks in the problem sessions involved constructing scientific explanations for real-world applications of ecological concepts. The tasks required that students integrate simple knowledge about ecology into more complex and elaborate knowledge.    Students in the talk-only group (T) discussed the problem tasks in small peer groups. Students in the writing-only group (W) individually wrote responses for each of the tasks but without talking to other students. Students in the combined talk and writing group (TW) discussed the problems in small peer groups prior to individually writing a response for each question. The control group (C) completed simple learning tasks based on the same material during the problem sessions.    The independent variables included treatment (T, W, TW & C), gender and ability. Dependent variables included simple, integrated and total knowledge scores based on multiple choice tests, essay questions, concept maps, as well as aggregate measures, at three times during the study (pretest, immediate posttest and delayed posttest). In addition, some of the discussions were videotaped, transcribed and analyzed to determine how student understanding evolved in these peer groups.    Statistical treatment of the data involved a series of analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) using pretest scores as covariates each time. Post hoc analyses using pairwise comparisons and group contrasts were also employed to examine trends in the data. The findings suggest that peer discussion appears to be an important mechanism by which students construct knowledge. Furthermore, peer discussion combined with writing appears to enhance the retention of science learning over time. Moreover, gender and ability may be important mediating variables that determine the effectiveness of talk and writing for enhancing learning. Questions and hypotheses have been formulated for future research using revised instruments and methods with a larger sample size.

T1  - Abused women's experience with the justice system: Concept mapping
AN  - 193484835
AB  - The majority of research on abused women's experiences with the justice system has been conducted by advocates within the system seeking reform. This research typically has included both samples of justice officials as well as abused women. Usually predetermined surveys and interview schedules have been utilized. Research on how abused women cope with these experiences is limited. In this study concept mapping, a method which combines both qualitative and quantitative strategies, was used to identify and categorize the experiences or issues that abused women have had with the justice system and their ways of coping. The study consisted of two phases. In phase one semi-structured interviews, a focus group and a written format were used to gather information from abused women who attend groups for support. Ninety-eight issues and experiences with the justice system, and 59 different ways of coping with these experiences were identified. The data was sorted and named by the abused women. It was then analyzed using multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis to produce two concept maps that resulted in ten and six themes. The themes identified by the women regarding issues and experiences were: minimizing the seriousness of wife assault by courts; the courts encourage continued abuse; problems with lawyers; victims through the legal system; continued financial abuse; lack of support, information and resources; child issues, custody issues and calls for assistance; failure to serve and protect; maintenance enforcement/child support; and effective/ineffective community services. The themes identified by the women regarding coping were: escape/reference to children's coping; seeking protection/effects of stress; struggling to stay sane; helplessness/giving up; coping through other resources and professionals; and seeking information/mending. In phase two, a survey was distributed to agencies and organizations that assist abused women to determine the prevalence and variation of the issues/experiences and coping strategies. The women surveyed experienced similar issues. They indicated they had difficulty coping with the justice system. The results of this research could serve as the basis for developing counselling strategies for abused women to help them cope with their experiences with the justice system.

T1  - The experience of female spouses of chronic low back pain sufferers
AN  - 193484752
AB  - The experience of female spouses of chronic low back pain (CLBP) sufferers was investigated using concept mapping, a blend of qualitative and quantitative methods. In Phase One, 14 spouses contributed 70 statements, which while predominantly negative, included extreme disruption as well as neutral and positive experiences. In Phase Two, 21 female spouses sorted the 70 statements into homogenous groups. The sorted data were analyzed using concept mapping techniques to produce a map that consisted of seven themes: Depression/Isolation, Coping, Severe Couple Disruption, Focus on Pain Sufferer, Countercoping, Pain Focus, and Relationship Disruption. Further interpretation divided these seven clusters into two groups: mediators or consequences of pain. In Phase Three, 71 participants rated the 70 original statements, of which, 24 were determined to be common and/or prominent. Spouses most commonly experienced frustration because they could not do anything about their partner's pain, had a difficulty looking to the future, dealt with situations one day at a time, learned to do things differently and learned patience and compassion for others.

T1  - Tales from the mud: The situated learning experience of television production specialists in distance education
AN  - 304288870
AB  - The purposes of this study were to examine the learning process of television-production specialists in distance education, to identify the skills and knowledge necessary to perform their jobs, and to explore the role that the television-production specialist plays in relation to other identifiable roles, such as instructors and instructional designers. The purposive sample for this study consisted of 12 full-time television-production specialists who were employed for at least one year at four-year American universities to produce live, interactive, video-based educational programs. Prior to employment at their respective universities, these people had no experience or educational background in the field of distance education.    Qualitative methods, including semi-structured interviews, observation, and concept maps, were used to collect data during the study. The analysis gave rise to findings in areas pertaining to situated learning experiences and role development of these participants.    This study found that a "mindset change" occurs in television-production specialists who produce live, interactive, video-based programs when participants alter their criteria for judging the quality of their work. Participants became conscious of this change by examining their previously held assumptions regarding video quality and reflecting on their own behavioral changes.    Television-production specialists' learning was situated socially, through interaction with colleagues, and experientially, where participants learned by "just doing it." Much of the actual learning that took place was of an informal nature.    The study also found that television-production specialists play many roles in a live, interactive, video-based program. Their responsibilities stretched far beyond their previous experience and training to fill these varied roles, including instructional designer.

T1  - An empirical study on the knowledge acquisition process for expert systems
AN  - 304253365
AB  - Expert systems, a form of artificial intelligence, are computer programs that enhance the problem-solving and decision-making performances of users. The power of these systems is mostly dependent on the knowledge that is extracted from the experts. This process of extracting expertise is called knowledge acquisition.    The objective of the research was to determine how the knowledge source (domain expert), task features (domain), knowledge engineer (expert system developer) and knowledge acquisition technique affect the effort needed to develop a knowledge base, the time spent to develop a knowledge base and the quality of the elicited knowledge base. Nine librarians, six pilots (experts) and nine graduate university students (knowledge engineers) served as subjects in this study. Two types of domains were investigated: (1) an aircraft flight maneuver task and (2) a librarian material selection task. In the experiment, each person serving as an expert participated in the study using all three techniques: (1) interview, (2) verbal protocol and (3) concept mapping with three different knowledge engineers. Results of ANOVAs showed a significant effect of task type only for the completeness measurement and not for all other measurements. In addition, results of ANOVAs showed that the quality of the knowledge base was more dependent on the knowledge engineer's personal characteristics and performance than a selected knowledge acquisition technique. However, the time spent on both knowledge elicitation and knowledge analysis is dependent on the knowledge acquisition technique. The verbal protocol technique shortened the time spent on knowledge elicitation, whereas the concept mapping technique shortened the time spent on analysis. From the point of a knowledge engineer, it could be concluded that the concept mapping technique is the most efficient and requires the least effort spent. On the other hand, domain experts were split, with the librarians viewing the concept mapping technique as the most efficient and the pilots viewing the verbal protocol technique as the most efficient technique. Although there were not any quality or time differences using the different techniques, the concept mapping technique is recommended based on this study, as compared to both the interview and verbal protocol techniques as a means of reducing the knowledge engineer's workload.

T1  - Individual subject response patterns to textual advance organizers
AN  - 304247839
AB  - This study examines the responses of individual college-level students to advance organizers. Four lessons on chick embryology in fixed sequence were presented individually in a self-study mode to 39 subjects enrolled in a college-level biology course using an A-B-A-B design. Each lesson was followed by a test, and each lesson was preceded by either an advance organizer (AO) or an irrelevant learning passage (AP) on an unrelated subject. Whether an individual subject received an AO or an AP for a particular lesson was determined randomly, except that each subject received two AOs and two APs during the experiment.    An analysis of variance was used to verify that the four advance organizer passages each performed properly as an advance organizer during the experiment. It was found that all four produced cognitive restructuring, but only the first three enhanced learning; the direction of significance in Unit IV was in the direction of the control group. Much of the discussion in Chapter V is devoted to exploring the possible reasons for the Lesson IV outcome.    A second data analysis was performed, this time independently on the four scores of each individual subject. The four scores of each individual were plotted across events, and the resulting score profiles were classified into one of three categories, depending upon whether the subjects performed consistently better or consistently worse when given an AO than when not, or were essentially unaffected by the AO.    Probabilities for each individual that their particular set of four scores were obtained randomly were calculated using the randomization test form of the t-test. These probabilities were then combined for each of the three groups using the Additive Method of Probability Pooling.    It was found that some students perform consistently better and some perform consistently worse when given AOs, while still other students seem to be consistently unaffected by advance organizers.    It is recommended that future researchers should use smaller lesson segments, more test points and a greater number of alternations between AOs and APs, and that concept mapping be used to display cognitive reorganizations.

T1  - Studies of contrast: Relationships between subject matter structures and teaching
AN  - 304243202
AB  - This dissertation presents case studies of two teachers participating in the Summer Science Institute at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. There were four research questions for this project. What concepts do two instructors identify as central within their respective areas of expertise-animal behavior or exercise physiology? What relationships do the instructors construct among these concepts? How do interactions with students affect the instructor's subject matter structure (SMS)? How does subject matter structure affect interactions with students? The methods of data collection consisted of individual interviews, classroom observations, personal journals, and concept mapping exercises. Students also wrote about classroom activities and interactions. Transcripts of audiotapes, content analyses of these transcripts, and comparisons of concept maps made up the major part of the analysis. Both participants were involved in the examination of transcripts, the creation of codebooks, and the analysis of the data. There were six major findings in this study. First, past experiences (academic, personal, social, and informal) had profound effects on the content and structure of the concept maps. Second, core concepts for teaching and core concepts for research differed in terms of complexity and detail. Third, students' interpretations of relationships among core concepts affected the participants' concept maps. Fourth, classroom activities were consistent with the participant's philosophy regarding the concept map. If the concept map was rigid, then the activities confirmed the core concepts. If the map was fluid, then the activities were more exploratory. Fifth, the participants employed several voices throughout their planning, teaching, and reflections. Sixth, both participants moved toward a more fluid model of core concepts over the course of ten weeks. The overriding concern is the interaction between subject matter and pedagogy. This interaction is referred to as pedagogical content knowledge, that is, knowledge of teaching a particular subject. These questions may provide a better understanding of pedagogical content knowledge within a very specific context--an inquiry-based science classroom.

T1  - The effect of different types of prior knowledge on memory capacity while reading
AN  - 304238736
AB  - Research on text processing has demonstrated the benefit of background knowledge on text comprehension and recall. However, the research has failed to go beyond these findings to examine the nature of the benefits of prior knowledge for text processing. Furthermore, the ways in which different types of prior information may assist processing efficiency have not been evaluated.    This dissertation examines the benefits for text processing efficiency of different types of prior information. Across three experiments, a reading span task was used to evaluate the effect on working memory capacity while reading, when subjects are presented different types of prior information. In Experiments 1 and 2, prior to reading texts in the reading span task format, subjects were presented no prior information, a general advance organiser, a specific advance organiser, a concept map, or the entire text. In Experiment 3 subjects were presented the entire text to read in all three conditions: however, they engaged in different tasks to vary the depth with which they processed the text meaning.    Across all three experiments the different forms of prior information were examined with regard to the manner in which they assisted subjects' working memory and text comprehension. Overall, the experiments revealed that a condition in which subjects read and then reread a text offers the greatest benefits for working memory while reading. In addition, this condition offers the greatest benefits for text recall, although these benefits appear to be limited to low level text information. These findings are evaluated with regard to their applicability to actual reading for learning.

T1  - The effectiveness of concept and software mapping for representing student data and process schema in science
AN  - 304220095
AB  - This study explored the potential of students' science schema. It focuses on two mapping techniques: concept mapping and software mapping. Concept mapping representing data schema was used for assessment of student achievement. Software mapping representing process schema was used to assess students' interactions with the software program. The purposes of the study were: (1) to investigate the relationships between concept mapping and software mapping techniques, (2) to show that software mapping is as effective as concept mapping as a vehicle for defining students' science achievement schemata, and (3) to provide a basis for "standardization" in the assessment of science schema with software use.    The study showed that there is a positive relationship (.84) between concept mapping and software mapping. This relationship supports the notion that these two kinds of techniques can represent schema, and there seems to be a relationship between data and process schema. It could be said that software mapping can be used as a valid and reliable achievement tool as well as concept mapping.    The subjects were divided into two study groups (Group I and Group II) for concept mapping and software mapping activities. The results showed that there is no significant difference between Group I and Group II on concept mapping and software mapping scores. It means that the order of the activity, doing concept mapping or software mapping as a first or second activity, has no effect on the results.    From an information processing perspective, the functional behavior of subjects in the study explained the relationship between observable stimuli (input) and observable responses (output). The protocol analysis showed that an interaction with computer software provided more cognitive activation and stimulation than concept mapping for children. Also, the software mapping application provided more information about science schema than the concept mapping activities during the think-aloud protocols and their analysis.

T1  - An exploratory study of the concept map as an interview tool to facilitate externalization of conceptual understandings associated with global atmospheric change by eighth-grade physical science students
AN  - 304214683
AB  - The main purpose of this study was to determine if an interview that embedded a concept mapping process (POSTIMCI), compared to an interview that did not embed that process (POSTICCI), would result in a significantly (p $<$.05) greater externalization of middle level students' post-instructional understandings about chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and their role in global atmospheric change (GAC). The investigators postulated that a graphic representation of students' structural knowledge, which evolved as the interview progressed, might facilitate knowledge elicitation by extending working memory, triggering spread-of-activation, and enhancing metacognition.    Thirty-six grade eight physical science students were assigned randomly to "type of interview:" POSTIMCI or POSTICCI. All interviews yielded a transcript; a concept may also emerged from each POSTIMCI. Interview data was analyzed against an expert concept map, which explicated what the students' teacher deemed as an ideal post-instructional understanding (ACCORD). The students and teacher also rated the relatedness of eight central concepts from the expert map. These ratings were transformed into Pathfinder Networks, and a measure of similarity (PFNCSI) of each student's to the teacher's net was derived.    Regression analysis revealed that type of interview was not a reliable predictor of ACCORD. Interview processes, scope of topic, and instructional factors may have contributed to these non-significant findings.    PFNCSI and verbal ability (California Achievement Test) each improved significantly (p $\leq$.003) the prediction of ACCORD. A score on the concept maps emergent from POSTIMCI also was a reliable (p =.001) predictor of ACCORD. All students' held the scientific conception that CFCs destroy the ozone layer. However, almost 30% gave evidence of holding the alternative conception that CFCs cause global warming via ozone layer destruction.    Although the type of interview did not predict the externalization of students' understandings, most of the POSTIMCI students perceived that concept mapping was of help in telling what they knew and affected positively their answers to the interview questions. These perceptions cut across gender and ability level. The findings of this study support the use of PFNCSI, and concept maps constructed during interviews, as valid indicators of the degree to which students' hold an ideal post-instructional understanding.

T1  - The effective use of analogies in earth science
AN  - 304213894
AB  - This study examined the effect of prior knowledge and teaching method on the learning of earth science concepts with analogies. Research questions looked at whether greater conceptual learning occurred with analogies when learners had prior knowledge of the subject and when learners were explicitly taught the limitations of the analogy. Research questions also examined whether identified misconceptions increased or decreased after analogy instruction. Concept maps and a multiple-choice test were used to assess prior knowledge, detect misconceptions, and assess conceptual knowledge. An additional example-non-example test was also used as a post-test. Experimental groups did significantly better than a non-instructional control group on the multiple-choice assessment. The experimental group also had significantly higher post-test than pre-test scores. Significant differences between the prior knowledge and teaching method groups were not detected on the multiple-choice and concept map assessments. However, a significant interaction between prior knowledge and teaching method was detected on the example-non-example test. The source of this interaction was in the high prior knowledge groups. The high prior knowledge group taught with the no-limitations teaching method had a higher mean score than the high prior knowledge group taught with the limitations teaching method. The various assessments highlighted some possible misconceptions such as the plates being viewed as a layer separate from the crust and/or mantle, and raised questions about the objective quantification of those misconceptions. Assessment of prior knowledge, differences between analogy teaching method groups, and problems scoring concept maps were also discussed.

T1  - Gulf literacy: A marine science-based model of scientific literacy
AN  - 304210828
AB  - A trend in science education reform is the move towards the goal of scientific literacy. Attributes of scientific literacy include: (a) understanding key concepts and principles of science; (b) understanding newspaper articles and graphics related to science issues; and (c) using scientific ways of evaluating evidence for individual and societal purposes (AAAS, 1989; Demastes & Wandersee, 1992). Furthermore, BSCS (1993) has proposed a model of biological literacy that includes four distinct levels (nominal, functional, structural, and multidimensional).    The Gulf of Mexico and its coastal environments are of social, economic and scientific importance. An understanding of the Gulf of Mexico in terms of its history, ecology, natural resources, economic impact, and fragility should be part of K-12 science education.    The following research questions formed the framework of this study: (1) Can a meaningful model of Gulf literacy be developed? (2) Does the model have instructional utility? (3) What level of Gulf literacy can high school students achieve using this booklet?    A model of Gulf literacy was developed through content analysis of coastal newspapers and expert interviews. A series of concept maps were produced as a conceptual framework of Gulf literacy. A curriculum guide emphasizing graphics was developed for a two-week unit on the Gulf of Mexico. Students' development of Gulf literacy was assessed by interviews, concept mapping, and questionnaire.    Students in this study were emergent with respect to reaching a level of multidimensional literacy as described by the BSCS. Students' conceptual understanding of the Gulf of Mexico was well founded for human impacts related to Gulf, marine animals, and trophic structure. An understanding of Gulf physiographic concepts was dependent upon what exercises the teacher actually utilized. However, physical/chemical processes were poorly understood (possibly due to teacher selection of activities and the existence of critical junctures such as the one at the concept of dead zones). Concept mapping was shown to be generative based on the addition of student supplied concepts on concept maps. Use of microscale models of scientific literacy such as this Gulf literacy model may help inform the larger scientific literacy reform efforts.

T1  - An investigation of the environmental literacy of teachers in south-central Ohio using the Wisconsin Environmental Literacy Survey, concept mapping and interviews
AN  - 304204193
AB  - Environmental literacy is a concept that has been used a great deal in the past several years. Educators and politicians have called for an environmentally literate citizenry. But what is environmental literacy? How do we achieve it in an individual, let alone an entire citizenry? Can we measure environmental literacy in a meaningful way? These questions and others formed the basis for this research. This research used both quantitative and qualitative techniques to explore individual construction of environmental knowledge, values, and behavior.    The level of environmental literacy was examined for teachers in an eight county region of southern Ohio. Fifty-four teachers were randomly sampled and mailed the Wisconsin Environmental Literacy Survey (forty-seven completed and returned the survey). Six teachers, three with high environmental literacy and three with lower environmental literacy, were asked to participate in concept mapping, interviews and self-rating.    The Wisconsin Environmental Literacy Survey was found to be a good measure of the environmental literacy of a large group, but it failed to accurately measure the environmental literacy of some individuals. Alternative forms of assessment to gather individual information about environmental literacy proved useful. In particular, interviews and concept mapping provided details about the cognitive construction of ecological principles and environmental literacy in individuals. Partial analysis of the concept maps was done using SemNet software. These qualitative approaches generally agreed with the Survey, but of the six teachers involved in Phase II of the study one was underrated and one was slightly overrated by using the Survey results alone. In addition, the qualitative approaches uncovered a major gag in the teachers' knowledge of ecological systems. The role and importance of energy in natural environments was missing from concept maps and interview responses. Another finding of the study was the importance of early childhood experiences in natural environments with adult role models.    Recommendations from this study include continuation of multiple approaches to assessing environmental literacy, infusion of energy concepts into basic ecology instruction, expansion of the use of concept maps in environmental education and exploration of the role of early childhood experiences in the development of environmental literacy.

T1  - The reality of stakeholder groups: A study of the validity and reliability of concept maps
AN  - 304202034
AB  - Most evaluations of social programs in the United States have been disappointing. This situation has led many evaluation theorists to call for efforts directed at developing the theory of any given program, hopefully before the program is even implemented, so that the logic of what is to be changed, why, and why and how the program is expected to produce these changes is clear from the outset. The expectation is that both better programs and better program evaluations will result.    One tool that has recently appeared is called concept mapping. Participants discuss the program or anticipated program and brainstorm statements or phrases about the program. These statements or phrases, usually after some editing, are placed on cards for participants to sort into piles in a way that makes sense to them. Sometimes participants rate the statements or phrases, if a rating is desired. The piles of cards are then submitted to analysis by multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis. The result is statements clustered in terms of what consensus may exist among the persons sorting the cards and a graphical representation of these clusters, called a concept map.    The six reliability indices recommended by Trochim (1993) were computed and compared with values reported by Trochim, and participants were presented with three map and clustered statement list alternatives and asked to choose the one that made the most sense to them.    Reliability coefficients were generally lower than those reported by Trochim (1993), but the pattern of lowest to highest coefficient was somewhat similar. The Faculty participant subgroup systematically chose the Community subgroup map and statement clusters, and this pattern was statistically significant. There was no systematic map choice for the Community subgroup or for all participants as a whole.    A majority, though not statistically significant number, of participants reported that only the statements were useful in making the choice of which map/statement cluster list combination made the most sense.    This study was, however, limited to fairly brief interactions with participants. A number of specific recommendations are made for future studies.

T1  - Learning to teach without teacher preparation: A case study of two beginning high school science teachers
AN  - 304197629
AB  - Many concerns have been raised about the quality of teaching in schools. One proposal is to reduce the amount of formal preparation prospective teachers need. This suggestion should be evaluated carefully to determine whether teachers with minimal or no formal preparation are able to do the work of teaching in ways that respond to concerns raised about the teaching profession.    This study followed two high school science teachers throughout their first year of teaching. Neither had had formal teacher preparation. The study focused on how they understood and managed the role of teacher and the tasks of teaching, and how they viewed their students.    Three techniques were used in data collection: interviews, observation, and concept maps. Extended interviews were done at the beginning, middle, and end of the school year. During these the participants constructed concept maps on the topic of teaching. Shorter interviews were done bi-weekly following a day of classroom observation.    While the participants fit easily into the outward role of a teacher, they had difficulty knowing how to help students learn. Both participants assumed that if a student listened in class and did the work, then that student would learn the material. They did not know how to assist a student who had difficulty in class.    The schools had a significant impact on how the participants viewed the work. Because they fit easily into the school, the participants had no reason to question or change how they taught. No one at the schools raised any other possibilities for how to do the work than what the participants were already doing.    This study raises questions about the efficacy of hiring teachers who do not have teacher preparation. Those who are calling for more subject matter background and less pedagogical background are expecting that change to make a difference in student learning. The participants of this study, however, did not have the knowledge and skills to effectively help all students learn the material. This study also points to the importance of having schools be active participants in efforts to reform teaching and improve learning for all students.

T1  - Concept mapping by preservice elementary teachers: A case study of the effects in an integrated methods course
AN  - 304192630
AB  - Science education in the United States is presently undergoing examination and change in response to poor student performance on nationwide achievement tests (Suter, 1992). Reforms in mathematics and science education stress the importance of helping students develop active linkages between disciplines (NCTM, 1989; Rutherford & Ahlgren, 1990). The challenge facing educators at all levels is incorporation of recent research and reform recommendations into existing programs. University educators must help preservice teachers learn meaningfully so they can become effective in helping their students to do the same (Beyerbach & Smith, 1990; Hoz, Tomer & Tamir, 1990). It has been demonstrated in isolated disciplines that the use of metacognitive tools like concept maps can help all teachers construct knowledge and develop attitudes favorable for such goals (Roth & Roychoudhury, 1993). Concept mapping, as described by Novak (1984), appears to be a useful approach to instruction and assessment in an integrated mathematics/science/social studies course because of its graphic representation of knowledge construction and explicit portrayal of the linkages between concepts.    The purpose of this research was to examine the effectiveness of concept mapping as an alternative form of instruction and assessment, in an integrated mathematics/science/social studies elementary methods course. The participants in the study were seventh semester education majors enrolled in the integrated, elementary methods course at The University of Connecticut during the fall semester of 1994. A case study approach was used to create a rich picture of the strategy's impact on student knowledge construction. Triangulated data included interviews, participant observation field notes, student and instructor constructed concept maps, and a researcher reflexive journal.    The results of this study appear consistent with those of previous research. Developing concept maps enhanced some students' reflective processes enabling them to engage in a more meaningful learning process. Creating concept maps forced some students to organize their thoughts, look for meaningful connections and acknowledge their own deficits. In addition, some students gained a better understanding of how they, and others, thought about connecting concepts in integrated activities. For many of the preservice teachers concept maps provided an effective vehicle for sharing their understandings.

T1  - Investigating the general and mathematics efficacy and attributions of African-American students, as predictors of pursuit of mathematics-related careers
AN  - 304186254
AB  - The efficacy expectations and attributions for success and failure of African American 12th graders, for general academics and mathematics, were investigated in this study. The participants consisted of 61 African American high school seniors from a school in middle Georgia.    Quantitative and qualitative methods were used. The study included three phases--the testing phase, the student interview phase, and the parent interview phase. The instruments used in the testing phase were the (a) biodata and mathematics history form, (b) Academic Self-Concept Scale (Reynolds, 1988), (c) Mathematics Self-Efficacy Scale (Betz & Hackett, 1983), (d) Intellectual Achievement Responsibility Scale (Crandall, Katkovsky, & Crandall, 1965), (e) Mathematics Attribution Scale (Wolleat, Pedro, Becker, & Fennema, 1980), and (f) Sources of Mathematics Efficacy Scale (Lent, Lopez, & Bieschke, 1991). In the student interview phase, four male and three female students were chosen to be interviewed according to gender, mathematics achievement, and pursuit or nonpursuit of mathematics-related careers. In the parent interview phase, four parents were interviewed.    Analysis of variance and correlational comparisons were used to analyze the quantitative data. The predictor variables were (a) gender, (b) mathematics achievement, (c) family status, (d) parents' educational level, and (e) career choice. The predictor variables were each compared with (a) general academic efficacy, (b) mathematics efficacy, (c) general academic attributions, (d) mathematics attributions, and (e) sources of mathematics efficacy information. The interview data were made into concept maps, and concept comparison was used to analyze the data.    The findings indicated that high mathematics self-efficacy predicts pursuit of mathematics-related careers. Factors that were likely to predict high mathematics self-efficacy for the participants in this study, were high mathematics performance accomplishments, low mathematics anxiety, high general academic efficacy, and a mother with a college degree. Mastery-oriented attributions for success and failure (Kloosterman, 1984b) were found to predict the listed factors. All of the given factors need not be present in African Americans who pursue mathematics-related careers. Other mediating factors include parents, as well as other people or organizations, which encourage and instill in the children a value for education and confidence in their academic abilities.

T1  - The effects of student-constructed concept maps on achievement in a first-year college instructional chemistry laboratory
AN  - 304181071
AB  - Instructional science laboratories are important in the training of non-science and science students, because in these laboratories students learn how to explore the natural world. The quality of chemistry laboratory instruction has been declining due to rising costs, safety concerns, and an emphasis on manipulative skills. Traditionally, there have been few instructional strategies which promote conceptual understanding by laboratory students. The problem addressed by this study is that first-year college chemistry students learn very little of the conceptual material associated with chemistry experiments they perform.    The construction of concept maps, based on the constructivist learning theory, is a technique previously developed to help students learn the conceptual material associated with laboratory work. The thesis of this research is that the construction of a prelab concept map, and the restructuring of this map during and after the laboratory period, help students understand the concepts involved in the experiments they perform.    The study was conducted using 32, all female, non-science majors enrolled in a first-year chemistry course covering general and organic chemistry. Only the laboratory portion of the course was used in this study. The experimental group constructed prelab and postlab concept maps, while the control group wrote essays explaining the conceptual chemistry of the four experiments used in this study. Both groups took 25-item achievement tests one week after each experiment. The experimental group turned in prelab and postlab concept maps, which were scored and evaluated for significant differences. Five students in the experimental group were interviewed at the end of the semester to investigate their perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in chemistry laboratories.    No significant differences were found between treatment groups with respect to students' conceptual understanding as determined by the multiple-choice achievement tests. With the exception of the first experiment, students constructed significantly more complex concept maps after they had listened to the introductory laboratory instruction and completed the experiment, than before coming to lab having only read the experiment handout. The construction of a prelab concept map, with subsequent restructuring inlab and postlab helps students understand the concepts of the experiments they perform.

T1  - Pedagogical content knowledge revisited: The role of folk theory in learning to teach
AN  - 304181023
AB  - Current thinking in the reform of teacher education often turns toward increasing the subject matter knowledge of teachers, an enterprise to be achieved through advanced study in a university-based discipline. The epistemological assumptions behind this and related notions are explored in this study, with special focus on the Shulman model of pedagogical content knowledge. I trace the year-long experience of six candidates for the M.A.T. degree at Boston University, a program which embodies the same epistemological assumptions as the Shulman model. The six candidates were chosen from six different disciplines, three from the humanities and three from the sciences. Data collection was based heavily on periodic interviews, concept maps drawn at the beginning and end of the program, field observations, and the examination of written work and teaching presentations. I found that all six participants were in possession of personalized folk or egocentric theories of teaching and learning, theories that appeared to have been derived from early learning experiences. Far more than any notions about the structure of the discipline, these unchallenged theories provided the major organizing principles in the thinking of the participants. When the participants began the student teaching practicum, it was the match or the mismatch between the milieu of the school and the folk theory that provided each participant with a subjective evaluation of the experience. A match was the source of self-congratulation whereas a mismatch was the source of self-recrimination. I found the transfer of skills from the university to the classroom to have been significantly impeded by the folk theories supported by heuristic fallacies and by the biases of both the participants and the institutions. The features of the Shulman model could not be discerned in the development of the thinking of the participants. Recommendations are made for faculty development in the discipline, for a greater focus on the improvement of student learning in the School of Education and elsewhere, and for better coordination with the field placement schools.

T1  - Concept mapping as a pre-search activity in the research process
AN  - 304180712
AB  - A qualitative study addressed difficulties students have conducting effective information searches in research assignments. The setting was an automated library of an independent school in Europe. Ten biology students were chosen by purposive sampling; user profiles monitored students' ages, computer experience, native language, grades and test scores. An experimental group used concept mapping while a control group received the same classroom instruction without mapping. Data on searching behavior were collected using think-alouds, interviews, debriefing and journals. Analysis explored how concept mapping affected subject and key word searching in full-text and index databases of print and electronic search tools; how it influenced search strategies; how librarian and teacher expert searches differed; how student searching related to stages of the search process. The Fano measure from information theory showed there was a greater probability that concept mappers will use print rather than electronic means, that they will search in the electronic SIRS rather than the OPAC, that in electronic searching they will use subject heading rather than key word. In print, as opposed to electronic searching, measures showed mappers had a larger number of search terms, employed opening moves, reformulations, search operations and relevancy judgments more often and executed more depth than breadth searching. In all cases probability measured at least half a nat (one nat equals 2.718), indicating chances were approaching twice as likely that searchers exhibiting these characteristics in print indexes will be mappers. Larger differences between the groups emerged in electronic searching, where mappers spent less time. Quantitative data verified mappers were more thorough and efficient, reformulating by shifting synonyms and moving from general to specific search terms, making more connections among search tools, and terminating searches to read rather than when they depleted their search terms. Stronger focus formulation emerged as the most important determinant of searching behavior. Mappers, more sensitive to the search environment, adjusted their strategies based on metacognitive knowledge that they were more successful in print indexes, searched for new terms and information, and were less sensitive to information overload.

T1  - Construct validation of an approach to modeling cognitive structure of experts' and novices' United States history knowledge
AN  - 304157454
AB  - This research applied evolving conceptions of learning to tackle the difficult problems of how students' and experts' cognitive structures might be represented and evaluated. A diverse sample of high school students was selected to complete several tasks purporting to measure domain-specific knowledge of the Great Depression period of U.S. History, including of prior knowledge, written explanation, similarity ratings and concept mapping tasks. In this study, the technical characteristics of a method for scoring student concept maps were explored by comparing directly the quality of student maps with expert maps. Results showed that experts' concept maps could be used to score students' concept maps reliably. Further analyses showed that students who judged similarities of pairs of concepts, facts, and events from the Great Depression era in an expert-like manner constructed more correct links for those same pairs in their concept maps. MIMIC structural modeling was used to analyze relationships among causal and indicator measures of the construct "Cognitive structure." Two concept mapping measures (semantic content score, organizational structure score) and two writing task dimensions (content quality and argumentation) were chosen to represent indicators of the construct. The findings provided some evidence to support the theoretical position that domain-specific measures, not general achievement measures, predict performance on those construct indicators.

AN  - 304173348
AB  - This study was undertaken in order to provide a definition of mentoring in the context of nursing. Roy's (1976) adaptation model provided a conceptual framework for examining mentoring and its relationship to adaptive behavior among nurses. Concept mapping provided a unique method of grounded research involving graduate and undergraduate nursing students enrolled in a professional issues course at a small private college. A definition of the concept of womentoring is proffered, including in it the key concepts identified by the study participants.

T1  - Conceptual development in physical therapy students
AN  - 304154089
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate processes used by physical therapy students in developing conceptual knowledge in physical therapy. Qualitative methods were used to collect data during a 15-week course entitled "Kinesiology for Physical Therapists." The sample was 10 first-year physical therapy students enrolled in an entry-level master of physical therapy program. Data were collected using open-ended interviews, concept maps, observation, and journals kept by the students throughout the course. Results revealed several major themes, including use of dialogue, use of visualization, use of experience, and integration of anatomy and kinesiology. Additional findings included experience- and age-related differences in conceptual development and two patterns of conceptual development during the kinesiology course. A model of conceptual development was also presented that depicts conceptual learning as an active, evolving process. The results of this study provide support for use of the senses, dialogue, authentic contexts, whole-part-whole learning, and the cognitive apprenticeship model in physical therapy education.

T1  - Assessing conceptual change through concept mapping
AN  - 304147508
AB  - This study used a microgenetic methodological approach to investigate the power of concept mapping to detect daily changes in learners' cognitive structures. Nineteen mathematics and science teachers attending a five-day symbolism on fractals, chaos, and dynamics constructed a series of five concept maps. The first concept map was drawn prior to the beginning of the symbolism, and the remaining four concept maps were drawn after each day of instruction.    Concept maps were scored using a scoring algorithm developed by Novak and Gowin in 1984. Scores were used to quantify changes in subjects' conceptions of subject-matter content over the five days of the symbolism. Conceptual change was measured by subjects' use of propositions, levels, cross links, and a summary score.    Subjects' attitudes toward concept mapping also were assessed. Subjects responded to a questionnaire concerning (a) their desire to learn more about concept mapping, (b) their intent to use concept mapping in the future, and (c) the advantages and disadvantages of concept mapping as an assessment tool and as a learning tool. Subjects also completed a semantic differential scale eliciting affective responses regarding their perceptions of concept mapping.    Data were analyzed to determine the quantitative changes in subjects' concept maps and the associated trends. Multivariate analysis of variance techniques revealed significant differences (p $<$.05) in means across the five days for each dependent variable (propositions, levels, cross links, and summary scores). Orthogonal polynomial contrasts identified a linear trend (p $<$.001) for each of the dependent variables across time. Helmert contrasts detected daily differences (p $<$.05) in means for all dependent variables except levels. Analysis of the semantic differential scale indicated a global acceptance of concept mapping. Subjects expressed a desire to learn more about concept mapping and an intent to use concept mapping in the future.    The results of this study support the use of concept mapping as a technique for measuring conceptual change. The use of concept mapping provides an alternative method of assessment for educators interested in understanding the development of learners' conceptual understanding of subject-matter content.

T1  - Effects of sequencing supplanted concept maps and generating concept maps on recall of structural knowledge presented in a CAI lesson for nursing students
AN  - 304138152
AB  - Concept maps have enhanced learning in a variety of settings, with diverse populations, and more recently with computer based instruction. An important question for instructional designers is whether the concept map can successfully be used within computer based instruction, and, if so, what are the most effective ways in which to use this strategy to facilitate learning? This experimental study asked if nursing students' use of concept maps supplied by the computer, either in advance of the lesson or following the lesson, would effect learning outcomes. In addition, the study asked if generating a concept map would influence learning. Additional variables of academic achievement and prior knowledge were assessed.    Two measurements of achievement on posttests were collected--immediately following the computer assisted lesson and one month later. On the immediate posttest, subjects in the control group scored higher than subjects in the post system supplanted treatment and the generated treatment groups. No significant differences on delayed posttest performance were found across the groups, although the control group was the only group to demonstrate a decline in performance. Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a movement in the direction of significance of this finding.    Subjects with high academic ability did not appear to benefit from the concept mapping strategy in any of the treatment modalities. Prior experience among the control group may have influenced performance on the immediate posttest, but did not demonstrate the same effect on the delayed posttest. The influence of prior knowledge remains a significant factor in learning.    The present study indicated that concept mapping within a CAI lesson can produce measurable gains in achievement. Replication of the study is needed to contribute to the research base for effective use of the concept mapping strategy in CAI design.

Key shortcomings of traditional static maps include lack of access to the data on which a map is based, a general lack of tabular and graphic views of the data, inability to rapidly reclassify the data, difficulty in comparing two or more maps of the same or related data sets, and inability to adequately show geographic change over time. Despite the coming of age of personal computers, much of the map display software that has been developed fails to go beyond digital representations of static maps.    What is needed is interactive map display software that gives map users tools to visually explore a map and its underlying data. This dissertation addresses that need through the development of a choropleth map exploration system, ExploreMap. The goals of the ExploreMap project were threefold: (1) to develop "proof-of-concept" map exploration software, (2) to provide a working map exploration system for teachers and researchers, and (3) to serve as a stimulus for future developments in spatial data exploration software. An important element of the design philosophy for ExploreMap was that the user interface itself is part of the electronic map.    ExploreMap version 1.0 was subjected to evaluation by expert users in individual sessions and in conference and seminar presentations and in classroom use. Based on feedback received, ExploreMap underwent two revisions and was published in the Annals of the Association of American Geographers(1992) as version 1.2. A second round of revisions involved individual use sessions, in which 15 experts responded to a written questionnaire, followed by small focus group sessions. Based on responses received from the questionnaires and the focus groups, final revisions were made, resulting in ExploreMap 2.0. Significant map exploration features in ExploreMap include the ability to view a map's elements in sequence, to view individual classes or combinations of classes, to select and highlight selected subsets of the data, to instantly reclass the data and view the results on the map and in a variety of graphic forms, and to compare up to four maps of the same data set simultaneously.

T1  - A comparison of the effects of multiple visual examples and nonexamples versus prototypical examples on science concept learning: An exploratory study based upon the concept of photosynthesis
AN  - 304130668
AB  - Two researcher-produced, standard-length videos on photosynthesis (and accompanying ancillary materials) were developed with the input of educators and content experts. The control treatment video script contained the standard number of prototypical examples and graphics based high school textbooks. The experimental treatment video script was based on the theory of conceptual change. Two student focus groups met daily for one week and reviewed portions of the original experimental treatment script for clarity, brevity, and choice and placement of examples and nonexamples. Their suggestions and conceptual change have implications for curriculum design.    The main research question of this study was: Do students learn more from a biology video supplemented with small-multiple examples and nonexamples than one with prototypical examples? The experimental treatment group students performed significantly higher on a subject knowledge posttest than did the control treatment group students (p $<$.05).</p>    Three research questions were included in this study. The first subquestion was: Do students of high, medium, or low ability learn more from a biology video supplemented with small-multiple examples and examples and nonexamples than one with prototypical examples? The second subquestion was: Do students of high, medium, or low ability retain more from a biology video supplemented with small-multiple examples and nonexamples than one with prototypical examples? The third research subquestion was closely related: Do high, medium, or low ability students' concept maps exhibit greater concept elaboration and stronger linkages between concepts from a biology video supplemented with small-multiple examples and nonexamples than one with prototypical examples?    The experimental treatment group students performed significantly higher on a retention test than the control treatment group students (p $<$.05). The high-ability students in both the control treatment and experimental treatment group showed no appreciable differences in their concept maps. However, the medium ability experimental treatment students' concept maps showed a greater depth of knowledge about photosynthesis and more precise linkages between concepts than the maps of the control treatment group students. The low-ability experimental treatment students' concept maps revealed a blend of their previous alternative conceptions and the scientifically acceptable knowledge about photosynthesis.

T1  - Learning strategies and their influence upon students' conceptions of science literacy and meaningful learning: The case of a college chemistry course for non-science majors
AN  - 304127415
AB  - The importance of science literacy is widely acclaimed, yet studies continually decry its decline. Colleges cultivate science literacy through core curriculum requirements, but disagreements regarding what skills, knowledge, and attitudes constitute science literacy provide little instructional guidance. Nevertheless, the essence of science literacy embodies scientific knowledge applicable to social, economic, and political circumstances. The inability of the core curriculum to cover all such knowledge or circumstances suggests the importance of teaching students to learn how to learn meaningfully.    Theory postulates that learning occurs when teachers and students explicitly share their expectations and understandings, i.e., they value shared meaning. Furthermore, meaningful learning requires a conscious commitment by the learner to integrate new concepts into existing knowledge.    Therefore, this interpretivist inquiry investigated student conceptions of science literacy and meaningful learning in the context of a core curriculum course for nonscience majors. A questionnaire assessing learning strategies showed students in this course moved away from rote memorization toward meaningful learning.    Semi-structured interviews with a sample of twenty-two students, stratified by both gender and score on the learning strategies questionnaire, were transcribed, and concept maps were made. The transcripts were coded and a category system representing learning and science literacy as exyerienced by nonscience majors was developed.    The students described learning and science literacy in strikingly similar terms, with substantive differences between rote and meaningful learners and between males and females within these two learning strategies. Rote males viewed learning and science literacy in terms of the amount of knowledge they had, whereas their female counterparts emphasized the processes of receiving such knowledge. Meaningful male learners spoke not of passive processes, but rather of making connections between knowledge they had and knowledge they wanted to learn. Meaningful females focused on making connections between domains of knowledge, e.g., biology and chemistry, with hopes for applying their knowledge and solving problems. Contextual interpretation of these conceptions of learning and science literacy showed that a core curriculum making explicit commitments to shared meaning and incorporating opportunities for meaningful learning provided students a skill broadly transferable to science literacy: learning how to learn.

T1  - A study of concept mapping in a college-level cell biology course
AN  - 304126135
AB  - The intent of this study was to investigate the achievement, attitudes, concerns and perceptions of college-level cell biology students involved in a concept mapping learning strategy. The research design allowed for a comparison between experimental and control groups in regard to achievement. A t-test, applied at the.05 level of significance, revealed that there was no significant difference between experimental and control group mean scores on an achievement exam (t =.110; p =.914).    In addition to quantitative data, qualitative data was collected to investigate experimental group participants' attitudes, concerns, and perceptions regarding the concept mapping strategy. Most experimental group participants had not had prior experience with the concept mapping strategy. Likewise, most participants desired an instructor-generated list of key concepts to guide their map-making. A majority of experimental group participants agreed that the concept mapping strategy aided them in drawing connections between concepts, provided them a way to gain an integrated understanding of the subject matter, helped their retention of subject matter, and made them more active than passive learners. Many experimental group participants constructed concept maps collaboratively and, in turn, suggested that collaborative concept mapping be infused within the cell biology course in the future. A subgroup within the experimental group (n = 5) had neutral to negative views regarding the concept mapping strategy and did not realize success in map construction. This subgroup had a mean score of 60.0 on the achievement exam, while other experimental group members (n = 15) had a mean score of 87.2.    Most experimental group participants in this study cited the laboratory component of the cell biology course as the most beneficial course component.

T1  - Taiwanese students' epistemological commitments and research knowledge construction
AN  - 304121286
AB  - This research was designed to examine Taiwanese Cornell graduate students' epistemological commitments and their ways of research knowledge construction, and to investigate the nature of any relationship between their epistemological commitments and knowledge construction.    This research was guided by Novak's "Human Constructivism" which addresses a constructive perspective on education with a unity of psychological and epistemological meaning making. Thus, this research encompassed both psychological theories of cognitive learning and epistemological beliefs about scientific knowledge.    Ausubel's assimilation theory of cognitive learning and Gowin and Novak's meaningful learning provide the basis for the psychological perspective on cognitive learning of this research. Nussbaum's analysis of philosophical perspectives, Lincoln and Guba's distinctions between postpositivism and naturalism, and Edmondson's categorization of logical positivism and constructivism form the base for the discussion of epistemological beliefs in this research.    This research included a questionnaire survey and two interviews. Its methodology was qualitatively oriented. It relied on descriptive analyses of survey results and interview transcripts, rather than hypothesis testing.    The students' epistemological commitments were revealed through their responses to questions that identified six core factors: observation, inquiry process, data, inquiry results, knowledge, and the development and growth of knowledge, which were adapted from Edmondson's questionnaire. This research showed that the students expressed different epistemological beliefs about different core factors, so their overall epistemological commitments were not consistent.    Concept mapping and Gowin's epistemological Vee were incorporated with interviews to study the students' research knowledge construction. Basically, their research knowledge construction was methodologically oriented, which emphasized more methodological issues but paid less attention to the influences of theoretical issues. However, their studies were still theory-driven because their research was conducted within certain "paradigms" in which the theories, philosophies, and world views of their research were imposed.    Overall, the students held moderate positions while discussing epistemological issues, but they adopted a firmly logical positivist view to construct their research knowledge. This suggested the dominance of logical positivism in school education and research settings; however, that their moderate position on epistemological issues showed their awareness of the constructivist perspective.

T1  - Changes in context and learning: An evaluation of a computer nutrition education program for middle school students
AN  - 304121151
AB  - An integrated computer assisted instruction (CAI) nutrition education program that used nutrition issues to teach skills from the core subject areas, including science, math, social studies, language arts, and health was developed and tested with sixth grade students. The program, entitled "Ship to Shore," was based on a story of one of Columbus' voyages to South America. Students served as apprentices to Columbus, and were asked to solve problems related to vitamin deficiencies (specifically Vitamin C and Vitamin D), starvation, and dehydration. Students worked together in small groups to complete the program. Qualitative methods, including semi-structured, in-depth interviews, and observation were used to collect the data. A process evaluation model, that integrated change and context, was developed to evaluate the CAI program. A pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design was used to evaluate learning. Learning was conceptualized as changes in knowledge structures, which were assessed by constructing concept maps from the interview data. Repeated Measures ANOVAs indicated that treatment group students learned a significant amount about vitamins (p $<$.0001), but not about starvation or dehydration. The characteristics of the lessons that helped students learn were: fantasy; sounds and animations; problem solving activities; and appropriate graphics. Secondly, the environment created by CAI was assessed through grounded theory analysis of the observational data. The observational data collection was focused on interaction between the student and computer, interaction between peers, and the students' thinking and learning skills. Five "Student Styles" of interaction were defined by the grounded theory analysis (n = 32). These included: (1) Dominant Directors (19%), (2) Passive Actors (16%), (3) Action-Oriented Learners (22%), (4) Content-Oriented Learners, (25%), and (5) Problem Solvers, (16%). The "Student Style" groups were gender specific. The Dominant Directors and Passive Actors were girls, and the Action-Oriented Learners and Content-Oriented Learners were boys. The Problem Solvers were mixed gender. The results of this study indicate that students have different goals, purposes, and approaches to CAI. Attention to the differences between students, as well as the similarities, should be considered in the design and evaluation of CAI programs.

T1  - The effects of using concept mapping to supplement class notes on the biology test scores of seventh-grade students in Taiwan, R.O.C.
AN  - 304116545
AB  - This research was conducted to determine the effect of a concept mapping learning supplement on seventh grade students' biology test scores. Three groups of junior high school students in T'ucheng, Taiwan were studied: one group was instructed using outlining and concept mapping studying strategies, the second group was instructed using outlining strategy only, and in the third group no special studying strategies were used. The students' achievement in teacher-made biology examinations was used as the dependent variable to examine the effects of the treatments. The interactions between students' math ability, verbal ability, and gender and the treatments were also analyzed.    The major findings are: (1) while controlling students' verbal ability as the covariate, there was a significant difference among the Examination II scores of the outlining, concept mapping, and control groups, (2) while controlling students' math ability as the covariate, there was a significant difference among the Examination II scores of the outlining, concept mapping, and control groups, (3) students who had some exposures to the concept mapping strategy but did not fulfill the homework assignment scored lowest, and (4) the concept mapping strategy was more effective on students with higher math ability while the outlining strategy was more effective on students with lower math or verbal ability.    The concept mapping strategy was not superior than the outlining strategy on low verbal or math ability students. The possible reasons of this fact are: (1) the students did not master the technique of constructing a concept map, they need more time to practice the concept mapping strategy, (2) the students preferred other learning tool, such as the outlining strategy, and (3) the teacher-made test did not test the ability tapped by the concept mapping strategy.

T1  - The validity of concept maps for assessing cognitive structure
AN  - 304114841
AB  - Concept maps are used to assess student comprehension in structured domains such as biology and physics. Numerous studies report that concept mapping training in combination with domain instruction changes students' cognitive structures. However, no reliability data exists for this instrument and validity data is almost nonexistent. This paper examines the reliability and validity of concept maps as an index of cognitive structure.    Three groups of graduate students in statistics and measurement classes served as subjects. The concept mapping trained students learned to draw concept maps prior to domain instruction. The concept mapping untrained students were encouraged to "draw a picture that reflects how you think" but were not trained in concept mapping procedures. The control group learned concept mapping after domain instruction. All groups completed a classroom achievement test, judged the similarity of pairs of concepts, and drew maps or pictorial representations twice after domain instruction.    Maps and pictures were compared to the instructors' concept maps. The more similar a student's map is to the instructors' map, the higher the student's score. Students in the two concept mapping training groups drew maps that were reliable over time. Representations drawn by students in the concept mapping untrained group were not reliable.    Students' concept maps after domain instruction were significantly more similar to the instructor's map than were students' maps prior to domain instruction. The group that received concept mapping training after domain instruction did not differ significantly from the group that was trained before instruction. This result is interpreted as supporting the validity of the concept map as an index of cognitive structure.    The correlation between concept map scores and achievement test scores was fairly strong. This was interpreted as supporting the validity of concept maps. Similar results were found for scGRE Quantitative scores and concept maps. Concept map scores did not correlate with semantic networks generated from students' paired comparison ratings. Reasons for this lack of similarity between concept maps and semantic networks is discussed, along with other findings and limitations.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping on misconceptions about light in fifth graders
AN  - 304111742
AB  - The role of misconceptions in the acquisition of science concepts has been widely studied. The obtrusive nature of misconceptions affects students' ability to learn science. Teachers are seeking ways to facilitate change and to help students acquire appropriate, scientifically held alternatives.    Teachers should be aware of the schemata learners use to develop knowledge bases and identify ways to approach learners who come to their classrooms with these naive theories intact. Instruction can activate schema selection and provide students with the ability to restructure their existing schema where necessary.    Three groups of students were compared. Trained teachers taught three consecutive lessons about the nature of light. Each group received lessons that had varying levels of misconception activation. One group utilized the written, schematic tool of concept mapping to activate their misconceptions. The analyzed data sets indicated that there was no significant difference in the pretest and posttest scores on the unit tests between the groups. Overall, the students showed progress in their test performance, although there was no indication of concept change regarding the nature of light. Speculations and recommendations about the use of concept mapping with elementary students conclude this investigation.

T1  - An assessment of the effects of inquiry instruction on undergraduate biology students' understanding of biological concepts and attitudes about science
AN  - 304097444
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of inquiry instruction as a methodology in teaching undergraduate biology education. The dependent variables in this study were, content understanding, process skills abilities, and science attitudes. Students in an inquiry biology course and a traditional biology course were given pre-test, post test, and extended post test examinations regarding each dependent variable. Qualitative measures accompanied each quantitative instrument to gather more in-depth understanding about students' understanding and attitudes in science.    Results from the post test measures indicated that students participating in an inquiry learning environment, in comparison with other instructional approaches, had an equal understanding of biological concepts, had a greater ability to identify and state hypotheses, and had more positive attitudes about science. Extended assessment measures indicated the gains in students' process skills abilities and attitudes about science were not retained. Findings from this research suggest that without sustained exposure to any instructional approach, positive cognitive and attitudinal changes are not retained by the students.    Qualitative measures were used to further investigate students' understanding in biology and attitudes about science. The use of concept mapping and problem solving interviews in assessing students' understanding of biology was useful in identifying students' higher order thinking skills. Interviews and journal entries described in greater detail the demands an inquiry learning environment places on students and how students applied their inquiry experiences outside the classroom setting.

T1  - Concept mapping the beliefs of chronic low back pain sufferers
AN  - 275958421
AB  - The research related to individuals' beliefs about chronic low back pain have typically been theoretically driven as opposed to incorporating experiential data. In this study, concept mapping, an alternative methodological approach combining qualitative and quantitative strategies, was used to identify and categorize a set of these beliefs. The study consisted of a three phase process. Phase one employed a semi-structured interview to gather belief statements from chronic low back pain sufferers at a rehabilitation facility. A set of 83 belief statements, representing 65 functional, 14 dysfunctional and 4 neutral beliefs, were identified from interviews with eight individuals and by using an interrater agreement process involving four psychologists. In phase two, 48 members of multidisciplinary teams with expertise in the treatment of chronic back pain sorted the belief statements into homogeneous groups. The sorted data were analyzed using multidimensional scaling and cluster analytic techniques to produce a concept map that consisted of seven themes: denial/regret, self-defeating/passive, medications/pain focus, cautious realism, accepting limitations, adaptive coping, and responsibility for rehabilitation. In phase three, a three-part questionnaire was administered to 115 low back pain sufferers at the beginning of their rehabilitation program to determine the prevalence of the beliefs held within this population. The beliefs statements and themes could serve as the basis for the development of treatment plans and as a guide to assess progress during the course of, and following, treatment.

T1  - A high school molecular biology unit for honors introductory biology students in a constructivist classroom
AN  - 230823262
AB  - The purpose of the molecular biology unit was to teach basic DNA science to ninth and tenth grade honors biology students. The unit introduced DNA structure, an historical overview of DNA research, DNA replication, translation, transcription, recombinant DNA technology, and the ethical implications of such technology.    The unit was built around four laboratory activities, four modeling exercises and one class project. The instruction sought to incorporate the elements of constructivist philosophy. An additional goal of the unit was to promote student understanding of metalearning and metaknowledge.    A comparison of pre-test and post-test scores, evaluation of student journal entries, student-prepared concept maps, Vee-heuristic diagrams, entry/exit polls, and cooperative learning group reports showed that student learning was enhanced by the tactics utilized. The students were enthusiastic learners who constructed their own knowledge of molecular biology.

T1  - The use of concept maps as advance organizers in grade seven science
AN  - 193850342
AB  - Concept maps are heuristics for visually representing conceptual systems. The technique is generally associated with Ausubelian views of learning and cognition. The device has potential for use as an advance organizer type of preinstruction. This study compared two systems for organizing and presenting science material: the traditional method as prescribed by the textbook, and an Ausubelian approach that integrates concept maps as advance organizers.    Eighty-nine grade seven students in four classes took part in the study. Pretest scores showed all participating classes were equal. For research purposes, the four classes were then divided into two groups: control (N = 45) and organizer (N = 44).    Organizer group subjects received concept maps and brief oral presentations before lessons. Control group subjects received no preinstruction. Lesson content was the same for both treatment groups. Both groups received six weeks of instruction. A pretest and posttest determined if there was a significant difference between the groups. After the first unit the experimental and control groups were reversed. During the first six-week unit on Living Things, the organizer group scored significantly higher (p =.0195) than the control group. After the second six-week unit on Solutions, similar results were found (p =.013) in favor of the experimental group using a concept map as an advance organizer.    The results of this study found almost a 10% increase in learning of science material. It is concluded that using concept maps as advance organizers for organizing and presenting material is a valid metacognitive heuristic for improving meaningful learning in science.

T1  - The reclamation of intelligence: A task for adult learners
AN  - 304119044
AB  - The PDE identifies "feeling stupid" as a phenomenon which has widespread personal, educational, and political implications but which has been overlooked as a characteristic or phase of adult learning. The "reclamation of intelligence" is identified as a pressing developmental task, a dimension of empowerment, and a transformative process.    Examining "feeling stupid" and "the reclamation of intelligence" from a developmental perspective, the PDE explores relationships between infancy and adult learning; the importance of narrative; the advent of literacy, numeracy and Piagetian conservation; the impact of standardized testing; the dangers of competition; aspects of the adolescent passage; "women's ways of knowing"; and the attainment of wisdom.    In order to explore "feeling stupid" as an experience and an analytical category, and to assist in the "reclamation of intelligence," the author, a Mentor at Empire State College, designed and facilitated an 8-credit group study entitled "A Developmental Approach to Adult Learning." Ten adult learners, all women, participated in the group; they read and wrote extensively, and took part in cooperative and experiential learning activities. Computer generated concept maps suggest that at the beginning of the study, "feeling stupid" was a relatively inchoate litany of paralysis, low self esteem and vulnerability. Subsequent maps, students' writing, and audio transcripts of group meetings indicate that by the end of the study, this concept had developed; i.e. it had become more complex, more coherent, and more dynamic. The group was less embedded in the feeling; more able to treat it as a phenomenon; more confident in their sense of themselves as learners; and indeed, slightly pugnacious in the defense and expression of alternative views of intelligence. The transformation of "feeling stupid" from a personal feeling and experience into a concept with social and political implications with which the students could and did work indicates that in the course of the study, development--and the "reclamation of intelligence" --took place.

T1  - Leadership in nursing administration: The perspectives of senior nurse administrators
AN  - 304097318
AB  - This exploratory and descriptive qualitative research study was designed in order to identify the cognitive maps of leadership for the purpose of theory development in nursing administration. Symbolic interaction theory guided the exploration of the meaning of leadership of six senior nurse administrators (SNAs) who worked in urban, acute care tertiary or community hospitals in one Canadian province. The research methods selected were designed to explore the contextual reality of leadership from the participants' perspective. The research methods included interviewing, concept mapping, and document analysis. Each SNA's leadership concept map was constructed. Four major categories of leadership, reflecting the SNA's perspectives, were identified by means of the constant comparative method of qualitative data analysis: attaining and maintaining competency, information sharing, decision making, and team building. One category of contextual variables which mediated the SNA's leadership perspective was also identified. The research findings were analyzed in relation to theories of leadership and in the context of the domains of nursing proposed by Benner (1984). No one theory encapsulated the entirety of their experience. The findings revealed that the SNAs considered building interpersonal relationships the basis for leadership. The researcher proposes that SNAs lead out of their practice as nurses. SNAs in this study who have learned to care as nurses have incorporated caring as an epistemological system in nursing leadership. The implications for nursing practice, research and education are discussed in this research report.

T1  - Conceptual organization in a learning cycle classroom
AN  - 304085009
AB  - This study was conducted to examine conceptual organization of ninth-grade physical science students who had experienced three learning cycle investigations about simple machines: "Levers," "Balance on a Lever," and "Pulleys." Students in a physical science course were assigned by section to participate in one of three types of expansion phase activities: descriptive, question design, and hypothesis testing. Concept mapping, a concept application task, and a word-sorting activity were used to evaluate conceptual organization. Equivalence among the groups was determined by administering Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning: Revised Edition and the Integrated Process Skills Test. The students' concept maps provided insight into (a) relationships drawn between and among the physical science concepts, (b) dynamics of conceptual organization as students progressed through a series of activities, and (c) spatial patterns students selected to represent their current knowledge structure. Students' responses to the application task showed an increase in the students' ability to use simple machines from pretest to posttest. Five of the 32 students were able to provide a solution in which they (a) sequenced steps in solving the task, (b) communicated a coherent solution to the task, and (c) followed the rules of the task. Students' word sorts showed that they formed groups based on personal experiences. The names chosen by the students for the groups conveyed the context in which the students held the terms. As the students' experiences with simple machines increased, their grouping of terms according to types of simple machines increased.

T1  - A comparison between the use of different concept maps as advance organizers to supplement a unit on photosynthesis in a community college biology course
AN  - 304080074
AB  - This study compared the relative merits of using different concept map presentations as advance organizers in teaching photosynthesis to community college science students. This was done using the Ausubelian approach of concept maps as advance organizers in sequencing and presenting lecture material. The importance of key physical science concepts on the conceptual understanding in non-science majors of the biological process of photosynthesis was also investigated.    The photosynthesis concept maps and photosynthesis physical science concept maps used in this study were developed by the author. Their effectiveness was measured using the Photosynthesis Conceptual Understanding Test. This test was content validated by experts in the field of science and education and the reliability established through two pilot studies.    The subjects in this study were 111 students from six intact biology classes in a southern Mississippi community college. A no concept map control group and two concept map experimental groups were utilized. The experimental design was pretest/posttest. Multiple linear regression analysis was employed to test the hypotheses at the.05 level of significance.    As advance organizers, the photosynthesis concept maps and the photosynthesis physical science concept maps were found to be effective when used for photosynthesis instruction in community college biology classes. No statistically significant overall effects on learning outcome could be attributed to the predictor variables of Piagetian developmental level, educational background, age, and gender.    Aside from their documented usefulness in planning for instruction and in learning to learn, these concept maps were useful in assessing changes in the subject's structural knowledge of photosynthesis.

T1  - The influence of microcomputer-based labs on childrens' conceptions of temperature and temperature change
AN  - 304077632
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine selected fourth-grade students' conceptions about temperature and temperature change before and after they experienced temperature measurement microcomputer-based laboratories (TM-MBL). Eight students were selected for the study by means of a screening test that was designed to identify those students who held specific alternate conceptions about the intensive property of temperature and about the influence of volume on the time for warming or cooling common liquids. Data about individual student conceptions was collected before and after experience with TM-MBL through two-session interviews. The students' TM-MBL experience consisted of five progressive laboratory activities designed to facilitate conceptual change related to the specific alternate conceptions mentioned above. Student conceptions exhibited during the interviews were transformed into individual conceptual inventories for analysis and then into concept maps. After TM-MBL there was favorable conceptual change in a number of areas: fewer students reported that some objects don't have a temperature; more students exhibited a correct conception about the intensive property of temperature; students more often reported correct temperatures on thermal equilibrium tasks; and the perceived influence of the role of air in causing temperature change, in determining equilibrium temperature, and in determining the time for temperature change was reduced. Half of the students improved their conceptions about the influence of volume on the time for temperature change. The students did not however, exhibit clear or accurate conceptions about heat, either before or after TM-MBL. Many suggested heat was a substance that was similar to, or the same as, air. Graphing skills were also examined before and after TM-MBL. The graphing interview questions before TM-MBL did not prove sufficiently robust to adequately determine the students' graph interpretation skills before their lab experience. After TM-MBL, the students were asked questions about some of the graphs that were produced during their lab activities. Responses indicated all the students had sound graph interpretation skills. Based on the findings of the study, implications are suggested for improving classroom practice and for further research.

T1  - The effects of the learning cycle lessons dealing with electricity on the cognitive structures, attitudes toward science and achievement of urban middle school students
AN  - 304077294
AB  - The purpose of this study was to study the effect of the learning cycle instructional strategy on the cognitive structures, achievement and attitudes toward science of urban middle school students. Data were collected from 238 students in 11 classes taught by three teachers. Concept maps, a science attitude inventory and a teacher made unit test were used to gather the data.    Analyses of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the data from each of the instruments. The data showed significant differences (p $<$.05) between control and experimental groups in the measures of cognitive structures and attitude toward science. Differences between control and experimental groups in the measure of the teacher made unit test were not shown to be significant. Further, it was found that there was significant variability in the effectiveness of the learning cycle instructional strategy between teachers using identical lessons.    According to the results obtained from this study, it was concluded that the learning cycle instructional strategy was at least as effective as traditional instructional techniques in delivering content. However, its greatest impacts are in the areas of allowing students to create more accurate and complete cognitive structures of the science content presented and promoting more positive attitudes toward science. Further, the learning cycle can be effective in difficult instructional situations, such as the urban middle schools with high numbers of disadvantaged minorities where this study was conducted.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping on pre-nursing students' ability to recall physiological concepts
AN  - 304074835
AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of two instructional strategies on pre-nursing students' ability to recall physiological concepts. Two computer programs, one using paragraphs and concept maps and another using paragraphs and fill-in-the-blank questions, comprised the instructional strategies. Ausubel's Assimilation Learning Theory was used as the conceptual framework. The sample consisted of 46 pre-nursing students enrolled in an anatomy and physiology course.    A two-group, before-after, quasi-experimental design was used to study the hypotheses. Four intact course sections were randomly assigned to the control (fill-in-the-blank questions) or the experimental (concept mapping) group. The experimental group completed the computer assisted program that used paragraphs and interactive concept maps of specific physiological concepts about fluid volume. The control group completed the computer assisted program that covered the same concepts with paragraphs and fill-in-the-blank questions. The treatment was administered during the laboratory class periods. Both groups received a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a 6-week posttest.    Demographic data about the subjects was obtained by using a questionnaire. A 20-item multiple-choice test was administered as the pretest, immediate posttest, and 6-week posttest. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages and means were used to describe the sample. The alpha level was set at.05 and the hypotheses were analyzed by using a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and an analysis of covariance. The analyses showed no significant differences between the treatment groups in the scores for either the immediate posttest or the 6-week posttest.    In this study, as a method for recalling physiological concepts, concept mapping was no more effective than reading paragraphs and filling in the blanks. Extraneous variables such as prior knowledge, learning styles, achievement motivation, and practice could have contributed to the nonsignificant results. The nonsignificant findings of this study contradicted previous research findings and could possibly be explained by the one-time implementation of the strategy, random assignment of intact classes, and the advanced level of the instruments.

T1  - Concept circle diagrams: A metacognitive learning strategy to enhance meaningful learning in the elementary science classroom
AN  - 304070969
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the use of concept circle diagrams, a newly developed metacognitive strategy (Wandersee, 1987), for meaningful science learning. Two research questions were: (a) Do concept circle diagrams enhance the identification and learning of science concepts more than traditional learning methods? and (b) Do concept circle diagrams evolve in quality within and across three sequences of direct explanation, guided practice, and independent practice? This study builds upon earlier research on two important metacognitive strategies, Vee diagrams (Gowin, 1981) and concept mapping (Novak & Gowin, 1984), used in science education.    Participants were members of two fifth-grade science classes located at a suburban elementary school in southeastern Louisiana. Based on random assignment, classes were identified as the concept circle diagram (CCD) group and the traditional instruction (TRAD) group. First, all students completed two pretests, (a) identifying science concepts in a text passage, and (b) answering a multiple-choice test on their science unit. Then during an eight-week lesson on light and color, the CCD group constructed five sets of diagrams on concepts from science text materials, while the TRAD group completed study guides and participated in group activities. Finally, all students completed the same identification and multiple-choice tests as posttest measures.    Analyses of covariance were used to examine both identification and learning of science concepts measures. While there were no significant differences between groups on identification, the CCD group performed significantly higher on concept learning. In addition, qualitative analyses were used to address the evolution in quality of six students' diagrams. While these students demonstrated improvement on mastery of technique and graphic complexity, only the high achievers improved on conceptual sophistication.    These results provide some support for previous research on the use of metacognitive strategies for meaningful learning. That is, the CCD group may have outscored the TRAD group on the multiple-choice posttest due to their active involvement with this new learning strategy. However, while the two groups performed similarly on the identification measure, this may be due to the unfamiliarity of the text passage used and the task required.

T1  - Effect of concept maps on concept learning and problem-solving achievement in high school chemistry
AN  - 304066358
AB  - Traditionally, numerical problem solving has been the focus in chemistry instruction. However, studies involving college students revealed that students who were successful numerical problem solvers did not understand the concepts behind the problems' solutions. This study investigated chemistry achievement in stoichiometry among high school students. Specifically, achievement in the areas of concept learning, conceptual problem solving, and numerical problem solving was investigated to determine what relationships existed between concept learning and problem solving for these students. Two instructional groups were created. The first was instructed in a traditional manner. The second received instruction identical to the first group with the supplementation of concept mapping activities. All study participants completed assessments in Piagetian, verbal, quantitative, and visual-spatial reasoning. Prior knowledge was also assessed. Because no relationship was found between prior knowledge scores and final achievement scores, prior knowledge was eliminated from the final analyses. A scientific reasoning ability by treatment group interaction was found using the set of stoichiometry achievement test subscores. Students in the concept mapping group with higher scientific reasoning scores outperformed students in the control group in chemistry concept learning. When verbal, visual-spatial, and quantitative reasoning were used as covariates no significant main effect and no interaction effects on chemistry achievement were disclosed. A significant relationship between concept learning and numerical problem solving was found for the concept mapping group only. Concept maps scores did not predict chemistry achievement scores. Quantitative ability did predict concept map scores. These results, like many involving concept maps, are conflicting. The interaction of reasoning ability with treatment group needs to be explored further. Previous studies indicated that the variables of age, duration of concept map usage, and degree of student interaction with concept maps impacted the efficacy of this technique. This study indicated that scientific reasoning ability did the same. The finding of a significant relationship between concept learning and problem solving for the concept map group supports the theory behind the concept mapping strategy. Meanwhile, quantitative reasoning was an important variable even in the concept mapping chemistry classroom.

T1  - Practical inquiry as a tool for creating change in teachers' conceptions of effective teaching
AN  - 304062956
AB  - Many scholars have recommended that teacher education programs engage teachers in reflection and exchange of craft knowledge with their colleagues. Nonetheless, there have been few systematic investigations of these practices. This study addresses that lack by investigating a course, Seminar in Education, designed to encourage teachers to integrate theory with craft knowledge through practical inquiry.    In practical inquiry, teachers with differing amounts of experience and from different subject areas collaborate on real worked tasks. Their own teaching becomes subject for mutual exploration as they contribute perspectives from various fields. Forty-one teachers participated in the summer and fall 1993 classes of Seminar in Education. Subsequent written reflections enabled participants to verbalize their learning and relate it to their lives.    The study examined whether participating in practical inquiry would change these teachers' conceptions of effective teaching. Conceptual change was defined as an increase in or reorganization of prior knowledge. Six dimensions of effective teaching were considered: Personal Characteristics of Teachers, Responsiveness to Students, Academic Content, Pedagogical Principles, Models of Teaching, Awareness of External Influences.    Questions addressed in this study were: What do peers learn from one another? How do teachers' conceptualization of the components of effective teaching change? Do characteristics of the teachers influence their response to practical inquiry? What aspects of practical inquiry are related to conceptual change? How can practical inquiry be most effectively structured?    Primary means of data collection were reflective essays and pre/post concept maps centered on effective teaching. Other instruments used were the Measure of Intellectual development, two Paired Comparison exercises and course evaluations.    Practical inquiry resulted in greater breadth (increased awareness of the role of external factors in teaching effectiveness), and depth (new insights into ones' teaching). Females changed more than males. Science and math teachers changed the least. Prior experience did influence responses. Alternating between small, medium and large groups was effective. Careful pacing was necessary to allow participants freedom to inquire, yet enough structure to reach course goals.

T1  - The effect of conceptually organized materials and computer-assisted instruction on learning about covalent bonding and structure
AN  - 304062594
AB  - Concept maps and other similar methods of representing the conceptual structure of course materials are an effective and efficient means to increase student awareness of the organization of course concepts. However, the effectiveness of using Computer Assisted Instruction (CAI) to present the course's conceptual structure in college-level freshman general chemistry courses with high enrollment has not been reported in the literature. This study focused on the effectiveness of CAI-based Conceptually Organized Materials (COM) in comparison to traditional CAI-based Linearly Organized Lessons chemistry instruction and traditional recitation instruction in chemistry. The study involved 130 students enrolled in eight intact college-level freshman chemistry sections. The sections were randomly assigned to one of six experimental sections in a modified two by three group Solomon experimental design. The results indicated that students who received CAI-based COM performed significantly higher on a validated chemistry concept diagnostic (CCD) instrument compared to students who received the more traditional recitation/lecture lesson. In addition, students who used the CAI-based LOL did not score significantly higher on the CCD instrument than students who received the more traditional recitation instruction. Furthermore, students who used CAI-based COM performed significantly higher on the CCD instrument compared to students who used CAI-based LOL. Finally, students in the CAI-based COM groups spent the same amount of time using the computer lessons in comparison to the students in the CAI-based LOL groups.

The usefulness of concept mapping is well established in the field of education. Current trends in organization development include the emphasis on learning at all levels within an organization. The focus question driving the research was, does concept mapping help in an organization development setting, and if so, how does it help? This question was derived in part from the work of Argyris and Schon (1978) who emphasize that a central problem in organizations is limitations in the ability of those organizations to learn.    The study was carried out in a service organization in a higher educational institution in upstate New York. Nine case studies constitute the basis of this research. From an interview with each employee, I constructed a concept map of the individual's understanding of both her work and salient interactions with other employees. The central episode in each case study was a single concept map-based discussion involving two or three employees. Pre- and post-discussion interviews with the individual employees supplemented the data gathered in the discussion itself. In the concept map-based discussion, employees shared their concept maps of a particular issue, with the goal of cooperatively designing work changes to address specific issues of their own choosing. The research included both 'shop floor' and management employees.    With regard to the outcome of the study, in four of the nine cases participants were successful in making constructive changes to their work, in two cases participants were partially successful, participants in one case were unsuccessful, and two cases were disrupted by a reorganization of the organization during the course of the study. The central finding of the research is that concept mapping allows people to communicate their understanding of their knowledge and to create shared understanding. The technique facilitates both sustained work place changes and improvements in working relationships. Indirectly the study provides validity to the claim that assimilation learning theory can have useful consequences in understanding learning in organizations. From this study it is clear that concept mapping offers great potential for helping organizations effect meaningful learning, thereby facilitating employee decision making and teamwork.

T1  - A concept map based approach to the shared workspace
AN  - 304056950
AB  - This thesis considers concept mapping as a basis for sharing computer workspaces among collaborating partners. The hypermedia paradigm is used both for linkages between concept maps, and for multimedia annotations. The work produced a C++ class library in support of the relevant concept mapping and hypermedia techniques. The library was both motivated by and used to develop a shared workspace Computer Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW) application called Accord. The software was targeted at a business audience and was developed using iterative prototyping and field testing in a large oil company. Informal observation of users working on their own business problems indicates they have no difficulty adopting to concept mapping paradigm.

T1  - The interrelationships of knowledge, context and clinical nursing practice
AN  - 304049524
AB  - This study employed an interpretivist methodology to describe and analyze the interrelationships between knowledge, context and clinical nursing practice.    The content of nursing continuing education programs offered 9-12 months previously was reviewed. Forty semi-structured, tape-recorded interviews were conducted with nurses from hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies to determine their use of this new knowledge. Nurses were asked questions about their learning, their work environment, and their clinical practice. Data were analyzed using computerized data coding, concept maps and matrices.    Nurses identified that knowledge became meaningful in clinical practice when it was relevant to the practice, met the needs of the client, and contained specific content that was deemed helpful. Additionally, the process of constructing a knowledge base was facilitated when the knowledge was reaffirmed, when the individual learner was revitalized, when confidence was increased, and when personal growth was sustained. Finally, nurses identified that knowledge became meaningful when they saw results, engaged in dialogue and networked with colleagues.    Nurses described the structural, political, symbolic and human relations frames of the context in which they worked as having an impact on how they constructed knowledge in clinical practice. The structural frame was seen as a hurdle to be overcome. The human relations frame was seen as positive and facilitating the construction of knowledge. The political frame was used as a screen to filter out new knowledge. Finally, the symbolic frame developed from the political issues in the organization and became imbedded as operating values and assumptions.    Clinical practice affected knowledge through the role that paradigm cases played in both personal and professional growth. Nurses learned to make meaning of such concepts as hope, control, vulnerability, acceptance, respect, loss, persistence, communication, caring, complexity, attachment and families through their clinical practice. Implications for nursing continuing educators, researchers and administrators were drawn.

T1  - Effects of concept mapping on achievement of concrete, transitional, and formal operational community college biology students
AN  - 304044334
AB  - The purposes of this study were to determine if final examination scores, and to determine if there was trait-treatment interaction between learning level of students and treatment as measured by achievement. This study identified cognitive learning levels using Piaget's concrete, transitional, and formal operational levels. The classes used in this study were four introductory biology classes at a community college in a suburban Midwest community.    The experimental treatment group received a combination of lecture, group discussion, and concept mapping. The control group received a combination of lecture and group discussion. The treatment lasted sixteen weeks.    Equivalency of groups was determined by student ACT ASSET scores for reading and writing. The GALT (Group Assessment of Logical Thinking) test was used for cognitive level placement and to determine equivalency between groups.    The final examination, developed by the instructor, was used to measure student achievement. Concept maps completed by the students in the treatment group were scored by the instructor according to evaluation strategies outlined in Joseph Novak and D. Bob Gowin's book Learning How To Learn (1989).    The research design was a post test only control group design. An analysis of variance was used to test for significant differences in final exam scores. An analysis of variance was used to determine whether the experimental group of students, in different levels of cognitive development, had similar concept mapping scores.    Results of the study showed that the effect of concept mapping on achievement was significant at the.002 level of probability. The F value was 10.23. The analysis of variance to determine if there were differences among the experimental group of students at the three levels of cognitive develop showed no significant difference, with an F value of 1.684 and probability of 0.20.    The significance of the results of this study lies in the finding of differential achievement according to whether the students have access to and developed their own concept maps. This study also lends support to the idea that concept mapping can be used successfully by individuals of different cognitive levels.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping and cooperative learning experiences on achievement, transfer problem-solving ability, and attitudes toward the instructional experience of middle school science students
AN  - 304041148
AB  - The purpose of this study was to compare the effects on science achievement, transfer problem solving ability, and attitudes toward the instructional experience for students using concept mapping, cooperative learning, and a combination of concept mapping and cooperative learning in a unit of study. A concept map is a two-dimensional, visual representation of a body of knowledge. Proficiency in concept map construction fosters meaningful learning and positive attitudes toward school and subject. Cooperative learning strategies are structuring techniques for promoting productive student-student interaction in the classroom by creating a situation where each student's success is dependent upon the success of all group members. This study was an investigation of the possibility that a cooperative learning structure can provide the support necessary for middle school science students to experience success with concept mapping.    In this 6-week study, intact classes of middle school science students constructing concept maps in cooperative learning groups were compared with classes constructing concept maps independently and with classes working cooperatively without concept mapping. At the end of one 3-week unit of study in science, and again at the end of a second 3-week unit, selected measures of science achievement and transfer problem solving ability were administered to all students to evaluate the effects of the different classroom structures on these dependent variables. A measure of attitudes toward the instructional experience was administered once when both 3-week units were completed.    Analyses of variance (ANOVAs) conducted for all content units on pretest scores indicated that the treatment groups were generally equivalent on these variables before treatment began. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) indicated no significant overall effects of treatment or gender, but inspection for effects of gender-by-treatment interaction showed that males performed better than females on Genetics measures of science achievement and transfer problem solving ability, and females performed better than males on an Atomic Structure measure of transfer problem solving.    Concept maps were scored using a concept mapping evaluation procedure established for this study. Comparative analysis revealed that concept maps constructed in cooperative learning groups were less likely to have unconnected concepts or unlabelled propositions. They were less likely to contain errors in content, have concepts out of an acceptable hierarchical order, or lack logical connections. When examined for readability, maps constructed cooperatively were easier to follow than maps constructed individually, suggesting a better overall understanding of unit concepts.

T1  - Community living and psychiatric hospitalization from a consumer/survivor perspective: A causal concept mapping approach
AN  - 304035553
AB  - An innovative methodology was used to derive pictorial maps from the interview data of psychiatrically deinstitutionalized persons to find out: (1) What factors and relationships contribute to community living and hospitalization from the perspective of persons who have been psychiatrically institutionalized two or more times? (2) What is the feasibility and utility of the methodology in building theory and measurement?    First, individual maps were developed to represent the thinking of ten persons. In-depth interviews were coded to identify relevant cause-effect statements. Each individual sorted his or her statements several times into piles of similar ones. The sort piles were coded as a similarity matrix that was the input for multidimensional scaling. The output from the multidimensional scaling was subjected to cluster analysis. Cognitive mapping provided the key causal assertions among the clustered concepts which were added as arrows to the maps. Participants named their clusters and interpreted the causal concept maps. Second, an aggregate map was developed from the individual maps. Five persons sorted the cluster names from the individual maps. The data from the sorts were used as the input for multidimensional scaling followed by cluster analysis. The relationships that individuals had asserted among the concepts were retabulated for these aggregate clusters and shown as arrows on the aggregate map. Both the individual and aggregate maps are useful in building theory and measurement.    The results show that participants actively seek to understand their problems. They learn from their experiences, rejecting strategies that fail replacing them with new ones. Unlike stereotypical views of this population, their thinking is complex and varied. The factors that promote community living include a system of beliefs, money, friendships, hope, self-rehabilitation, a lawsuit, less madness, and opportunities for work and love. The hospitalization experience can range from a "rest cure" to a "chemical straitjacket." It can create, exacerbate, or improve a person's condition although coercive and involuntary treatement severely diminishes the chances of improvement.    The aggregate map captured commonality across the individual maps, showing that the autonomy and stability of individuals living in the community are aided by the realization and strategies of the consumer/survivor, helpful measures of the provider system, and the support and helping tools (e.g., jobs, housing, and self-help/advocacy groups) of the community base. The findings suggest the importance of looking at individual results. Looking only at the aggregate neglects the different paths individuals follow.

AB  - New viewpoints in science education are defining the next generation of science curricula in bold new ways. Research findings in cognitive development establish the need for different pedagogy. Questions about the role of science education in American society force a reexamination of what audience science education does and should serve. As a field, science education itself is evolving from a traditional set of disciplines--biology, chemistry, physics, earth science, to a triadic interface among these disciplines, technology, and societal issues (STS). Three directional elements, constructivism-transmissivism, equity-excellence, and STS-structure of the discipline, constitute framework complete with criteria for analyzing science curriculum materials and a three-dimensional grid, against which examples of the next generation of curricula can be measured. The criteria are applied to $\underline{\rm Chemistry\ in\ the\ Community}$ ($\underline{\rm ChemCom}$), a forerunner of the next generation of science curriculum developed by the American Chemical Society (ACS), to position it on the grid as a written curriculum. Standardized test scores from the ACS-NSTA $\underline{\rm ChemCom}$ exam and the ACS-NSTA High School Chemistry exam, concept maps, essay-based ConnMaps, student interview data and teacher survey data were used to position $\underline{\rm ChemCom}$ on the grid in terms of student learning in the program. Based on the integration of these data, $\underline{\rm ChemCom}$ demonstrates elements of an emerging generation of curricula; specifically it has a strong STS component, a moderate equity element, and a modest constructivist component.

T1  - Conceptual models in the transfer of learning
AN  - 301525665
AB  - In order to attain clinical competence student physiotherapists apply knowledge from a range of cognitive domains in the assessment and treatment of patients with a variety of conditions. Current research indicates that the ability to transfer knowledge to a wide variety of conditions requires a cognitive structure in which concepts are embedded in a rich network of interconnections (Faletti, 1990, Spiro, 1987). A concept mapping technique was selected as means of eliciting a representation of the knowledge the student possessed and would access in order to underpin the assessment and treatment of a specific peripheral joint condition. Twenty second and third year physiotherapy students currently on clinical placement in an Out-Patient Department each produced a concept map prior to assessing the patient. A modification of the 'Student Teacher Dialogue' (Hammond et al, 1989) was the methodology selected for identification of the transfer of learning. Analysis of the transcription of this interaction provided evidence of the domain specific and procedural knowledge transferred to the patient assessment. Weak correlations were found to exist between the degree of complexity of the concept map the student produced and the amount and level of transfer achieved in the clinical setting. Also there was evidence to suggest that abstract subject areas, or those which involved practical or clinical applications, facilitated the development of more concentrated conceptual networks. However, contrary to expectation, third year students failed to produce higher quality maps than second year students, despite having greater academic and clinical experience.

T1  - Individual differences in knowledge representation and problem-solving performance in physics
AN  - 230958599
AB  - Concept mapping in college-level physics was investigated. The study was carried out in three parts. First, an attempt was made to validate concept mapping as a method of evaluating student learning at the junior college level (ages 16-21). Several measures were found to be sensitive to differences in students' achievement. Second, the effectiveness of concept mapping as an instructional strategy was investigated. It was found that the strategy led to improvement in multistep problem-solving performance but not in performance on single step problems. Third, the concept maps made by experts in the field were compared with the maps made by high achieving and average achieving students to see if this is yet another way in which high performance and expertise are related. It was found that the high achieving students made maps which more nearly resembled the maps made by experts than those made by average achieving students.

T1  - Students' alternative conceptions about genetics and the use of teaching strategies for conceptual change
AN  - 219996841
AB  - The purpose of this study was to identify alternative conceptions held by grade 11 (Mathayom 5) Thai students in the area of heredity and to compare the effectiveness of two instructional approaches, identified as the current self-developed teaching approach and the cooperatively-designed teaching approach, in bringing about valid understanding of those alternative conceptions.    115 students enrolled in three upper secondary schools in Khon Kaen, Thailand were periodically administered the written tasks which were composed of concept mapping, general public notions related to heredity, and specific genetic concepts. Also, six selected students from each class were interviewed prior to and following instruction of the heredity unit in order to probe the reasons they gave during the written tasks. Classroom observations, lesson plan reviews, and teachers' dialogic interviews were performed to gather information about classroom implementations.    Thai students were found to possess alternative conceptions similar to ones reported in previous research studies and others that had not been identified.    An analysis of classroom implementation revealed that the teachers who used current self-developed teaching approaches were generally not sensitive to students' alternative conceptions. Whereas, the teacher who used a cooperatively-designed teaching approach was partially successful in implementing conceptual change strategies. Some difficulties in implementing the strategies were observed.    Series of one-way ANOVA's and multiple analysis of variance (MANOVA) were used to analyze the written task scores across five different sessions. It was found that students taught using the cooperatively-designed teaching approach performed better in concept mapping and had better understanding of the concepts related to heredity than students instructed via the teacher's self-developed teaching approach.    It was concluded that the cooperatively-designed teaching approach aimed at correcting students' alternative conceptions was more effective than the current teachers' guide-based approach. The students in a treatment group had fewer alternative conceptions after instruction than the students in other groups. The study suggested a need for curriculum development and application for teacher education and training regarding the constructivist view of learning.

T1  - Problems faced by adolescents, mothers, and stepfathers while learning to live in a remarried family
AN  - 219990079
AB  - The goals of the present research were to identify the problems experienced by mothers, stepfathers, adolescent males, and adolescent females as they learned to live in their "new" remarried families and to determine the themes underlying the problems. Members from twenty remarried families, living in Edmonton, participated in the research.    The problems reported in each of the four groups were displayed on four master lists. Twenty five family therapists then sorted the problems into themes. The results of the 25 theme sorts were then analyzed using Trochim's (1989) Concept Mapping program to yield the higher order themes derived from the therapists' theme sorts.    The findings of this research indicated that mothers, stepfathers, adolescent boys, and adolescent girls, living in Edmonton, all experienced problems. Each group identified different kinds of problems which reflected different conceptual themes. The females problems tended to be more personal and emotion-based than the males whose were more cognitive and practical. The mothers' themes included relationships, belonging and fitting in, sexuality, children's behaviour, time management, and household management. The fathers' themes were role definition, divided loyalties, scheduling, lamentations, and couple relations re: practical matters. The boys' themes included stepfather relations, loyalties, and stepsibling relations. The girls' themes were rivalry, boundaries, alienation, and stepfamily identity.

T1  - Facilitating conceptual understanding in science: A collaborative explanation-based approach
AN  - 304049685
AB  - This thesis evaluates the effects of a Scaffolded Explanation-based approach to collaborative discussion in science. The approach is based on the view that learning science is "problematic": that one must seek to explain, justify, compare and contrast one's personal knowledge with the scientific knowledge that one acquires in order to develop a greater conceptual understanding of scientific phenomena. In so doing, one utilizes one's prior formal knowledge in order to construct more integrated and conceptually advanced explanations which, in turn, allow for a deeper understanding of scientific phenomena. The Scaffolded Explanation-based approach consists of instruction and prompts encouraging students to engage in these processes. The Intervention encourages students to construct mental models by developing explanations, justifying assertions, and comparing their "intuitive" mental model with the formal "scientific" model.    Forty-eight elementary-school aged students identified as having either "intentional" or "nonintentional" approaches to learning based on an Implicit Learning Theory Interview, were divided into three groups (High, Average, and Average Intervention). Students worked both collaboratively and individually on two reasoning tasks, concept maps and explanation problems, in the domain of photosynthesis. The results of the concept mapping tasks indicated that the students in the Average Intervention group developed a more accurate, "scientific", and functional understanding of photosynthesis than the average group who do not receive the Intervention. The study also confirmed the prediction that the Average Intervention group would more closely resemble the High Intentional group by constructing explanations which were conceptually more advanced than those of the Average group who did not receive the Intervention. The Scaffolded Explanation-based Intervention did not have a significant effect on the structure of students' explanations.    This research supports the importance of the nature of students' discussion, i.e., the use of explanation and argumentation, in order to advance students' beliefs about scientific phenomena, as well as emphasizes the usefulness of explanation and conceptual mapping techniques as evaluative measures of students' conceptual change. The theoretical and educational implications for teaching students how to construct and utilize explanations in science classrooms are discussed.

T1  - Resolving students' misconceptions in science: Text in a primary versus a supportive role
AN  - 304043829
AB  - Students' understanding of science concepts and their resolution of misconceptions were examined in this study. The participants were 24 seventh-grade students who were enrolled in two life science classes and were taught two units, Heredity and Ecology, by the science teacher. For one class, designated by chance draw as text supportive, instruction included hands-on activities and reading from various sources. For the text primary class, instruction emphasized the text and was primarily lecture. Assessment of student learning included concept maps with think alouds, concept written picture summaries, an objective content test, and a prior knowledge measure. Significant differences were found between groups on the concept maps, the think aloud explanations, and the written summaries. No significant differences were found for the content tests or prior knowledge measure. More text supportive students resolved their misconceptions than did text primary students. Engagement in hands-on activities and instruction with text in a supportive role aided students' understanding of science concepts.

T1  - The effects of using computer-based formative concept mapping as a learning strategy for high school biology
AN  - 304011261
AB  - This study investigated the effects of using Computer-Based Formative Concept Mapping (CBFCM) on student learning in a high school biology classroom. CBFCM is the process of creating concept maps using graphics software. The process was "formative" because concept maps were modified during instruction to reflect changes in students' understanding over time.    The study was conducted in an urban high school in northwestern USA. Two intact classes of below-average, tenth-grade biology students participated in the study. The students in the experimental class received instruction on computer-based concept mapping and then used CBFCM as a learning strategy for all eight weeks of the intervention. Students in the control class used alternate learning strategies for the first four weeks and then received the same introductory instruction on concept mapping. For the remaining four weeks, instructional procedures for the control group matched those of the experimental group.    Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Quantitative data included scores from: (a) quizzes, (b) concept maps, (c) attitude inventories, and (d) learning style inventories. Qualitative data included information from: (a) questionnaires, (b) interviews, and (c) classroom observations.    The effectiveness of CBFCM was investigated on three levels: (a) as an individual learning strategy, (b) as a group learning strategy, and (c) as an instructional system in the classroom. Major findings are: With respect to student achievement, there were no significant differences between the experimental and control groups' mean scores on teacher-produced quizzes. With respect to student attitude, both groups felt positively toward science throughout the study, however the experimental group exhibited a more negative attitude towards CBFCM, possibly due to frustration over computer difficulties. With respect to student differences, learner characteristics were correlated with the quality of concept maps and trends were found for elaboration skills, spatial skills, GPA, and locus of control. With respect to CBFCM as a learning environment, influential factors were the equipment, the instructional method, and students' prior knowledge of computers and/or concept mapping.    Results are discussed in terms of information processing theory and the requirements for meaningful learning. Suggestions are provided for future research and implementation of CBFCM by teachers.

T1  - The effects of the instruction-modeling-cooperative engagement model on children's print comprehension in science
AN  - 304001515
AB  - This study developed and evaluated the Instruction-Modeling-Cooperative (I-M-C) engagement instructional model. It has two components: (1) explicit verbal instruction and modeling of five comprehension strategies (charting of prior knowledge, prediction, concept mapping, summarization, and question generation) and (2) the cooperative application of these strategies. In this model, the teacher provides theoretical information about the strategy and then models the method for the students, who then work together in cooperative learning groups to apply the technique to content area material.    A prior knowledge test, devised for this experiment, and the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test were administered to 179 fourth and sixth grade students prior to the experiment. The I-M-C students received explicit instruction and modeling in the five comprehension strategies and worked together cooperatively to apply the techniques to the material in their science textbook. Control group students received traditional instruction (lecture, discussion, and completion of workbook/sheet activities). After twelve weeks three posttests, developed for this study, were administered: a cued recall comprehension test, a multiple choice test of science concepts, and a science attitude inventory, as well as the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test.    An experimental-control group design, with pretests and posttests, was used to test the effects of the independent variables (the I-M-C model, age, reading achievement level, and gender) on the dependent measures (reading comprehension, acquisition of science concepts, and attitude toward science). The study included a 2(treatment) x 2(grade) x 4(age) x 3(reading achievement level) x 2(gender) factorial design. Data were analyzed by employing a series of analyses of variance and analyses of covariance, with scores from the Gates-MacGinitie comprehension subtest and the prior knowledge tests as covariates.    Results indicated that the I-M-C model was beneficial for enhancing comprehension, as measured by the cued recall test, acquisition of concepts, and attitude toward learning. It was not effective in improving comprehension as measured by the comprehension subtest of the Gates-MacGinitie Reading Test. The findings suggested that the I-M-C model is effective at promoting comprehension of science material, the acquisition of science concepts, and a positive attitude toward science.

T1  - An analysis of concept mapping as an instructional technique for teaching advanced technology concepts to at-risk junior high school students
AN  - 303993153
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of concept mapping as an instructional technique for teaching advanced technology concepts to at-risk junior high school students. The students were from three Northern Illinois school districts, 174 students from three junior high schools. The study sought to assess the effects on achievement of students who used concept mapping as part of a carefully designed sequence of instructions.    Method and procedure. Eight intact junior high school technology classes, taught by three instructors, took part in this study. Of the 174 seventh and eighth grade students participating in this study, 87 students were in the treatment groups, and 87 students were in the control groups. The intact groups were formed from two schools with three classes and one school with two classes. Within each school, classes were randomly assigned to be the treatment groups or control groups. The criteria for student selection for the at-risk group were based on (a) students' attendance, (b) students' behavior, (c) personal history, (d) counselor's input, and (e) parent conferences. The at-risk students were identified by a code only known by classroom teachers. The quasi-experimental design used for this study was the pretest-posttest design. A two-way ANCOVA using the pretest scores as a covariate analyzed the posttest scores to determine what effect, if any, distinguished between the instructional methods.    Results. There was one main finding of this study. The benefits of using concept mapping appeared for the at-risk students than for the not-at-risk students.    Conclusion. For this junior high school at-risk population, concept mapping during and after instruction led to greater achievement as measured by posttest.

T1  - Use of concept maps in microcomputer-based program design for an AIDS knowledge base
AN  - 303992865
AB  - This research evaluated the effectiveness of concept maps for representation and organization of a knowledge base about Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS). The knowledge was represented within a micro-computer based program. Domain experts developed a concept map representing the major concepts of subordinate knowledge about AIDS. Two computer programs were subsequently developed, using different ways to graphically represent the knowledge base about AIDS. One program used a graphic display of the concept map to guide the learner in using the program, the other used a traditional linear format.    The research occurred in two phases. First, interviews were conducted with a convenience sample of fourteen nursing student volunteers for the purpose of determining student perceptions and concerns as they used the concept map program. These interviews revealed positive student perceptions concerning the use of concept maps. A need for the program to contain some sort of tracking system for the user's progression through the program was identified.    The experimental phase of the study used a repeated-measures factorial design. Knowledge about AIDS was assessed at pretest, immediate post-test, and delayed post-test. Eighty-four student volunteers were randomly assigned by computer to either the concept map or linear format program. Forty-nine students returned to take the delayed post-test from two to six weeks after completing the immediate post-test.    The results of paired t-tests indicated a significant effect of treatment on both groups. That is, students using both the concept map and linear format programs showed gains in knowledge about AIDS from pretest to immediate post-test. There was a significant main effect of time-on-task on post-test performance. Even after partialing out the effect of pretest performance and time-on-task, differences between treatment groups accounted for virtually none of the gain in knowledge experienced by participants in this study. Item analysis included the use of two subscales, depending on whether the knowledge being assessed by the item was explicitly or implicitly addressed in the SmartBook. Although the use of concept maps has been considered to promote inductive learning, similar gains were seen for each item type. Interpretation of these findings should include the following considerations: (a) students using the concept map SmartBook were exposed to a unique way of presenting information within a micro-computer based program for which they had no special preparation; and (b) since the linear format SmartBook was created from the concept map SmartBook, differences between programs may have been too small to measure with the instrument used in this study.

T1  - Concept mapping/cooperative learning as a technique to improve the learning of "at-risk" and nondisabled students
AN  - 303992513
AB  - This study systematically assessed the effects of concept mapping in a cooperative learning environment on achievement and attitudes of biology students.    During the study, the students were asked to identify and draw charts connecting independent concepts found in the lessons taught. The concept maps thus produced were collected and evaluated to find out their ability to identify concept/s and also their ability to link those concepts meaningfully. They were also given a written test on the subject taught at the end of each week in order to determine the utility of such a technique in improving classroom achievement of "at-risk" and nondisabled students. The study was carried out over a five week period. A total of forty-two tenth grade students responded to the test measures for the dependent variables on achievement, and attitude toward concept mapping and cooperative learning. The results showed a positive effect on classroom achievement. The results also revealed that that the students attitude towards concept mapping and cooperative learning were positive.

T1  - The effects of spacing a science unit on sound on the conceptual understanding of eighth-grade students as evaluated through concept maps
AN  - 303991276
AB  - In 1989, the National Science Teachers Association proposed a new "Scope, Sequence, and Coordination (SS & C)" for grade 7-12 science. Instead of studying science in one-year packages of physics, chemistry, biology, and earth/space science, proponents of SS & C proposed that students study each of these disciplines every year. The idea that students can learn and retain new material better if they study it in spaced intervals rather than all at once provided the focus for this study.    There is a base of psychological research demonstrating the positive effects of "spaced" practice on recall and recognition, but few of these situations parallel the type of instruction that occurs in the science classroom. The research study which follows compares the effects on conceptual understanding of eighth graders when a three-week sound unit was spaced as opposed to the same material presented all at once to the control group.    Eighth grade students were randomly assigned to an experimental or control group. The experimental group experienced a three-week sound unit in distinct one-week packages each separated by a week of unrelated material. In the control group, the sound unit was experienced as an intact three-week unit. All activities on an individual concept were presented together.    Students were asked to construct concept maps after each week of study in both the experimental and control groups. These maps were used to evaluate levels of students' conceptual understanding. The quality of each concept map was assessed by weighting each valid proposition according to an acquisition level (1-4) and summing these numbers to obtain a weighted total. The total number of valid propositions and the weighted total for each group were compared using a standard t-test. Although there were no significant differences between the concept maps of the control and experimental group, students in the spaced group reported favorable attitudes towards the spaced curriculum.

T1  - Changed teaching method affects outcome: Ecology and a stream
AN  - 303985112
AB  - Students often fail to learn Science with understanding. Either they misunderstand their teacher and text book, or they just memorize enough facts and definitions to get by (Berkheimer, 1990). Changing the method of instruction in an Advanced Biology class should produce improved understanding. The general topic is ecology as studied through the described activities relating to the water quality of Huntoon Creek. By using concept mapping, pre and post testing, multiple activities (creative ecological collage, computer simulations, classroom aquatic ecosystems, lab practice techniques, on-site water quality stream analysis and a culminating booklet of the study by the student, clinical interviews and revised lesson plans), there was a measurable increase in knowledge and understanding of ecology and water quality. This is shown with test data from the previous four years, pre and post testing and clinical interview results. Experiencing the real world and its problems through field trips (hydroelectric power plant, fish weir and waste water treatment plant) helped connect book knowledge to personal experience.

T1  - The role of ambiguity tolerance in the learning of science concepts by junior high school science students who are presented discrepant event science demonstrations
AN  - 303985099
AB  - Only when the misconceptions that are strongly held by individuals become supplanted by more powerful conceptions will functional improvements be realized in science understanding. Current research identifies a plethora of the most common of these misconceptions. Some have proposed concept mapping as an educational tool to represent more appropriate cognitive interrelationships. Others have suggested the use of a critical event to "corner" the student into conceptual remodeling. These methods may have some efficacy, but little has been accomplished to elucidate the role of individual differences in the alteration of these dysfunctional schema.    This research was designed to probe the role of the ambiguity intolerance in the learning of 116 junior high students in response to two videotaped discrepant event science demonstrations. Ambiguity intolerance was assessed with two differently modified forms of the MAT-50. The demonstrations involved water/air pressure and magnetic flux. Characteristics of gender, grade level, nonverbal abstract reasoning, and Piagetian figural reasoning were also included in the analysis. Cognitive behaviors of the Ss were evaluated using written predictions, responses by Ss during their observation of the discrepant events, and immediate/delayed prose recalls. The written passages were analyzed for correctness of recall and explanation, and also for information characteristics using the matrix calculations of Modern Information Theory developed by Moser. The data were analyzed to determine significant differences, relations, multiple regression models, and discriminant models using the BMDP statistical software package.    The ambiguity instruments provided measures that significantly categorized "tolerant" and "intolerant" Ss and that were significantly related to the responding and cognition of Ss who had experienced discrepant phenomena. Measures of responding and recall by Ss significantly explained the variance in the ambiguity intolerance of gender and grade level groups of Ss and significantly discriminated those groups. Ambiguity intolerance was found important to the assessment of young adolescents' ability to cognitively process discrepant science phenomena, and thereby replace scientific misconceptions.

T1  - Examining water play from a constructivist perspective
AN  - 303984734
AB  - The purpose of this inquiry was to examine children's water play. Using a constructivist theory of learning, this research sought to provide insight into how children construct knowledge and make sense of their experience during spontaneous play.    Literature was reviewed that supports the position that (1) Children learn through play, (2) Water is a valuable play medium, and (3) Children construct knowledge.    The researcher identified six recurring methods the children used to construct knowledge and make sense of their water play experience. These were: Explore and Converse, Role Play, Inquire and Investigate, Explain, Connect & Link, and Interact With Others.    An analysis revealed the following three themes. The children were: (1) Following Their Own Interests, (2) Conducting Experiments, and (3) Were Working Autonomously and Cooperatively.    Four detailed concept maps were developed to illustrate the following: (1) Opportunities For Knowledge Development In Water Play, (2) Methods Children Used To Construct Knowledge, (3) Teacher's Influence On Children's Sense-Making, and (4) A Summary Of The Water Play Curriculum.    The challenges of implementing a curriculum based on the theory of constructivism are identified. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - Educating in a biology classroom: A coherent approach to teaching, curriculum, learning, and governance
AN  - 303967840
AB  - The focus of this research were two sections of a freshman-level Biological Science course at Morgan State University during the spring semester of 1987. A descriptive case study approach was used in examining the commonplaces of curriculum, teaching, learning, and governance in this classroom environment. Vee analysis, concept-mapping and interviews along with numerous other techniques were used in order to create an environment for learning to occur; that is the integration of thinking, feeling, and acting relative to the biology subject-matter and to learning in general, by the students in the study.    The research was planned, conducted and interpreted based on Gowin's Theory of Educating, Novak's Theory of Meaningful Concept Learning and the Ausubel/Novak Theory of Cognitive Assimilation Learning.    Plans for educative events were first made by the researcher using Vee analysis. This phase involved the selection and logical arrangement of curriculum materials based on the theories.    The major claims of this study were (1) that the teacher could use Vee analysis and currently viable theories of education to select and logically arrange curriculum materials for a college biology course in order to facilitate teaching, learning and governance; (2) that some basic biology concepts for the course could be identified through the Vee analysis of the discipline process; (3) that there were two techniques, Vee analysis and concept-mapping that could be used routinely by students to help them learn biology concepts; and (4) that through the use of these techniques and others, students could gain insights into their own learning and self-governance.    Students were able to understand and routinely use concept-mapping. They were less confortable with Vee analysis for laboratory. The teacher found Vee analysis, however, to be an invaluable technique for analyzing the structure of the biology discipline.    Learning questionnaires and personal interviews were excellent as metalearning devices. The descriptive case study approach gave the college teacher a very effective way of examining in detail what she actually did daily in the context of "educating." The teacher became a researcher and in the process made the entire process more pleasurable and effective for students.

T1  - The juggling act: An ethnographic analysis of clinical teaching in nursing education
AN  - 304020877
AB  - It is generally accepted that a practice experience is a crucial aspect of education for the professions. However, little research has been directed toward the basic analysis of clinical teaching behaviour. Much of what has been published in regard to clinical teaching is based on the authors' assumptions about the components of a clinical teacher's role. There has been a paucity of effort to identify these components within a specific conceptual framework. Consequently, clinical teachers in the professions have tended to teach as they were taught and the character of clinical education has remained relatively stagnant throughout the past few decades. His exploratory and descriptive qualitative research study was designed in order to develop a conceptual framework for understanding and explaining what takes place in the realm of clinical teaching in nursing education. The theory of symbolic interaction provided the theoretic orientation for the exploring the meaning and behaviour of six nursing educators in regard to clinical teaching. The research methods employed in the research study were selected in order to identify how the subjects explain reality in their own terms. An ethnographic epistemology, based on the social psychology framework of symbolic interaction, was utilized as a strategy for discovering the contextual reality of the clinical teachers' behaviour. The participants in the study were six clinical teachers in three schools of nursing; two diploma schools and one university generic baccalaureate program. Each of the participants in the study taught on medical-surgical wards in an urban hospital. The research entailed more than 1200 hours of participant observation, as well as interviewing, document analysis and concept mapping. Four major categories of teacher perspectives (i.e., values and beliefs) concerning clinical teaching were identified. A descriptive model of clinical teaching in Nursing Education emerged from the data by means of the constant comparative of data analysis. The Crystallization Model of Clinical teaching in Nursing Education portrays clinical teaching as a dynamic, interactional process in which what the teacher intends is mediated by a variety of contextual and mediating variables. Many of these variables are beyond the teacher's control. Consequently, the research participants generally viewed clinical teaching as a random activity which prohibited the planning for and the anticipation of specific learning events/situations. The essence of clinical teaching is identified in this model as the transmission of the practice of the profession; the presentation of a model of and for reality to students. The implications of the Crystallization Model in relation to curriculum reform, teacher preparation and future research are discussed in the research report.

T1  - Concept-mapping and chemistry achievement, integrated science process skills, logical thinking abilities, and gender at teachers colleges in Taiwan
AN  - 303995206
AB  - This study was designed to determine the effectiveness of the concept-mapping technique on chemistry achievement by teachers college students. Relationships among gender, integrated science process skills, logical thinking abilities, and student achievement were also studied. The study was conducted during the fall semester of 1990 at two teachers colleges in Taipei, Taiwan. Four intact non-science major classes took part in this study. Two weeks prior to the study, experimental groups learned the concept mapping technique for 1 hour 40 minutes. In the next class period, a pretest was administered to groups E1 and C1. The test covered the content that would be taught during the upcoming four weeks.    During this four weeks, all students received regular course instruction. Fifteen minutes before the end of each class period, the students received a list of concepts covered during the class period. Only groups E1 and E2 were asked to map these concepts. Groups C1 and C2 were asked to define these concepts. Concept maps and definitions were completed and turned in to the researcher at the end of the period and were then graded and returned to students Skills (TIPS II) and the Group Assessment of Logical Thinking Abilities (GALT) were also administered during this period to all groups at available times. After four weeks, posttests which contained the same questions as the pretests were administered to all students.    Based on the data analysis using ANOVA via MRC, there was no difference in chemistry achievement between students who completed concept maps and students who completed concept definitions. However, there was a significant interaction between treatment condition and TIPS II scores; students with lower TIPS II scores did better in the treatment.    In the treatment groups, there were no gender differences on the posttest; however, there was a significant gender difference in the control group. Similarly, there was a gender difference in TIPS II scores but no gender difference in GALT scores in the whole sample. The gender differences on the chemistry posttest and the TIPS II scores in the control group was likely due to the different standards for entering the teachers colleges. The relationships between TIPS II scores and GALT scores were significant. There was also a significant prediction of chemistry achievement by TIPS II scores and GALT scores.    The researcher concludes that the concept mapping technique is an alternative learning method that may be appropriate for those lower achieving students. For a future study, it is recommended that a longer period of time for teaching the technique is necessary.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping on learning approach and meaningful learning
AN  - 303986495
AB  - Two hundred and nine undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory Anthropology course were pre-tested using the Learning and Study Strategy Inventories (LASSI) to establish their learning approach. Concept mapping was used to alter a student's learning approach from a non-creative to a creative approach. Students were then post-tested using the LASSI to evaluate the learning intervention. The first hypothesis proposed that non-creative learners would become more holistic and creative learners as a result of the concept mapping intervention. No significant treatment effects were found. Non-creative learners made significant gains in concentration from pre to post testing. It was also hypothesized that certain demographic variables would help explain the learning approach a student demonstrated. Science students had the highest mean attitude, motivation, concentration and time management and use of test strategies. Anthropology students had the highest anxiety, and arts students increased on information processing. Nineteen year olds were the most motivated and attitude decreased with age. Second year students who had taken a previous course in anthropology had higher mean attitudes, motivation, concentration, selecting main ideas, and use of test strategies when compared to second year students who hadn't taken a previous course. Science students increased their mean use of test strategies regardless of previous course work. Overall, the mean use of test strategies increased regardless of faculty affiliation had a student taken a previous course. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - The effect of concept mapping on biology achievement of field-dependent students
AN  - 303975094
AB  - Statement of the problem. The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of using concept mapping on biology achievement of field dependent students. A secondary purpose was to determine movement toward field independence occurring as a result of field dependent students using concept mapping.    Methods. The study investigated gains in achievement and field independence by field dependent subjects using concept mapping during their study of biology. Random assignment to treatment or control conditions was made. Treatment consisted of learning concept mapping skills, and then using these skills as a study aid in biology. Treatment groups utilized concept mapping during two consecutive units. Control groups studied only the second unit under treatment conditions. Pretest-posttest gains of field dependent subjects who demonstrated concept mapping competence were compared. Field dependence/independence was assessed using the Group Embedded Figures Test (GEFT) before the experimental period, and at the conclusion of each unit.    Results. Analyses indicated that no statistically significant pretest-posttest gain difference existed between field-dependent subjects in treatment and control groups for the first or second unit. However, mean unit posttest scores of treatment field dependent subjects were higher than those in control groups. In addition, pretest-posttest gain score comparisons between field dependent subjects in treatment groups and field independent subjects were not significantly different. No statistically significant difference existed across GEFT scores between field dependent subjects in treatment and control groups. However, a possible test-retest effect was observed.    Conclusions. Trends observed in mean unit posttest scores and the test of "no significant difference" between pretest-posttest gains of field dependent subjects in treatment groups and all field independent subjects support the assertion that concept mapping may help field dependent students in biology. Additional research which includes longer concept mapping training for field dependent students may verify these trends. Considerations of sample size, treatment duration, and teacher familiarity with concept mapping should be addressed. Detection of movement toward field independence was not possible, due, in part, to short intervals between tests. Research on mobility associated with concept mapping use which involves longer time periods and accounts for any GEFT test-retest effect is suggested.

T1  - A comparison of a storyline-based method of instruction and a textbook method of instruction on the acquisition of science concepts in the elementary school
AN  - 303960810
AB  - This study sought to determine the effectiveness of a holistic, literature based approach versus the traditional textbook method of instruction on the acquisition of science concepts in the third grade. The holistic, literature based classes (114 students) served as the experimental group; the traditional text-based classes (84 students) were the control group.    Both groups studied the topic of simple machines and motion. All students were instructed in the use of concept mapping and drew a concept map on the topic of machines. This served as a predictor variable. Two methods of instruction were initiated. At the conclusion of the instructional period, both groups took a commercially prepared unit test and drew a second concept map on the topic of machines.    Multiple regression was used to analyze the data. Predictor variables included: instructional time, gender, student IQ, pre-treatment concept map score, teacher's score on the DeFord "Theoretical Orientation to Reading Profile" score, and treatment group. Dependent variables were the post-treatment concept map score and the unit exam score.    No significant differences were found between the experimental and control groups for the post-treatment concept map score or unit exam score. The girls in both groups scored significantly higher than the boys on unit test scores, but there was no difference on concept map scores.    IQ was a significant predictor for both the post-treatment concept map and unit test scores for the entire population. Time was significant for the unit test scores for the entire population.    The DeFord scores indicated that experimental and control group teachers both represented scores indicative of "skills" level instruction. To become effective with whole language approaches, teachers would need considerable opportunity to learn and implement holistic principles and procedures.    Students in a holistic literature-based program performed equally with students in a textbook-based program. Therefore, it was concluded that the holistic literature-based program is a viable alternative to the textbook-based program insofar as concept mapping and text measured achievement were concerned.

T1  - Change in the cognitive structure of community college students as the result of a laboratory experience
AN  - 303957077
AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the effect that a laboratory experience has on the cognitive structure of community college biology students. The effect of the biology laboratory was measured by comparing the students' pretest and posttest concept maps with the concept maps of experts after a biology laboratory experience. The concept maps were generated by Multiscale II, a multidimensional scaling program.    This study consists of three substudies: (a) an enzyme laboratory substudy, which used an experimental format, (b) a plant life cycle laboratory substudy, which was a verification laboratory, and (c) a flower and fruit laboratory substudy, which was a dissection laboratory.    The enzyme substudy provides strong evidence that the laboratory treatment was effective in changing the conceptual framework of the experimental group toward that of the experts. The plant life cycle substudy did not produce conclusive results in support of a positive effect of the laboratory treatment. The flower and fruit substudy produced results that are difficult to interpret because random selection of the students was unable to produce equal experimental and control groups. The absence of a follow-up session in the plant life cycle substudy has not been eliminated as a possible cause of the lack of significant change.    This study fully supports the contention that MDS generated concept maps can be useful in demonstrating that conceptual change can be produced by a laboratory experience. These same MDS-generated concept maps were useful in identifying misconceptions and provide the necessary information needed to change laboratory instructional strategies to correct the misconception. The Multiscale-generated concept maps produced in this study seem to be plausible depictions of the interrelationships among the concepts which students hold, since the clustering of the concept points on the graph reflected actual clustering of ideas.    Further studies should focus on other types of experimental laboratories. More studies are needed on biology laboratories that emphasize complex anatomical dissections and require formative discussion at the end of the laboratory procedures.

T1  - Adventure-based professional development: A theory-focused evaluation
AN  - 303955881
AB  - This evaluation of the adventure-based professional development program offered second-year MBA students in the Cornell business school is focused upon program theory, including theories-of-action and theories-in-use underlying the program. The six-day adventure was supported by the business school as a means to enhance students' communication, team-building, leadership and problem-solving skills. Theories-in-use of the outdoor trainers were identified and matches were made between those theoretical patterns and the participating MBAs' experiences on the outdoor courses.    The study design was an interpretive case study. Qualitative methods--participant observation, interviewing and journal analysis--were used to collect data during and two months after the program. Concept mapping, a structured conceptualization technique, was also used to help identify the theoretical underpinnings of the outdoor program. Pattern-matching, where patterns in the program-as-intended are matched with the program-as-experienced, was a methodological innovation used in the research.    Specific theories-in-use articulated were those dealing with the motivation of business students to participate in the program, the amount of adversity and physical hardship that students felt appropriate for this type of programming and the metaphors between the outdoor course and the business world. It was found that MBAs enrolled in the course to complement their business studies with hands-on leadership experience. The course was not perceived as an immediate metaphor for the business world according to most MBAs. However, participants claimed significant gains in group bonding and trust, feedback on personal leadership styles, and understanding of group processes, including decision-making and communication. Concerning the issue of adversity, program groups which experienced sleep and information deprivation found such conditions to be distracting and, in several cases, annoying and frustrating.    The literature review identifies the philosophical and educational underpinnings of adventure-based training. The role of theory in evaluation is also traced. A role of theory endorsed in this study is that of assisting practitioners. Evaluations which explicate practitioners' theories-of-action and theories-in-use serve as tools for theoretical refinement and program improvement.

T1  - Effects of post-questioning, concept mapping and feedback on cognitive performance in distance education
AN  - 303954445
AB  - This study examined the effects of post-questioning, concept mapping and feedback on cognitive performance in a twenty week, undergraduate nursing distance education course. Post-questioning without feedback was the control condition, and both strategies were presented in a combined format. The dependent measures included achievement scores of subjects on multiple choice and essay-type questions in the midterm and final course examinations and subjects' attitudes towards various methods of studying.    The omnibus MANCOVA performed on achievement data produced a significant main effect for the independent variables on the set of DVs. In the univariate analysis, with $\alpha$ set at.05, treatment group differences were observed on six of the ten DVs in the design. In the stepdown analysis, with a more conservative $\alpha$ set at.005, only one of these six variables was significant. This was recall of key idea units on essay questions in the final examination that were cued to content with mapping exercises.    The omnibus MANOVA carried out on attitudinal data produced a significant main effect for the factor variables. Significant group difference was observed on only one of the factors which revealed a preference for visual and graphical learning aids. The source of this difference was between the low and high persistence concept mappers. According to the direction of means, low mappers (i.e., subjects who completed an average of 3 out of 12 sets of mapping exercises) held a negative attitude towards visual and graphic learning aids, while high mappers (i.e., those who completed an average of 11 out of 12 sets of mapping exercises) were more positively disposed towards them.    ANOVA tests were carried out on subjects' responses to questions on concept mapping and post-questioning strategies. Significant differences were found between the high and low persistence mappers on several issues concerning mapping. In comparison with high persistence mappers, the low persistence mappers found concept mapping exercises more difficult, more time-consuming and less useful as a method of studying. No significant differences were observed for post-questioning strategy with regard to difficulty level, usefulness or time taken to do them.

T1  - The systematic representation of knowledge and problem-solving in the social sciences
AN  - 303954309
AB  - This paper provides a rationale for the development of a computerized problem solving environment based on an information processing model of problem solving in the social sciences. Two problem solving presentation environments were developed. One environment included a concept map which graphically represents the interconnections between concepts in a data base on tropical deforestation. A second environment provided an alphabetical index to the same data. Both environments included a hypertext system for accessing data.    The first goal of the thesis was to examine the contribution of prior knowledge, reading comprehension, data presentation, and data selection on the recall of domain related information presented during problem solving. The second goal was to examine the contribution of the same variables on problem solving in the social sciences.    Since most social science problems lack an agreed upon answer, a special emphasis was placed on a subject's justification of a solution. Therefore, protocols of subject's solutions were recorded and analyzed for the goal and reasoning structures employed in the justification of a problem solution.    In the first analysis, effects of prior knowledge, reading comprehension, and data presentation, were examined to determine their contribution to recall of literal domain related information presented in the database. Immediately following the protocol collection the subjects completed a multiple choice recall test. The results indicated that prior knowledge and reading ability were strong predictors of domain knowledge recall. Type of presentation was not significant as a predictor of domain knowledge recall.    In the second analysis the effects of prior knowledge, reading comprehension, data presentation, and data selection were examined to determine their contribution to social science problem solving. A group of college level subjects were presented with an open ended social science problem dealing with development in a tropical rainforest. They were then provided with twenty minutes to select and examine data stored in a computer program. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a concept map presentation of data or an alphabetical listing of data. At the conclusion of the data search activity the subjects provided a verbal response which was recorded with a tape recorder and subjected to a protocol analysis of the goal and reasoning structures employed in justifying a solution. Results indicated that only the variable of prior knowledge was a significant as a predictor of problem solving ability across all subjects. Further analysis of the performance of low knowledge individuals indicated that presentation type improved one's ability to predict problem solving performance.    Additional comments concerning the nature of problem solving differences based on common features of subject protocols was included in a discussion of problem solving performance.

T1  - An investigation of the science content preparation of Iowa State University elementary education majors: Relationships among secondary and college course backgrounds, attitude toward teaching science, science teaching efficacy, science misconceptions, and science achievement
AN  - 303953051
AB  - The goal of this study was to explore the role that formal science content education plays in the process of educating future elementary teachers of science. The formal science content preparation of elementary education majors was investigated to explore the relationships between secondary school and college science content preparation and science achievement, attitude toward teaching science, science teaching efficacy, selected science misconceptions, and other demographic variables. Some of the instruments utilized included Enoch's and Rigg's Science Teaching Efficacy Belief Instrument Form B, Thompson's and Shrigley's Revised Science Attitude Scale, the ACT Science Reasoning Test, student constructed concept maps, and a demographics questionnaire.    Although a number of statistically significant relationships were found to exist among the variables, the significant correlations were mainly in what might be classified as low to moderate ranges of correlation.    The results of this research can be drawn upon to make recommendations and set strategies for policy makers to consider when determining how to best prepare elementary education majors to teach science.

T1  - An experiment testing the effects of concept mapping on science anxiety and acquisition of scientific knowledge among eighth-grade students low in integrative complexity
AN  - 303946458
AB  - A 2 x 2 factorial design was used to study the effects of concept mapping on science anxiety and science achievement for 145 eighth-grade males and females low in integrative complexity. Anxiety was measured using the Czerniak Assessment of Science Anxiety (CASA); achievement was measured by an experimenter-developed instrument, the Powers of 10 test (P10); and integrative complexity was measured by the Paragraph Completion Test (PCT). A multivariate analysis found that concept mapping makes a significant difference in science achievement but not science anxiety. This finding is limited by two confounding variables that favored the concept mapping group: time on task and treatment-by-instrumentation interaction. Other findings include a significantly higher level of anxiety for females in the concept mapping group than females in the neutral group, except for laboratory-related activities where the reverse was true. The conclusions of the study were that concept mapping as implemented did not have any significant effect on anxiety, but did have some effect on science achievement. It was also concluded that content more in line with the current science curriculum and additional treatment time may be key to achieving significant results with concept mapping.

T1  - Learning in the middle school earth science classroom: Students conceptually integrate new knowledge using intelligent laserdiscs
AN  - 303946090
AB  - The purpose of this investigation was to describe the ways in which middle school students learn as they used an intelligent laservideodisc to create interactive multimedia projects about "weather." Specifically, the relationship was described between the cognitive learning variables, developmental readiness and students' cognitive structure, and the instructional materials students used. GALT, Locus of Control, and Concept Maps were used to assess students' readiness and cognitive structure. Fourteen small groups (3-4 students) of eighth grade earth science students worked at the "authoring" level in HyperCard and with the laservideodisc to complete informative interactive "stacks" for their classmates. Each group worked for ten instructional periods over five weeks to research, interpret and create original links between textual and visual information. Audio tapes and continuously "saved" computer records from each workstation were used in describing the group authoring process and student learning.    Groups worked interdependently, with division of labor, or as associations of individuals, to accomplish the task of producing a weather project. Elements of the groups' final projects reflect the various strategies of group work. Projects could not be differentiated based on GALT, Locus of Control, or prior knowledge map scores. All groups successfully created interactive laservideodisc project stacks incorporating original text, drawings, video images, "buttons," and "cut and paste" resources.    Results indicate that direct student use of laservideodisc in the middle school classroom extends students' possible learning experiences, motivates students to stay on task, and can be effectively used by students for meaningful learning. This "hands on" model for introducing students to new content, new technology, and metacognitive strategies promotes cooperative learning and motivation for science learning. By enabling researchers to unobtrusively record students' daily progress, interactions, and decision-making, his new interactive technology is a particularly powerful tool for learning research. ftn*"Intelligent Laserdiscs" is a term used to specify laservideodisc players linked to and controlled through a computer. This term implies "Level III" use of the laservideodisc.

T1  - A concept learning and teaching approach to the instruction of linear motion in introductory college physics
AN  - 303935981
AB  - In the instruction of introductory college physics, many students use concepts that are unaccepted by scientists to interpret the phenomena of linear motion and motion graphs. In fact, these students possess a set of misconceptions for explaining linear motion before the physics teaching. Thus there is a need to (1) develop an instructional design, in accordance with a physics concept teaching model derived from learning theories and teaching models, that is related to the motion topic in introductory physics for college level students, (2) test whether the design can improve students' concept learning about motion, and (3) learn if it can be used as an instructional system for introductory college physics.    The physics concept teaching method design is based on Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning and then combined with Novak's concept map instructional strategy, Tennyson and Cocchiarella's concept-teaching model, and Berlin and White's general instructional model.    Three groups of non-science students studying introductory college physics 101 are randomly assigned to a traditional teaching method, an example-nonexample teaching method, and the concept teaching method. There are four instruments in this study: (1) physics concept map pre- and post-test used to test students learning of physics concepts, (2) physics misconception pre- and post-test used to test students' physics misconceptions, (3) physics achievement test, and (4) physics learning attitude test.    The results of this study show that the concept teaching method effectively improves students' cognitive structure and that the students' misconception attitude is correlated with their misconception test. Moreover, all three groups have positive attitudes toward learning physics concepts, but negative attitudes toward using the concept map.    Therefore, the concept teaching method is worthwhile as a method of physics instruction, when a sufficient number of lecture sessions are offered to teach motion concepts and concept map.

T1  - Case study of a sixth-grade class using Marine Science Project: FOR SEA
AN  - 303914583
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate students' academic achievement and attitude towards the marine environment before, during, and after the Marine Science Project: FOR SEA experience. This case study was conducted with 19 students and their teacher in a sixth grade honors science class in a private school located in Atlanta, Georgia. The students experienced a 22 day unit regarding physical and biological aspects of the marine environment.    Students' knowledge about the marine environment before and after their FOR SEA experience was measured by a pretest/posttest and "brain storming" (concept) maps. The students' attitudes toward the marine environment before and after their FOR SEA experience were measured by open-ended questionnaires, "brain storming" maps, interviews, and student journals. The students' attitudes towards the marine environment during FOR SEA were monitored by student journals, participant observation, and informal and formal interviews.    There is significant positive gain in students' knowledge of the marine environment as a result of FOR SEA. After experiencing FOR SEA, students were less likely to consider lakes, rivers, ponds, or swamps as concepts of the marine environment. Students' attitudes during the FOR SEA experience changed significantly toward the subject of pollution. Initially their interest centered around recreational activities, whereas at the unit's conclusion they emphasized concern for the damaged marine environment and its resources. Finally, the FOR SEA experience positively enhanced and/or changed students' prior attitude toward marine concepts. In some students, preconceived fears were replaced with interest in and desire to learn more about the marine environment.

T1  - The Effects of Enriching Two Main Instructional Strategies with Concept Mapping and Problem-Solving on Senior Secondary School Students' Cognition in Chemistry
AN  - 2672759322
AB  - This study investigated the effect of enriching two main instructional methods, guided-discovery and lecture methods with concept mapping and problem-solving on students’ cognition in chemistry. A sample of 218 randomly selected secondary school chemistry students were pre-tested to assess their prior knowledge, grouped into four instructional groups (concept mapping and problem-solving in guided, discovery mode (CPG); concept mapping and problem-solving in lecture mode (CPL); guided-discovery, (GD); and lecture (LM) groups taught for eight weeks and post-tested on the topics electrolysis, acid-base reactions and energetics.Five research instruments were used pre-and post instructions to test six hypotheses: Group Embedded Figure Test, (GEFT), the Pre-Achievement Test (PAT); the Students’ Attitudinal Test (SAT); the Piagetian Chemical Combination Task (PCCT); a Chemistry Achievement Test (CAT) and a retention test, 2 weeks after treatment to gather data. The pre-test consisted of items on prerequisites to the topics taught in this study.

T1  - The effects of self-esteem training on practicing registered nurses
AN  - 303926858
AB  - Nursing staff shortages and the high cost of health care have focused attention on burnout in nurses. High self-esteem is seen as a buffer to prevent burnout and is thought to enhance performance. The purpose of this study is to observe the effects of self-esteem training on practicing registered nurses and to explored the relationship between self-esteem and performance.    Concept mapping was used as the teaching strategy. The majority (86%) of the randomly selected sample had both high self-esteem and high quality performance before training. After training 92% had normal healthy levels of self-esteem and performance levels increased significantly. No relationship was found between self-esteem and performance. Findings revealed that 38% of the random sample were experiencing emotional distress regardless of their levels of self-esteem.    This study adds to the growing evidence that practicing registered nurses have high self-esteem. It suggests that burnout in practicing registered nurses is the result of conflict, not low self-esteem. (Abstract shortened by UMI.)

T1  - The reliability, sensitivity, and criterion-related validity of concept comparisons and concept maps for assessing reading comprehension
AN  - 303892574
AB  - Most current reading assessment methods do not reflect the reading comprehension construct which has emerged from information processing research. Current methods rarely account for differences in relevant background knowledge or schema held by students prior to reading, and are insensitive to the structural nature of text information and student knowledge. This study investigated the reliability and concurrent, criterion-related validity of concept comparison (CC) ratings and computer-derived multidimensional scaling (MDS) maps for reading comprehension assessment. Reliability was assayed by comparing CC ratings and maps produced independently by five teachers while they read eight 250-word passages from science and social studies texts. For three of the eight passages, sufficient interrater reliability was obtained. For the three reliable passages only, two methods were applied to assay test validity with 104 reading disabled Junior and Senior High School students. First, a randomized control group design was used to compare CC tasks completed before and after students had read related or unrelated text passages. Students reading the related passages produced post-reading CC scores significantly more closely related to expert teacher scores than did readers of unrelated passages. Second, student and expert CC score similarities were correlated with student scores on two classes of external measures: (a) extant vocabulary and reading comprehension scores from published, norm-referenced reading tests, and (b) maze tests, multiple choice questions, and oral reading fluency performance--all based on the reading passages. The three passage-based measures were substantially related to Post-reading CC scores, but not to Pre-reading CC scores. Standardized test scores were not significantly related to either Pre- or Post-reading CC scores. The reliability and validity results were interpreted as supporting the continued use of concept comparison tasks and derived MDS maps in research for assessing reading comprehension with Junior and Senior High School disabled readers.

T1  - Adult gender differences in epistemology and knowledge about fat and cholesterol
AN  - 303891980
AB  - Nutrition education researchers seek to better understand the process of learning in order to design more effective nutrition interventions. Cognitive learning theories suggest that prior knowledge and epistemology influence what is learned. The purpose of this study was to identify adult men's and women's knowledge about fat and cholesterol, their epistemic perspective within the nutrition context, and changes in knowledge after an educational intervention.    Men (n = 40) and women (n = 48), with median family incomes and at least high school educations, participated in a quasi-experimental study. Respondents participated in two semi-structured interviews designed to assess their knowledge; epistemic perspective was assessed in the first interview. Concept maps were used to represent respondents' knowledge structure by identifying concepts, relationships between concepts (propositions), and misconceptions. Belenky and other's (Women's Ways of Knowing, 1986) scheme was used to classify individuals into epistemic categories.    At Interview I, women had more (p $<$.05) knowledge integration (18.9 compared to 14.1) and misconceptions ($-$15.7 compared to $-$11.6) than the men, suggesting women had a more complex knowledge base. However, they were very similar in what they knew or did not know. Both genders had many misconceptions about fat and cholesterol which could interfere with learning or lead to poor dietary choices. Men learned more than women (20 and 9 point gains, respectively), perhaps because the topic was of greater interest to them. Eighty percent of the women had a subjective (experiential) epistemology, i.e., they relied on their own experiences for judging information and making decisions; half the men were also subjective, but 30% were received and 22% constructed.    Results can be used to design more effective interventions by building on what is known, providing for what is unknown, and addressing misconceptions. The experiential perspective suggests that more hands-on and participatory experiences are needed in nutrition education. The results indicate that for this middle-class, well-educated sample, who were interested in nutrition, there is no need to devise separate, gender-based interventions to teach about fat and cholesterol. The qualitative methods provided information unavailable from other, more quantitatively oriented methods.

T1  - The effects of hands-on science instruction on students' cognitive structures as measured by concept maps
AN  - 303878333
AB  - It has long been recognized that meaningful learning of science is a complex process requiring the integration of numerous concepts. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of hands-on science instruction on students' cognitive structuring of knowledge as measured by concept maps. Five intact classes of fifth graders were taught four one-week science lessons on astronomy, ecology, magnetism and pendulums. Students drew concept maps before and after instruction to illustrate the structure of their cognitive knowledge. Students also completed a science curiosity scale at the conclusion of the study to determine their interest and attitudes towards science, concept mapping and hands-on science instruction. The concept maps were submitted to data analysis using an ANOVA program. The null hypotheses being tested relating to the concept maps scores, specifically that there would be no difference between total concept maps scores for the hands-on students and students reading science and there would be no difference between individual categories of the maps (e.g. number of relationships, hierarchy, branching and cross links) for the experimental and control groups, were not rejected. Two additional null hypotheses relating to the students' views on concept mapping and hands-on science instruction were tested. The study rejected the hypothesis that students would have no preference for either hands-on instruction or direct instruction. Rather the students preferred the hands-on instructional methods. Students also indicated they learned more science by doing hands-on activities. The use of hands-on science instruction also promoted a positive attitude towards the study of science. When addressing the question of students' preference for concept mapping, the students demonstrated no preference for concept mapping, thereby rejecting the null hypothesis. While the data of this study failed to reject the majority of null hypotheses, patterns of nonstatistical changes were found. Because cognitive change requires a greater amount of time to occur it was the recommendation of this study that similar studies be conducted over a time period greater than one week. With additional time, it is felt that greater cognitive changes within the students will occur.

T1  - A case study of the effectiveness of concept mapping and vee diagramming in middle school science education
AN  - 303875968
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of two learning tools, concept mapping and vee diagramming, to improve the learning experience in science for public school students. One hundred fifty-eight (158) seventh grade students and one hundred forty-two (142) eighth grade students at Sweet Home Middle School, Amherst, NY made up the population studied (n = 300). Both grades were divided into classtypes, school and regular (below average and average) according to testing and sorting procedures of the school Guidance Department. The classtypes were either treated with an experimental unit of study (using concept mapping and vee diagramming techniques) or a control unit of traditional curriculum study. The teaching unit for the seventh grade students dealt with vascular and nonvascular plants. The teaching unit for the eighth grade study concerned chemical solutions.    The effectiveness of concept mapping and vee diagramming was measured by administering a pre and post test designed for each unit. Six teachers took the test as part of a pilot study for content validity and a KR$\sp{20}$ = 0.86 reliability was established. Embedded questions on concept mapping and vee diagramming were incorporated in the instrument.    The mean test scores on the post tests for the experimental groups were higher than those for the control groups in both grades and for all classtypes. A statistical analysis to investigate the hypothesis that concept mapping and vee diagramming would improve learning revealed that treatment group (i.e., experimental versus control) was a factor. The findings from the analysis of variance indicated that the improved performance on the post test by the 7th grade students (as a whole) could be attributed, in part, to the use of concept mapping and vee diagramming in the classroom. Treatment group was found not to be a significant contributing factor to the improved performance for the 8th grade level as a whole; however, it was a factor for the school classtype at that grade level.    The study findings suggest that use of concept mapping and vee diagramming in the classroom will improve learning. These tools offer an important avenue for achieving educational reform.

T1  - Conceptual change in introductory physics students
AN  - 303855788
AB  - It is well known that common sense beliefs about motion, which result in misconceptions, are very resilient and conventional physics instruction does very little to modify those ideas. The present study compared the effectiveness of a non-traditional method of instruction with the conventional mode of teaching in an introductory college level physics laboratory course. The non-traditional method, called the Socratic-Dialogue-Inducing (SDI) method involved discussion, drawing freebody diagrams, and interactive engagements of students in the laboratory. For the first six weeks of the semester two of the six laboratory sections were taught by the SDI method and the other four sections, the comparison groups, were taught by the traditional method.    Assessment of concepts held by the students was performed by comparing (1) the pre- and post-course mechanics test scores; (2) the concept maps generated from the responses received on the pre- and post-treatment Free Association Test; and (3) performance on the demonstration interviews. In addition, students' science anxiety and their attitude toward science laboratories were also assessed before and after the study.

T1  - The perceptions of human service workers in planning for the implementation of the family preservation services innovation in Indian child welfare settings
AN  - 303852637
AB  - This exploratory research investigated the perceptions of human service workers planning to implement an innovative service project, known as Family Preservation Services (FPS), in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and the Rio Grande Corridor of New Mexico. The study had workers identify implementation issues that needed to be dealt with in order to implement an FPS project, work through a procedure to show interrelationships among the issues, and rate the issues in terms of importance and ability to influence. The ratings for various subgroups of human service workers were then compared.    The research made use of a structured conceptualization research method known as Concept Mapping to gather and assess the perceptions of human service workers. Multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis, mean rating scores, and t-tests were employed to analyze the data.    Eighty-one implementation issues and six clusters, representing broader implementation concerns, were identified. The clusters and issues were able to be classified into those dealing with technical capacity matters and those attending to political feasibility factors. Importance ratings were consistently higher than influence ratings. The implementation clusters emphasizing technical capacity were rated as more important and more open to influence than the ones focusing on political feasibility. Political and technical issues directly tied to getting the project operational were seen as most important, and those issues dealing with activities and forces beyond the human service organization and community were seen as least susceptible to influence. In comparing subgroup ratings there was strong similarity between workers from New Mexico and Michigan and Indians serving as either managers or direct service practitioners. The largest degree of difference was found in comparing the ratings of Indian managers and non-Indian managers.    A Powerlessness Index was devised to determine the relative degree of powerlessness human service workers feel about implementation issues and general implementation concerns. Based upon the research an initial conceptual framework for pre-implementation planning was presented.

T1  - How do teachers know geometry? A multi-case study of secondary school geometry teachers' subject-matter and pedagogical content knowledge
AN  - 303849756
AB  - This study investigated the subject-matter and pedagogical content knowledge of four secondary-school geometry teachers in order to identify dimensions of their geometry knowledge, and the relationships between their subject-matter and pedagogical content knowledge. Sources of the teachers' content knowledge were also identified.    Inspired by the conclusions of recent research in cognitive science, especially expert-novice comparisons, the investigation took the form of four case studies and an extensive cross-analysis. The subjects were chosen according to a theoretical/purposive sampling technique on the basis of their interest, experience, and professional involvement in geometry and the teaching of geometry. Each teacher was observed for two weeks in the classroom and responded to seven interviews and tasks designed to elicit information about the content and organization of their subject-matter and pedagogical content knowledge in geometry. Tasks included constructing a concept map, planning a simulated teaching unit, and sorting geometry problems according to connections and perceived student difficulty.    Analysis of the four cases and cross-analysis revealed several dimensions of subject-matter knowledge and of pedagogical content knowledge. In addition, it was found that subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge seemed inextricably interwoven in the minds of the teachers in the study.    The sources of geometry content knowledge, as recalled by the teachers, were numerous and included colleagues, workshops and other in-service activities, and wide reading. Each teacher had learned some aspects of pedagogical content knowledge from a high school or college mathematics teacher, but none attributed the beginnings of such knowledge to an undergraduate mathematics methods course.    The findings of the study are discussed in the context of other research on teachers' content knowledge, and implications for further research and for mathematics teacher education are cited.

T1  - A study of students' thought processes and understanding of acid/base concepts during the performance of instrument-based titrations
AN  - 303841815
AB  - The study investigated the effect that levels of instrumentation during acid/base titration activities have on students' understandings of acid, base and pH concepts. Fifteen secondary chemistry students were divided into three treatment groups and performed a series of titrations: strong acid-strong base, weak acid-strong base, and polyprotic acid-strong base. One group used chemical indicators, another used a pH meter, and a third used a microcomputer interfaced to a pH probe (microcomputer-based laboratory or MBL).    Pretreatment and posttreatment interviews were conducted to determine students' acid/base concepts and how these concepts were integrated into their chemical knowledge. The interviews contained examples, nonexamples, and demonstrations of acid-base chemistry which students explained verbally and with drawings. The students were instructed to think aloud as they performed the titrations and were videotaped.    Concept maps were drawn from the interviews to detect conceptual change, and students' drawings were analyzed for their use of the molecular model of matter. All groups showed positive change. However, the MBL group attained more conceptual change and shifted to a more molecular model. The conceptual change was characterized by more integration of concepts as evidenced by cross linking on the maps, and the molecular model shift was shown by more ionic drawings.    The students' verbal commentaries were coded to determine how they accessed their knowledge of acids and bases. The verbal commentaries were also used to analyze the patterns of their activity as they performed the titrations. The verbal commentaries revealed no differences in patterns of activity across groups, but groups focused observations differently. The MBL group focused on the shape of the on-screen graph, the pH meter group focused on the movement of the pH meter needle and pH value displayed, and the chemical indicator group focused on various phenomena before focusing on color change.    The results indicate that MBL promises to promote conceptual change. One possible explanation is that the computer display functions as an auxiliary memory device, reducing processing demands on the short-term memory and freeing memory space for observations, conceptualization, and analysis.

T1  - Abstractional concept mapping: A formal basis for analogical reasoning
AN  - 303831188
AB  - We present a theory of analogical reasoning referred to as the Abstractional Concept Mapping Theory. The approach provides a formal basis for all "comparison-based reasoning" in that given any two descriptions in first-order logic, arbitrary comparisons of the descriptions are representable as first-order theories (referred to as "comparison theories"), dependent only on the notion of logical truth, and not on domain-specific heuristics or particular features of the knowledge representation. The process of analogical matching necessarily precedes the process of analogical inference. Therefore, this research addresses the question of how comparisons between two given descriptions can be discovered, represented, and used as a basis for analogical inference in intelligent systems. Two main beliefs behind our approach are the following: (a) the focus of such comparisons should be semantically based, rather than syntactically based, and (b) in order to represent arbitrary comparisons, the explicit representation of an abstraction common to the two descriptions is required.    A unique aspect of our theory is the explicit representation and mapping of concepts, as opposed to a symbol-to-symbol mapping, allowing for a semantic mapping in the representation of comparisons. Such concepts are denoted by lambda expressions. Given a pragmatic distinction of "background knowledge" and "situation-specific knowledge" in our approach, we see correspondences of analogous concepts across two domains of knowledge as the basis for interpretations of metaphor, and correspondences of statements of particular situations that are instantiations of analogous concepts as the basis for interpretations of analogy. Besides the identification of analogous concepts, equivalent concepts are also characterized within our theory. Thus, the Abstractional Concept Mapping Theory provides a means for the explicit representation of an abstraction (or "schema") common to two descriptions. Such abstractions capture what is literally or analogically similar across the descriptions, thus constituting a form of learning, besides providing a means of analogical matching prerequisite to a process of analogical inference.

T1  - Scoring student-generated concept maps in introductory college chemistry
AN  - 303797909
AB  - This study presents a method for scoring concept maps generated by students learning introductory college chemistry. Concept maps provide a visualization of cognitive structure. When a student draws a concept map for chemical reactions the result is a personification of the student's conceptual framework for understanding the concepts and propositions of chemical change. Developing a valid method for scoring student concept maps will enable educators to evaluate student knowledge free of the bias and arbitrariness often associated with qualitative reviews.    The scoring methodology presented in this study permits evaluation of the learning characteristics of students in chemistry. The concept map measures the amount of chemical information the student possesses, reasoning ability in chemistry, and the presence of specific misconceptions of introductory and physical chemistry concepts.    This research has demonstrated that the concept map category score for propositional validity reflects student reasoning ability in chemistry. The ratio of valid connecting lines to total number of connecting lines drawn (per strand) significantly correlated with formal reasoning ability in chemistry. The corresponding map category score for hierarchical structure reflects the amount of chemical information possessed by a student. Students who possess large amounts of information about chemistry position more vocabulary words within each hierarchical level than the student who demonstrates limited chemical knowledge.    The data in this research also suggest the greater a student's understanding of introductory chemistry concepts the more strands s/he employs in mapping concepts and propositions related to chemical reactions. Low strand count reflected specific misconceptions about Avogadro's Number, the mole concept, and the Law of Conservation of Matter.    Scoring Student-Generated Concept Maps In Introductory College Chemistry provides a method for objectively measuring student heuristic processing in chemistry. Utilizing student-generated concept maps enhances the teacher's diagnostic and instructional role in the classroom.

T1  - The use of concept maps in examining students' conceptions and structure of knowledge in science
AN  - 303797236
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the use of concept maps to examine and evaluate students' conceptions and structure of knowledge associated with a topic in biology as a result of intervention by computer assisted instruction.    This study examined the proposition that concept maps can detect the extent of understanding of science concepts and structure of knowledge. Specifically, the study sought to document differences in concept mapping scores and total number of critical concepts and propositions revealed in maps of students in the study.    A further analysis sought to validate the findings through in-depth interviews. In this phase of the study, interview responses of "novice" and "expert" mappers were analyzed for differences in total number of critical concepts and scientifically acceptable propositions.    Split plot ANOVA analysis showed that there was a significant difference between the experimental and control group on the unit test score (p =.0216) and each of the five concept map categories of Relationships (p =.0001), Hierarchy (p =.0001), Branching (p =.0001), Cross Link (p =.0007), and a small but significant difference on the General to Specific (p =.0415) category. The experimental and control group differed significantly on the total number of critical concepts (p =.0001) and critical propositions (p =.0001).    A comparison of interviews of "expert" and "novice" mappers revealed "experts" were able to generate a greater number of critical concepts and propositions than "novices". The most significant finding in this study was that concept maps as evaluative measures were able to reflect differences in the concept and propositional knowledge of learners even though subjects were introduced to the concept mapping technique in a relatively short period of time. Concept maps were sensitive as assessment measures of student's conceptions and structure of knowledge in science and as such may serve as valuable evaluative tools for instruction.

T1  - Search strategies for computer-stored information: A microcomputer tutorial
AN  - 303788678
AB  - This study developed and tested a microcomputer tutorial teaching end users basic search strategies for retrieving computer stored information, using Boolean Operators. The tutorial, based on Ausubel's Meaningful Learning Theory, Gagne's External Events of Instruction, and Novak's Concept Mapping Technique, consists of four Lessons and a Practice Exercise.    Evaluation of the tutorial consisted of content validation, pilot testing, and criterion validation. Thirty undergraduate education majors with no prior knowledge of online searching were randomly assigned to either the control or the experimental group, each consisting of 15 students. The experimental group worked through the tutorial; the control group was given a control tutorial.    After completing the programs, each member in both groups formulated three search statements on three topics selected by the researcher. Statements of both groups were input online into the ERIC database in natural language using Dialog. Searches were limited to 10 citations in full record format. The results yielded 638 documents, 234 from the control and 404 from the experimental group. Citations were evaluated for relevancy by the researcher using the binary system of judgment (yes, no). Relevancy was determined by descriptors or keywords in the abstract in correct context.    Viability of the tutorial as a method of teaching search strategies was established: mean precision score for the control group was 6.1%, the experimental group 49.36%. An obtained t ratio of 8.72 was larger than the table value of 2.048 to.05 level of confidence. The mean precision of 49.36% compares favorably with precision figures in literature which range from 42% to 70%.    Implications are manifold: information available on computer cannot be accessed by many. Thus the role of the librarian is changing from searcher of information to teaching searching skills, which can be enhanced with this tutorial. Similar role shifts for teachers can occur. Results indicate that persons with no knowledge of computer searching can learn searching skills quickly utilizing this tutorial. Judgments of relevancy, despite guidelines, are subjective.

T1  - An assessment of concept mapping as a learning tool for the science instructional laboratory
AN  - 303780638
AB  - Central to the purposes of this study was the investigation of differences on tests of comprehension and retention between a group of 51 ninth grade students trained to construct concept maps and a group of 53 ninth grade students not so trained. Comprehension and retention tests were based on concepts presented in a laboratory activity. Also considered were the differential effects several student skills and aptitudes had on the comprehension and retention tests and concept mapping performance.    For both the comprehension and retention tests there were no significant differences between the mapping and non-mapping group means. Regression equations for the ITED vocabulary subtest as a predictor variable for comprehension test performance had significantly different slopes. The regression line for the control group indicated a direct relationship between verbal ability and comprehension. While the line for the treatment group also indicated a direct relationship, its slope is flatter. In addition, the lines cross at a vocabulary subtest score of approximately 14. This is explained as an interaction between vocabulary skill and the construction of a concept map. Students with low vocabulary skills who constructed concept maps have higher predicted scores than similarly able students who did not map. Concept mapping students with higher vocabulary skills scored lower than those of similar abilities who did not map.    No significant differences in the slopes of regression lines predicting retention test scores between control and treatment groups were indicated for any measures. Number of map links and links per word appeared to be related to performance on the comprehension test. No map score was significantly correlated to the retention test. There were no significant regression equations between map words, map links, and links per word and the ability measures. None of the selected measures predicted performance on concept maps.

T1  - Effects of concept mapping on meaningful learning and achievement in chemistry
AN  - 303780055
AB  - Purpose. This study examines the effects of concept mapping on meaningful learning and achievement in chemistry and investigates how the student's attitude toward mapping affects his/her ability to master mapping strategies and acquire meaningful learning. Concept mapping is an organizational strategy for showing meaningful relationships between new information and one's existing knowledge base. Previous research indicates that in chemistry "rote" recall is over-emphasized, and students may not be challenged to acquire meaningful learning. Novak and Gowin (1984) and others have shown mapping to be effective in promoting meaningful learning.    Methods and procedures. The design allowed for 53 subjects to be placed into two groups and randomly chosen to receive the treatment or controlled instruction for fifteen weeks. All students received similar chemistry instruction. The treatment group was given mapping instruction, constructed maps, and completed attitudinal evaluations toward mapping on a regular basis.    Results. Analysis of posttest results revealed no significant differences between groups on measures for meaningful learning and achievement in chemistry at the $p\ <$.05 level. Further analysis indicated no significant relationships among mapping scores and posttest performance. Analysis of variance results for successive, intermediate maps revealed a significant main effect at the $p\ <$.05 level. No significant difference existed between groups for posttest attitudes toward science and the regular classroom. No significant relationships existed among attitude toward mapping and meaningful learning, achievement, and final mapping scores.    Conclusions. For this study, concept mapping did not enhance meaningful learning or achievement in chemistry. Concept mapping did not affect students' attitudes toward science or the regular classroom. These findings contradict previous research, and generalizability may be limited. Mapping performance was not related to meaningful learning and achievement. Students' attitudes toward mapping had no effect upon meaningful learning, achievement, or mapping performance. Attitudinal data toward mapping revealed mixed results with a general preponderance of negative views. Although students experienced difficulty in constructing maps, they were able to master mapping after 15 weeks of instruction, and they did recognize the importance and potential of mapping to enhance learning.

T1  - Concept mapping and achievement in high school biology and chemistry
AN  - 303760454
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine the effect on chemistry and biology student achievement of the concept mapping technique. The relationships between past achievement (as measured by the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills) and student achievement (as measured by posttest scores) were also studied. Also of interest was the determination of whether the concept mapping technique was more suitable for either biology or chemistry.    The study was conducted during the spring term of 1985 at a public high school in east central Florida. Intact classes of average ability students (107 biology and 44 chemistry) were administered pretests one week before the study began. This test covered content that was to be taught during the upcoming three week unit. Beginning with the next class period after the pretest, the treatment group was taught the concept mapping technique for a period of one week.    For the next three weeks all the students (four biology sections and two chemistry sections) received regular course instruction. However, fifteen minutes before the end of each class period, the treatment and control groups received a list of concepts covered during the class period. The treatment groups were asked to construct concept maps while the control groups were asked to define the concepts. Maps and definitions were turned in at the end of the period to be graded and returned to the students the following day. After three weeks, posttests were given over the material covered.    Based on data provided by the tests as analyzed by ANCOVA via MRC, there was no significant difference in achievement between students assigned concept maps and students required to complete concept definitions. There was a significant interaction effect on achievement between concept maps versus concept definitions and prior achievement as measured by CTBS scores. The CTBS treatment/control interaction revealed that students with "lower" CTBS scores did better on the posttest when using concept maps and the students with "higher" CTBS scores did better when merely defining the concepts.    There was no significant interaction effect on achievement between students who constructed concept maps versus defined concepts, and content area (biology or chemistry).

AB  - Baccalaureate nursing students were taught basic nursing skills with two cognitive strategies that consciously identify and reinforce connections between scientific theory and practice, namely (a) "Vees" which are heuristics to identify theory in terms of concepts, principles, theory body and philosophy; and practice in terms of theory driven, specific steps; and (b) concept maps which are schematic depictions of one's cognitive structures. As part of the research, extensive Vee heuristics and concept maps for a basic nursing curriculum were produced. The research evaluated if students who were taught basic nursing skills in a simulated college laboratory setting with Vee heuristics and concept maps rather than with traditional modes would to a statistically significant degree: (1) better identify the theory base for specific nursing skills (yes), (2) perform basic nursing skills in practiced situations more effectively (no), (3) state intended actions for novel situations (no), and (4) perceive their learning as more meaningful (no).    The theoretical framework was based on the cognitive learning theories of Ausubel, Novak and Gowin which claim (a) meaningful learning occurs when new knowledge is connected to prior knowledge in ways that strongly link the two, (b) concept maps help construct and identify one's own cognitive structure, and (c) links between theory and practice can be constructed.    The research was quasi-experimental with a nonequivalent control group design (n = 42). Three instructors each taught weekly labs in (a) a traditional mode (demonstration, practice, return demonstration), and (b) a treatment mode (demonstration, practice and return demonstration with the discussion of student-made concept maps and instructor-made Vees about weekly skills).    Students using Vee heuristics and concept maps felt (a) their style of learning was changed although the interventions were not the specified reasons, (b) positively about learning with Vee heuristics (81%) and concept maps (69%), and (c) that these materials helped them "put it (knowledge and skills) all together" in contrast with control students who felt they learned meaningfully that which "was expected".

T1  - The effects of kinetic structure on cognitive structure during instruction
AN  - 303698961
AB  - Concept Maps were used to study the cognitive structure of 46 high school physics student while they were being instructed. Students were given lessons using various degrees of structure as determined by Anderson's system of Kinetic Structure Analysis. Results were analyzed to determine what effect verbal structure had on the cognitive structure of the students.    Divergent and predictive cognition among the students was also evaluated using the concept maps. Results were analyzed to determine what effect kinetic structure had on these variables. While several trends were apparent, it was determined that there was no effect on cognition due to differences in kinetic structure. It was suggested that the extremely large variability among the concept map scores may have masked any significant relationship between kinetic structure and cognition.    The correlations between productive, predictive and divergent cognition were also analyzed. It was found that there were no significant correlations.    Post hoc analyses were undertaken to examine certain interactions which were apparent after statistical analyses were examined. These analyses suggested (1) productive cognition was significantly dependent on the content of lessons, (2) predictive cognition was dependent on the class grouping.    Finally, the advantages and disadvantages of concept maps as research tools are discussed. The use of concept maps to study cognition during instruction is considered to be ground-breaking in the area of cognition. This study indicated that this technique may be a viable tool for further studies of this type.

T1  - The impact of a nutrition education program on health perceptions of children
AN  - 303722471
AB  - The purpose of the study was to investigate the degree to which young children included nutrition in their perceptions of health. The study also examined the impact of a home-based nutrition education program (Hearthrob) that focused on heart disease prevention and health promotion with regard to whether program participation increased children's perception that health and nutrition were related concepts. It was hypothesized that young children did not perceive nutrition as a meaningful concept in its relation to their health perceptions and that as a result of participation in the Hearthrob program children would (1) increase their perception that health and nutrition were related concepts and/or (2) come to perceive nutrition as a meaningful concept in relation to their health perceptions.    A pretest/posttest experimental design was used. Children in the treatment group immediately began the 4-week nutrition education program. An interview instrument was developed for measuring children's health perceptions. The instrument employed both open- and closed-ended questions and was used to interview 60 healthy children, aged 4 to 7 years, who were assigned to treatment and control groups. Health perception scores were derived from children's responses. Concept mapping, a type of content analysis, was used to score the open-ended questions. After a follow-up interview with both treatment and control subjects, initial and final health perception scores were compared for changes in children's health perceptions as a result of program participation.    Results indicated that children did perceive nutrition as a meaningful concept in its relation to their health perceptions. Following program participation, children increased their perception that health and nutrition were related concepts and/or came to perceive nutrition as a meaningful concept in its relation to their health perceptions. The Hearthrob program was successful in encouraging children to increase their perception that health and nutrition were related concepts.

T1  - Conceptual change strategies within cooperative groups of community college chemistry students: An experiment
AN  - 303714175
AB  - This study assessed the potential of small cooperative groups incorporating conceptual change strategies to improve concept learning of community college students. A pretest-posttest, control group experimental design was used. Two sections of introductory chemistry functioned as the treatment group and worked in small groups as a supplement to direct instruction on tasks designed to promote conceptual change for the concepts of the laws of conservation of matter and energy and the particulate nature of gases, liquids, and solids. Tasks included answering questions aimed at eliciting misconceptions and concept mapping of course content. Student interaction was audiotaped and transcribed and these transcriptions provided detailed information about student participation and understanding. Two other sections served as the control group, received the same classroom instruction, but were given demonstrations related to the course content in lieu of small group work. Two experimental instructors each taught one treatment and one control group.    Chi-square analysis of pretests indicated an equivalence of groups with respect to the proportion of students with misconceptions. On the posttest, treatment students had a significantly (p $<$.05) lower proportion of students with misconceptions than control students for the concepts of the conservation laws and the particulate nature of liquids and solids.    Transcriptions of verbal interaction were coded to identify evidence of conditions to promote or impede conceptual change suggested by Posner et al. (1982) and others. Five of the eight groups audiotaped had verbal behavior suggestive of all four conditions of the conceptual change process (e.g. dissatisfaction with preconceptions, and perceptions of intelligibility, plausibility, and utility of new concepts). All the individuals, who had evinced all four conditions, achieved correct concepts on the posttest. High frequency of verbal behavior suggestive of impeding conceptual change was associated with not undergoing conceptual change.    Qualitative analysis of group behavior suggested an impeding effect on interaction and understanding by flawed understanding of basic science terms, student views of school tasks and science learning, and roles played by adult group leaders. These themes were examined and illustrated.

T1  - A conceptualization of learning, teaching and research experiences of women scientists and its implications for science education
AN  - 303699304
AB  - Nine women scientists were interviewed about their learning, teaching and research experiences. A philosophy of pluralism and a constructivist epistemology supported the use of women's experience as a legitimate source of knowledge. Naturalistic inquiry provided the methodological paradigm. Analysis of the interview data was by concept and proposition analysis and concept-mapping, from which an interpretive narrative was constructed.    Recent studies concerning gender and science have been in the history of women in science, employment opportunities and status, research on sex differences, and societal and cultural beliefs of and about science evidenced by women's absence from the field. This study connects the learning, research and teaching experiences of women scientists to the educational commonplaces of teacher, learner, curriculum and governance; the basic elements in schools and science classrooms.    The implications for science educating follow from the patterns interpreted from these women's experience. They are constructivist learners in their research approach; understanding the structure of science is empowering in their attempts to come to know; they connect learning and thinking in science with intense and positive feelings of commitment; the structure of their research is based on a notion of order rather than a search for law; their "public" beliefs about science reflect the larger scientific community; and they are not aggressively competitive. These experiences raise questions about societal and cultural beliefs about gender and science; beliefs that have discouraged women's advancement in science.    The connected knowledge from this research supports a theory of educating that places the learner at the center of knowledge-making, determines the learner's prior concepts, recognizes the role of feelings, and allows, encourages and supports the expression and validation of silenced and unvoiced experience as valid sources of knowledge through enlightened teaching practice and appropriate curriculum content. Beliefs held by students and teachers about nature and science and the issues raised by this research on "listening to women in science" need to be addressed by further research in science education, in the education of future science teachers, in the in-service education of present science teachers, and within the classroom.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping and cognitive style on science achievement
AN  - 303643953
AB  - Purposes. The purposes of this study were to determine: (a) the effectiveness of the concept-mapping strategy as used in teaching science; (b) whether a field-dependent or field-independent group of students has higher achievement; (c) the interaction between instructional treatment and students' cognitive style; (d) the interaction between instructional treatment and student's sex; and (e) the interaction between instructional treatment, student's sex, and student's cognitive style.    Method and procedure. The subjects were 156 eighth-grade students enrolled in earth science classes from three schools in the Atlanta public schools. The three teachers involved attended workshop training where the concept-mapping strategy was presented. Each teacher taught the instructional unit to a group using the concept-mapping strategy and to another group using an outlining study guide. The Group Embedded Figures Test was administered to identify the students' cognitive style (field-dependent or field-independent). The same achievement test was given as a pretest and posttest.    Results. The analysis of variance and analysis of covariance revealed the following: (a) statistical significant difference among schools, (b) significant difference due to interaction of method and school, (c) no statistical difference among the subjects by instructional method used, and (d) no difference by cognitive style grouping. There was no difference in the interactions of: (a) instructional method and students' cognitive style, (b) instructional method and students' sex, and (c) instructional method, students' sex, and students' cognitive style. Stepwise regression analysis showed significant correlations between the dependent variable (posttest scores) and the following independent variables: school, pretest scores, and reading scores. Response to one-on-one interviews showed that students developed positive attitudes for the concept-mapping strategy.    Conclusions. Although there was no statistical significant difference between the two groups, the means of the posttest scores for the students in the concept-mapping group were higher than the means for the students in the outlining study guide group. There was no significant difference between achievement scores of field-dependent and field-independent students. Based on the one-on-one interviews, students responded favorably to the concept-mapping strategy.

T1  - A remediation program in science based upon learning theory for incoming associate degree nursing students
AN  - 303551601
AB  - The need for science remediation is at a crisis condition in many associate degree colleges. Through the process of open admissions, these colleges admit many nontraditional students who lack a strong science background. While many of these students choose majors that require a basic knowledge of science, many fail out of these programs because of their science deficiencies. This is especially true in nursing programs where attrition rates of around thirty to forty percent are common.    Using learning principles of Ausubel, a science remediation course was designed and implemented for potentially weak science students just entering an associate degree nursing program. The purpose of this course was to strengthen their conceptual framework in science and to increase their scientific problem solving ability.    The course ran for two weeks during the summer. Fifty-two students needed remediation based upon their previous science grades, SAT's, and NLN pre-nursing guidance test scores. However, only sixteen students could commit themselves to attend the program.    The selection of science concepts came from an analysis of past studies and a survey of physical science textbooks. The researcher viewed problem solving as a twofold process: an ability to utilize concepts and to think abstractly. The use of student structured concept maps incorporating Ausubel's principle of meaningful learning helped strengthen the conceptual framework of students. The use of inquiry labs encouraged problem solving ability.    Program evaluation involved a pre- and posttest in the science content and in abstract thinking ability. For purposes of comparisons, all fifty-two students needing remediation took the posttest. The success rate of the remedial students in the first regular science course was also compared to non-remediated students from the previous year. Finally the remedial students completed an affective evaluation instrument after the remedial course and again after the first regular science course.    Results showed that students did improve in their knowledge of the basic concepts and, to a lesser extent, in their abstract thinking ability. However, while many thought the remediation course helpful, there was no significant improvement in their overall success rate.

T1  - Building an organized knowledge base: Concept mapping and achievement in secondary school physics
AN  - 303649910
AB  - Purpose. The improvement of problem solving among high school physics students was the aim of this study. A review of the research indicated that direct teaching of problem solving methods had met with little success. Expert problem solving depended upon an organized knowledge base. The concept map was found to be a key to organizing an effective knowledge base. The investigation of the effect of the degree of concept mapping on achievement was the purpose of this dissertation.    Methods and procedures. Six intact high school physics classes, taught by this investigator, took part in the study. Two classes were control groups and received standard instruction. Four classes received six weeks of concept mapping instruction prior to the unit under study. Two of these four classes were the low level treatment group and were required to submit concept maps at the conclusion of the instruction. The other two classes were the high level treatment group and were required to submit concept maps at the beginning and at the conclusion of the unit under study. One class from each treatment group took a pretest prior to instruction.    A factorial analysis of variance of the posttest results was performed to determine if any pretest-posttest interaction was present. A one-way analysis of covariance of the posttest scores was performed to determine treatment effects. The Scholastic Achievement Test Math (SATM) score was the covariant. Single-df comparisons of the adjusted treatment means were performed to determine the effectiveness of the degree of concept mapping.    Results. An analysis of the posttest results revealed no pretest sensitization. A one-way analysis of covariance indicated a significant main effect at the p $<$.05 level. A pair of single-df comparisons of the adjusted treatment means resulted in significant differences (p $<$.05) between the control group and the average of the treatment means as well as between the two experimental groups.    Conclusion. It can be concluded that for this sample (upper middle class high school physics students) mapping concepts prior to, during, and subsequent to instruction led to greater achievement as measured by posttest scores.

T1  - Development and summative evaluation of directed inquiry approach to learning science process skills in biology
AN  - 303612601
AB  - This study addressed the need to help high school students develop critical thinking skills required to solve problems in the biology laboratory. To address this need, the Directed Inquiry Approach to Learning Science Process Skills and Scientific Problem Solving (DIAL(SPS)2) was developed and tested. This lab curriculum integrated several learning strategies: directed learning activity, advance organizers, learning cycle, concept maps, Vee diagrams, focusing, and writing.    This study addressed three research questions. First, what effect does DIAL(SPS)2 treatment have on science process skills acquisition? Second, what effect does DIAL(SPS)2 have on cognitive development? Third, how do academic ability, cognitive development, previous content knowledge, attitude, language preference, and gender affect student ability to learn and to perform science process skills? Three instruments were used to measure science process skills: the Test of Integrated Process Skills (TIPS) (Dillashaw & Okey, 1980), the Processes of Biological Inquiry Test (PBIT), and the Science Process Skills Inventory (SPSI). PBIT was developed and validated in this study. SPSI was adapted from work by Tamir and Glassman (1970) to evaluate science process skills in the practical mode (Tamir, 1972). Lawson's Classroom Test of Formal Operations (1978) measured cognitive development. Student characteristics included academic ability as measured by SRA achievement, gender, age, language preference, and attitude toward science. Attitude Toward Science in School Assessment (ATSSA) was developed and validated in this study to measure how students feel about science as a school subject.    Four biology classes taught by the investigator were used. Students were not randomly assigned. Student scheduling involved ability grouping. To test the curriculum most rigorously, the experimental group consisted of average ability students and the comparison group consisted of above average ability students. Both experimental and comparison groups were pretested in August and posttested in May. Experimental group received DIAL(SPS)2 treatment while comparison group received a traditional approach.    Analysis of covariance revealed that DIAL(SPS)2 had no significant effect on science process skill learning or on cognitive development. Aptitude-treatment interaction analysis revealed interaction of treatment and cognitive development. Results are discussed within the context of implications for research and practice.

T1  - ENHANCING MEANINGFUL LEARNING IN AN ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION PROGRAM: A CASE STUDY OF A CLASS EMPOWERED THROUGH THE USE OF NOVAK'S AND GOWIN'S PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING HOW TO LEARN, CONCEPT MAPPING, INTERVIEWING, AND EDUCATING
AN  - 303571094
AB  - This research involves a case study of learning and educating of an 11th grade class (63 students) within the Eilat Eco-Field-Shop (EFS) program at the Environmental Education High School at Sede-Boker, Israel. It considered their conceptual structures, and their educational changes during the winter of 1986.    Gowin's theory of educating and Ausubel's-Novak's theory of meaningful learning, and the Sede-Boker version of Environmental Education provided the theoretical basis for the study. Novak's and Gowin's "Learning How to Learn" course and the techniques of concept mapping and interviewing serve as the educative strategies used in the class and in the field. The study is organized using Gowin's Vee heuristic. Three clusters of events were studied and recorded: the Pre-EFS events (including the Learning How to Learn course); the EFS events (including one week of studies in the city of Eilat); and the Post-EFS events. Records included interview transcripts, concept maps, video-tape recordings, and students' records of exams and planning projects.    The knowledge claims of the study are: (1) Even a short course of Learning How to Learn has a significant impact on moving students towards meaningful learning. (2) Meaningful learning is fostered mainly during the Pre-EFS phase (284%), and less than was expected during the EFS phase in the city of Eilat (19%). Rote learners fail to make integrations while meaningful learners make new connections and new meanings. (3) Integration of thinking, feeling and acting (TFA), is associated with meaningful learning. All the Meaningful learners integrate TFA during the whole study (90-100%), while only 38% of the rote learners integrate in class, and 90% during the field studies. (4) Concept mapping and interviewing are far more sensitive and accurate evaluating tools than the 'objective' tests used in the study.    Three value claims can be made out of this study: (1) Novak's and Gowin's strategies are useful for enhancing and evaluating meaningful learning. (2) The real-concrete environment do not replace the classroom construction of knowledge by students. (3) Studying in the field has a positive influence on learning, feelings, and educating.

T1  - THE CONSTRUCTION OF CONCEPT MAPS FACILITATES THE LEARNING OF GENERAL COLLEGE CHEMISTRY: A CASE STUDY
AN  - 303472868
AB  - General College Chemistry consists of a wide variety of complex subject areas. It is difficult to teach the conceptual unity within or between subject areas. Further, the student usually learns chemistry by passively accepting and committing the subjects to memory. This study investigated the possibility of using the concept map educational strategy to assist the student to develop conceptual relationships and unity in the subject matter and to become an active participant in his learning. The study looked at both the methodological question of integrating concept mapping into an already busy curriculum and the effect it had on student learning: both their learning of chemistry and their understanding of how they learn.    A case study research method was chosen. The boundaries defining the case were four students enrolled in my first semester General Chemistry course during the spring, 1982, semester at Broome Community College, Binghamton, New York.    The students were initially given guidelines for constructing concept maps. They were assigned the construction of concept maps of textbook chapters in three phases of increasing complexity and student independence.    I interviewed the students during each phase concerning their maps and, again, three months after the semester's end.    The data collected were of four types: the student constructed concept maps, the taped interviews, the day-to-day log I kept of the class, and the students' answers to quizzes and examinations.    The data were analyzed by evaluating each piece of datum and then uniting the data in two ways. First, they were woven back together across time to develop the case study of each student. Second, they were analyzed across students to identify common factors.    These analyses led me to the following main findings: (1) Concept mapping can be incorporated in a chemistry course and it provides the instructor with a clear picture of a student's understanding/misunderstanding. (2) Students gain a more complete, unified understanding of chemistry through concept map construction. (3) Students come to understand how they learn through concept map construction. (4) Students feel their concept maps are good representations of their understanding. (5) Concept maps can be valuable evaluation tools.

T1  - EVALUATION OF CONCEPT MAPPING AS A TOOL FOR MEANINGFUL EDUCATION OF COLLEGE BIOLOGY STUDENTS
AN  - 303471947
AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate concept mapping as a tool for meaningful education. Did concept mapping enhance meaningful learning and help integrate students' thinking, feelings, and actions?    An experimental group which mapped for three study units was compared to a control group which used traditional study methods in an autotutorial college biology setting. Students were initially tested upon finishing the third unit and posttested after five months. Tests were interview and multiple choice. Knowledge acquisition, retention, and learning efficiency were compared between mappers and control using t tests. Interactions of independent variables were studied using split plot ANOVA and regression analyses. The Thinking-Feeling-Acting Questionnaire, Final Evaluation, and anecdotal long term feedback assessed student views of how mapping affected thinking. Correlation coefficients for the three parts of the questionnaire were calculated.    There were no statistically significant differences between mapper and control groups. However, all dependent variables showed trends (P = .08 to .35 on interview measures and P = .07 to .13 on multiple choice measures) favoring mappers. Split plot ANOVA analyses showed that SAT and cognitive structure affected student response to mapping (P = .04). While there was a tendency for high-SAT control to outscore high-SAT mapper on the initial test, the opposite was true on the posttest; low-SAT subgroups showed no statistically significant differences. While there was a statistically significant difference on combined initial and posttests between high- and low-cognitive controls (P = .01), there was no such difference between comparable mappers (P = .69). Students felt mapping increased their integration of knowledge, helped to make sense of the material, clarified connections among concepts and helped them spend less time memorizing. Correlations of thinking, feeling, and acting questionnaire parts were positive.    Concept mapping appeared to slowly enhance meaningful learning as shown by questionnaires and trends favoring mappers, but with no general statistically significant differences between mapper and control. Mapping was approached integratively. Mapping shows potential as a tool for meaningful education in classrooms and in continuing education for a Learning Society.

T1  - A method for representing and comparing content and cognitive structures
AN  - 301439586
AB  - A method has been developed to represent the content structure of the concepts which are the fundamental ideas of a chemical topic taught to students or presented in instructional materials. The content structures can be analysed in terms of i) instructional sequence; ii) emphasis on abstract or concrete ideas; iii) logical or illogical relationships between generalizations and examples and iv) effect of repetition of conceptual relationships. The representation of the content structures is done using a concept map on which a transparent sheet is superimposed to represent the students' cognitive structures. This visual comparison may reveal the extent to which the students' cognitive structures reflect the content structure of the main key concepts. The method developed was applied to investigate influences of instructional materials on the learning outcomes of two Brazilian secondary school courses. In these courses, different material, content organization and teaching and learning activities were used to teach the same chemical topic. Course A was entirely centred on content and course B was based on a guided discovery approach. In both, substance and mixture were the main key concepts of the topic. Representations of the students' cognitive structures were obtained pre-and post instruction by analysing written essays and interviews. The learning promoted in both groups was low and usually corresponded to the most frequently repeated conceptual relationships in the content structures of substance and mixture. Misconceptions were promoted in course A due to the emphasis on abstract ideas and to the lack of operational distinctions between substances and mixtures. These findings were not identified in course B. Here, the low concordance between content and cognitive structures was probably due to a lack of examples and to the poor relationship between the teaching and the students' previous knowledge. From the main findings of this study, some suggestions for revision of the teaching materials are presented. Suggestions about how to improve the method for representing explanations and the `core' of a chemical topic are also discussed. In addition, a simpler version of the method is proposed. This could be used in teaching, for selecting textbooks and for developing instructional materials. (D74308/87)

T1  - AN IDENTIFICATION OF MISCONCEPTIONS IN BIOLOGY, THEIR NATURE, AND THEIR ACCOMMODATION DURING INSTRUCTION
AN  - 303549222
AB  - This study sought, first to identify some biological misconceptions which are present in a significant number of high school and lower division college students. It also tried to determine some of the origins of these misconceptions. Secondly, some prescribed forms of instruction which accommodate misconceptions were tested.    Tests that were designed to reveal misconceptions with regard to the animal concept, food webs, gene behavior, and plant respiration/photosynthesis, were administered to a sample of high school and lower division college students during the first part of the study. The answers on the tests revealed a significant presence of misconceptions among the subjects. A significant number of answers reflected an archaic pattern of thought, and a pattern of thought that projects casual experiences onto scientific settings.    A test of free association was administered along with some items designed to reveal misconceptions with regard to gene behavior. The results showed a significant relationship between holding certain misconceptions and a deficiency in associating these concepts to other related concepts.    The second part of the study sought to test whether a method of instruction that calls the students' attention to misconceptions would be more effective in remediating misconceptions than a control method of instruction. Both methods followed the same instructional strategy in teaching a biological content about plant respiration/photosynthesis at the high school level. The teaching strategy consisted of a semi-guided discovery approach. The only difference between the control and the experimental methods was that the latter used some instructional tools, explanations, discussions, and a concept map, especially designed to focus the students' attention on misconceptions. The results of the experiment showed the instructional method that called the students' attention to misconceptions, significantly more effective in accommodating misconceptions than the control method of instruction.

T1  - THE USE OF A CONCEPT MAPPING STRATEGY TO FACILITATE MEANINGFUL LEARNING FOR NINTH GRADE STUDENTS IN SCIENCE
AN  - 303529244
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the use of concept mapping, after Novak, as a strategy to facilitate meaningful learning based on a theoretical structure. The effect of this instructional strategy was assessed in terms of comparative group means on cognitive learning. Comparisons were made by method, prior knowledge and gender. Attitude changes were also examined. Based on random assignment of groups and prior group comparisons, this study utilized the pre-test/post-test true experimental design. Analysis of the outcomes also included the interaction of students' cognitive performance level and their abilities to use the concept mapping strategy.    This study involved 429 science students, being the entire ninth grade in the cooperating district's two junior high schools. Students were heterogenously assigned by computer to science classes of four participating teachers, and intact classes were utilized and randomly assigned to three groups: an experimental group which utilized the mapping process; a traditional group which was taught by the "traditional" teaching strategy; and a control group, denied the experimental and traditional treatments. All students were pre-tested prior to treatment and post-tested at the conclusion of the study for cognitive gains and attitudes.    The study involved four phases:  (1) the establishment of a locale for the research and development of instructional strategy; (2) instruction of participating teachers in the concept mapping strategy; (3) the implementation of the strategy; and (4) the statistical analysis of the results.    The experimental and traditional groups did significantly better on the content post-test than the control group while the experimental group using the mapping process did only slightly better than the traditional group. While the mapping process was not a significant factor in effecting academic achievement, the study showed that males did significantly better than females on the mapping process. Females showed a more improved attitude toward science.

T1  - A TWELVE-YEAR STUDY OF CHILDREN'S UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER AFTER AUDIO-TUTORIAL INSTRUCTION IN GRADES ONE AND TWO
AN  - 303399198
AB  - This study investigated children's conceptions about the particle theory of matter and how these conceptions changed over time. The study was based on previously collected data from the Audio-Tutorial Elementary Science Program (A-TESP). Tape interview recordings of twenty-one instructed and matched uninstructed children were considered. These tapes were transcribed, concept-mapped and scored.    The patterns of results between instructed and uninstructed children were remarkably different across and in between study periods; instructed children did not perform equally well on all interview events but tended to hold more foundation knowledge on which to build a particulate model of solids and liquids. The quality of conceptions also seemed to have been facilitated by the children's prior conceptual frameworks but the rate of concept acquisition and differentiation was not linearly related to the grade level, age or SAT ranks of children. The prominent feature that seemed to separate instructed and uninstructed children was diversity in the quality or inclusiveness of conceptions they held. Instructed children tended to hold more inclusive or high-ranking conceptions than their counterparts. In both groups, learning of new concepts included acquisition of several incorrect conceptions or ideas along the way. Uninstructed children were more likely to develop misconceptions about the particle theory of matter than their counterparts. There appeared to be some association between the number and nature of conceptions held and gender of child at the tenth grade; boys' level of conceptualization was better than girls'.    It is suggested that teachers understand the learner's conceptions about both the subject matter and what he or she believes learning and studying involve. Metalearning strategies to facilitate concept acquisition also ought to be considered.

T1  - UNDERSTANDING PHYSICS? A CONCEPTUALIZATION OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' THINKING AND ITS IMPLICATIONS FOR TEACHING AND TEACHERS
AN  - 303398675
AB  - Conducted in the spirit of Schwab's "fluid inquiry" this study explored students' conceptions of "understanding" in high school physics classrooms. The researcher attended the same physics lessons as students, and over a ten-week period in two schools, interviewed fifty-one students. She audio-taped and transcribed these interviews, coded and "concept-mapped" students' answers, and analyzed them for regularities to conceptualize the meanings students construct as "understanding." Ausubel's and Novak's theory of meaningful learning and Gowin's theory of "educating" were the guiding educational theories.    The study found that students' meanings of "understanding" could be conceptualized based on their experiences and knowledge from both inside and outside the physics classroom. The interaction between these two "domains" of their experiences can be synthesized into four conceptions of "understanding" physics by students. "Understanding(,1)" comes from relating new physics knowledge and experiences from outside the physics classroom; "understanding(,2)" is being able to "work" inside the classroom, eg. carry out experiments or solve problems; "understanding(,3)" comes from interrelating new physics knowledge with knowledge and experiences inside the physics classroom; and "understanding(,4)" is being able to use physics concepts to explain a broad range of everyday experiences outside the physics classroom. These findings have expanded the ways we conceptualize understanding in high school physics classrooms. They suggest another way of describing the character of what is meaningful to students in the physics classroom.    Further analyses of the findings provided the following insight for futher study:  (1) some students may be making an effort to establish what Dewey referred to as "continuity of experiences" between their different domain of experiences; (2) the interplay of students' idiosyncratic everyday experiences and physics classroom experiences will require teachers constantly to reconstruct what it means to understand and teach physics, so that they too become "students" in the classroom; (3) teaching may be conceptualised based on harmonious interaction with and among students' changing conceptual frameworks; (4) teachers, no less than students, need awareness of themselves as learners trying to understand their own classroom experiences.

T1  - AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF TEACHER KNOWLEDGE AND TEACHING: THE EFFECTS OF SCIENCE TEACHERS' KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT-MATTER AND THEIR CONCEPTIONS OF LEARNING ON THEIR TEACHING (RESEARCH, CONCEPTUAL CHANGE, SECONDARY)
AN  - 303416373
AB  - The study aimed to describe science teacher subject-matter knowledge and aspects of teacher conceptions of the learner and learning. It investigated the effects of those two domains of teacher knowledge and beliefs on aspects of preactive and simulated interactive teaching.    The sample consisted of six experienced secondary-school teachers--three specializing in physics and three in biology. Each teacher's knowledge of a biology and of a physics topic was assessed using summary free recall, concept-map line labeling, and sorting tasks. The teachers' conceptions of learning were assessed using the clinical interview method. Each teacher's planning and simulated teaching of each of the two topics were assessed using thinking-aloud and critical-incidents techniques. The teachers individually participated in four sessions lasting a total of five to seven hours. The sessions were audio-recorded and transcribed. The transcripts were subjected to content analysis.    Teacher subject-matter knowledge was found to vary on each of four dimensions:  (a) knowledge of topic, (b) knowledge of other discipline concepts, principles, and topics, (c) knowledge of conceptual schemes, (d) knowledge of approaches, or of ways of connecting the topic to other discipline entities.    Teacher prior subject-matter knowledge influenced the transformation of a written curriculum into an enacted one during preactive teaching through modifications in text-book subject-matter content and organization and through the use of explanatory representations. These effects of subject-matter knowledge were also apparent during simulated interactive teaching through the teachers' evaluative structures and responses to critical incidents.    Only the four teachers who held cognitive views of learning planned to confront students preconceptions. Two of these teachers held a conceptual change view of learning. These teachers had a greater variety of strategies for inducing conceptual change, strategies that addressed the persistence of preconceptions, the acquisition of scientific conceptions, and the occurrence of cognitive restructuring.    A third domain--teacher subject-matter pedagogical knowledge--consisted of knowledge of cases, primarily of how-to-teach particular topics. Each case was multi-faceted, with facets such as the levels of treatment of the topic or student preconceptions and how to deal with them.    Implications of this research for the evaluation of subject-matter and pedagogical knowledge among teachers were discussed.

T1  - CONCEPT MAPPING, VEE DIAGRAMS AND INDIVIDUAL INTERVIEWS APPLIED TO THE DESIGN OF MARINE TRADES ADULT EXTENSION CURRICULA AND ORGANIZATIONAL FEEDBACK SYSTEMS (COGNITIVE, NATURAL RESOURCES)
AN  - 303394100
AB  - This study, in the broadest sense, answers the question, "How does a theory of educating come to bear on extension education?" It seeks to fulfill the need for the incorporation of scientific research (curriculum), to extension programming (teaching) for identified audiences (learners). A comprehensive theory of educating, based on modern learning theory and epistemology, is applied to an important N.Y. Sea Grant Program area; the marine trades.    A total of thirty-eight individual interviews with charter captains, marina operators was conducted in the Lake Ontario, Hudson River and Long Island regions of New York State. Sea Grant Institute research which applied to the marine trades was identified and then analyzed using Gowin's Vee and concept mapping to organize conceptually the various subject areas, construct interviews and analyze data.    Interviews with upstate charter captains revealed a great number of concepts and propositions concerning the distribution of salmonids in Lake Ontario. These are combined with existing research knowledge to form an adult extension curriculum entitled, The Theory of Structure Fishing. Marina operators indicated a set of marina concepts and principles which they consider to be important for the success of their business. These were combined with research in The Marina Vee Analysis for the design of future marina extension events.    Governance, in the context of Educating, led this research to investigate how Sea Grant extension can design events to secure cooperation among people to achieve common goals and feedback information to guide future programming. An exemplar case of a functional Program Advisory Committee (PAC) was analyzed to determine those criteria PAC members should exhibit. Mapping techniques were used to trace lines of influence and communication in the extension program. In the broader social context, the Lake Ontario lake trout creel limit controversy was Vee analyzed to indicate the role of policy, evaluation, management and science in determining mutually agreed upon natural resource decisions. This analysis, together with interviews of Long Island captains, forms the basis for the design of extension events to help resolve natural resource conflicts.    This research indicates that a theory of educating forms an integrated and comprehensive conceptual framework for the Sea Grant Marine Advisory Service. The new educational techniques described provide agents with tools that better enable them to design and evaluate extension education programs.

T1  - CHANGING THE MEANING OF EXPERIENCE: EMPOWERING LEARNERS THROUGH THE USE OF CONCEPT MAPS, VEE DIAGRAMS, AND PRINCIPLES OF EDUCATING IN A BIOLOGY LAB COURSE
AN  - 303389797
AB  - This research involved a case study of the teaching, learning, curriculum, and governance within two sections of an introductory biology laboratory course at Cornell University during the spring semester, 1984. Concept maps, Vee diagrams, and questioning techniques were the tools used in this attempt to foster meaningful learning and the integration of thinking, feeling, and acting within the 30 students included in the study. Gowin's theory of educating, the Ausubel/Novak cognitive theory of meaningful learning, and a constructivist epistemology provided the philosophical and theoretical background upon which this investigation was built and through which the results were interpreted.    The records made of the educative events during this one semester study included copies of student concept maps and Vee diagrams, several evaluation forms and questionnaires, anecdotal notes made by the teacher/researcher, and audiotapes of students interviews. The records were summarized and transformed through an analysis of the teaching, learning, curriculum, and governance components.    The major claim of this study is that the use of concept maps, Vee diagrams, extensive teacher questioning, and a "learning-to-learn" focus within a humane and supportive environment contributed to changing the meaning of the biology lab experience for the students in this study. On the course-wide semester evaluation, these students claimed that they had learned more biology and rated the laboratory course higher than the rest of the students in the course. These students developed their skills in making concept maps and Vee diagrams throughout the semester and gave very positive evaluations of these heuristic devices.    A strategy for the improvement of educational quality is presented. Changing the meaning of educational experience can develop from a reconceptualization of the goals of educating and the four commonplaces--with a restructuring of the conceptual knowledge of what it means to teach, to learn, to create curriculum, and to govern educative events. Empowering learners means providing the tools (concept maps and Vee diagrams) and the experiences from which they can develop their own responsibility for learning meaningfully. Meaningful learning provides the basis for the integration of thinking, feeling, and acting and the potential for changing the meaning of experience.

T1  - AN AUSUBELIAN APPROACH TO INSTRUCTION: THE USE OF CONCEPT MAPS AS ADVANCE ORGANIZERS IN A JUNIOR COLLEGE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY COURSE
AN  - 303384887
AB  - This study compared two systems for organizing and presenting lecture material: the traditional method of sequencing in close accord with a textbook and an Ausubelian approach using concept maps for sequencing and as advance organizers for instruction. Subjects were students enrolled in Anatomy and Physiology classes at a Mississippi public junior college. Intact class sections were randomly assigned to control (traditional) and experimental (Ausubelian) treatments. The treatment encompassed a three-week unit covering the skeletal system, plus that time required for pretesting and posttesting.    Demographic data about the subjects were obtained using a questionnaire. A thirty-item multiple-choice content test was administered three weeks prior to the experimental unit, immediately following the experimental unit, and six weeks following the experimental unit. The Inventory of Student Perceptions of Instruction (ISPI) was administered on the same date as the immediate posttest. Data were analyzed using a variety of statistical techniques.    The experimental group exhibited marginally better performance on the immediate posttest than the control group. Experimental group scores on the delayed posttest were significantly higher than those of the control group. The experimental treatment had no great effect on ISPI scores.    This study suggests that using concept mapping strategies during instructional planning and concept maps as advance organizers during implementation of that plan is a valid tactic for improving meaningful learning and retention of conceptual material. This study also stresses the importance of delayed posttesting in advance organizer research.

T1  - THE INFLUENCE OF CONTENT ORGANIZATION AND RELEVANT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE ON THE COGNITIVE STRUCTURE AND ACHIEVEMENT OF SIXTH GRADE SCIENCE STUDENTS
AN  - 303363026
AB  - The efficacy of two instructional treatments was tested in a study involving 150 sixth graders from a large suburban school system. One treatment used an Ausubelian advance organizer and the other treatment, a content overview. After these differential pretreatments, each group was given instruction which reflected the characteristics of that group's pretreatment. The research was motivated by the conflicting reports of previous organizer studies.    Three instruments were used to assess the learning and retention of the basic geology content which was presented in both treatments. Each group was exposed to the same content for the same length of time. The only difference in the two instructional treatments was the way in which the content was organized. The pretreatments and treatments were structured differently.    The class mean scores were analyzed using analysis of covariance with IQ as the covariate. Post hoc comparisons were made with Tukey's procedure. All concept maps were scored using a quick-score technique. In addition, a small sample of the concept maps was converted into deviation matrices and analyzed using the Mann-Whitney u procedure.    The results showed that the content overview treatment was statistically more effective than the expository advance organizer treatment when both were assessed by an achievement test. Both treatments were equally effective on Bloom's Level I questions but the content overview treatment was statistically more effective on the Bloom's Level II questions. There were no statistically significant differences between the treatments when concept maps or familiarity rating scales were used as assessment instruments. Finally, there were no interactive effects between treatment and prior knowledge of the content or knowledge of the concepts included in the pretreatment.

T1  - COMPARATIVE EFFECTIVENESS OF INSTRUCTIONAL STRATEGIES ON DEVELOPING THE CHEMICAL MOLE CONCEPT
AN  - 303352677
AB  - Statement of the Problem. The purposes of this study were to determine for students enrolled in a freshman chemistry program if the type of instructional strategy used influences (1) learning of the mole concept, and (2) the level of students' misconceptions concerning selected concepts related to the mole.    Three instructional strategies derived from Piagetian and Ausubelian theories were implemented in an urban community college with freshmen chemistry students. These three strategies were the learning cycle, cognitive learning and development strategy and a lecture-laboratory strategy.    Methods and Procedures. An ex post facto, pretest-posttest, control group design was used to determine experimentally the nature of the relationship between teaching methodology to achievement level and misconception level in selected chemistry content.    Three instruments were used in the study: a math achievement test, Burney's "Piagetian Objective Formal Instrument," and the Achievement and Misconception Test (AMT). Additionally, students constructed concept maps and Gowin Vees based on laboratory and lecture materials.    The sample consisted of 60 students enrolled in the Fundamentals of Chemistry course at an urban community college during the 1983, fall semester. Two classes were taught the mole concept, over a period of five weeks, using the cognitive learning and development strategy (CLD). One class was taught the mole concept over the same period of time using the learning cycle. The third class used a lecture-laboratory format.    The data collected for this study was analyzed using a treatment by levels design where the students were matched on the basis of pretest scores. A three-way factorial analysis of variance with repeated measures was used to analyze the data.    Findings and Conclusions. The results of this study indicate that for this sample the three methods were equally as effective when used to teach various aspects of the mole concept. The results further indicate that the three methods were equally as effective in bringing about conceptual changes in which knowledge concerning mass and volume as well as the particulate nature of matter matched the knowledge structure of experts in this area.    Student reponses indicated that many students viewed matter as being continuous. Students also viewed the removal of air from a flask as leaving an empty space in the flask. Confusion concerning the difference between mass and volume was also noted.

T1  - From surprise to cognition: Some effects of the structure of C.A.L. simulation programs on the cognitive and scientific activities of young adults
AN  - 2009698461
AB  - The main objective of this thesis is to describe the effect on cognition of the structure of CAL simulation programs used, in science teaching. Four programs simulating a pond ecosystem were written so as to present a simulation model and to assist in cognition in different ways. Various clinically detailed methods of describing learning were developed and tried including concept maps which were found to be sammative rather than formative descriptions of learning, and to be ambiguous) and hierarchical structures (which were found to be difficult to produce). Fran these concept maps and hierarchical structures I developed my Interaction Model of Learning which can be used to describe the chronological events concerned with cognition. Using the Interaction Model, the nature of cognition and the effect that CAL program structure has on this process is described. Various scenarios are presented as a means of showing the possible effects of program structure on learning. Four forms of concept learning activity and their relationship to learning valid and alternative conceptions are described. The findings from the study are particularly related to the work of Driver (1983), Marton (1976) and Entwistle (1981).

T1  - THE FORMATION OF ECOLOGICAL CONCEPTS AND CONCEPTUAL SYSTEMS BY UPPER ELEMENTARY STUDENTS
AN  - 303197896
AB  - A population of SCIS students was used to investigate ecological concept formation. Two researcher designed instruments were administered:  (1) Ecosystem Test: examples, principles, definitions, and attributes of the higher-order concepts: producer, consumer, decomposer, environmental factors and their interactions via the food-mineral and oxygen-carbon dioxide cycles, (2) Ecology Card Sort: free-sort categorization task to elicit the conceptual system for ecological concepts. Statistics included analysis of variance, Spearman Correlation, multiple regression, frequency distributions, latent partition analysis. Independent variables were grade, ability, sex. Dependent variables were Ecosystem Test score, rank order of items by difficulty level, and a measure of similarity of students' and discipline experts' Ecology Card Sort pattern. Findings were:  (1) grade and ability, not sex, were related to concept attainment; (2) sequence of concept attainment was not influenced by grade, ability, sex; (3) students recognized life requirements, interactions of organisms via food, mineral, gas exchange and community groups; however, they could not articulate attributes of higher-order concepts; (4) grade and ability, not sex, influenced the similarity of the conceptual system and the discipline structure; (5) discipline experts, not elementary students, possessed conceptual systems based upon higher-order concepts; (6) formation of a conceptual system similar to discipline structure was positively related to concept attainment. Conclusions were:  (1) SCIS program was equally effective with males and females; (2) promote conceptual systems similar to discipline structure; (3) eliminate higher-order concepts: producer, consumer, decomposer, environmental factors from K-6 curriculum; (4) emphasize interaction of plants, animals, decay organisms, and non-living materials, life requirements, and feeding relationships in K-6 curriculum; (5) base concept maps upon lower-order concepts or critical attributes; (6) place more emphasis upon language development phase of SCIS Cycle. Study is significant for elementary curriculum design.

T1  - THE EFFECTS OF SPECIFIC LEARNING HEURISTICS ON THE CONCEPTUAL LEARNING OF BIOLOGY BY BLACK HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
AN  - 303180683
AB  - The major foci of the study were the conceptual learning of science concepts and principles and the improvement of biology instruction for urban, black students. The study was designed to:  (1) Assess the efficacy of two learning heuristics, concept mapping and Gowin's Epistemological Vee, to increase conceptual learning and, therefore, to increase students' immediate and retained achievement levels in high school biology; (2) Examine the effects of the learning strategies on the attitudes of urban, adolescent, black students toward science; (3) Examine possible interactions between selected personality variables and the chosen learning strategies which might affect a student's conceptual learning of biology.    The subjects were ninth and tenth grade introductory biology students in a Midwestern, urban area. A total of 10 classes were involved in this study, and subjects were divided into two experimental treatment groups by intact classes. The two treatments, concept mapping/Vee and outlining, were randomly assigned to intact classes. In addition, five comparable, introductory biology classes were used for comparison purposes. The instructional materials, developed by a research project and the investigator, consisted of four individualized, introductory biology units in a study guide format. The treatment groups used study guides which either introduced the learning strategy, concept mapping/Vee or outlining, during the experimental period. The comparison group did not use a specialized learning strategy. Comparison and treatment classes took the same pretest and posttest.    In order to assess the effectiveness of the learning strategies, a series of statistical analyses were performed. Correlation coefficients were computed between the standardized measure of school ability and selected variables and between the standardized measure of school ability and summary activity scores, expressed as percentages, for the units. The types of cognitive style and the types of instructional strategies were combined in a 2 x 2 factorial design.

T1  - A STUDY OF STUDENT UNDERSTANDING OF MENDELIAN GENETICS, USING MICROCOMPUTERS, CONCEPT MAPS, AND CLINICAL INTERVIEWS AS ANALYTICAL TOOLS
AN  - 303145490
AB  - This study examined the level of understanding in Mendelian genetics of students in introductory college biology. Of primary concern was the role of the microcomputer in identifying student conceptual frameworks and its potential for contributing to meaningful learning.    Initially, students' pre-instructional knowledge was assessed using a 37 item multiple choice test followed by an interview. The test covered vocabulary basic to Mendelian genetics, representative problems, and the process of meiosis. The interviews were used to clarify and extend answers selected on the test and to introduce a meiosis task using chromosome models.    The biology course was taught in an auto-tutorial format. As students progressed through the units on meiosis and Mendelian genetics, a sample of 20 volunteers worked genetics problems via a microcomputer laboratory simulation program. Another 20 students continued to work similar text problems in the conventional paper and pencil manner. All students from each group were interviewed as they worked problems involving one trait, two traits, sex linkage, autosomal linkage, and incomplete dominance.    After all participants had completed problem interviews, studied and passed the units (with at least an 85%), each demonstrated his understanding by producing a concept map of genetics concepts, taking the same written test again, and participating in a final interview.    As a result of the above procedures and a tabulation of the genetics questions missed on the course final, a wide variety of conceptual weaknesses, missing concepts, and misconceptions were identified. The concept maps, interview transcripts, written tests, and problem-solving strategies showed agreement in the identity of several conceptual difficulties. Several such difficulties were observed to negatively influence problem solving. Some persisted through to the end of the course.    The microcomputer laboratory program used--CATLAB--was determined to be an exceptional means of assessing conceptual frameworks and identifying problem-solving strategies.    Ausubelian learning theory was used to interpret findings from the study. The major implication is that students have not been taught in ways which promote meaningful learning. They regularly possess compartmentalized knowledge and many find it difficult to incorporate relevant concepts into a comprehensive conceptual framework. They also depend heavily on algorithms for problem-solving with little or no association with underlying principles. Recommendations for further research and suggestions of classroom strategies with these findings in mind are included.

T1  - THE EFFECTS OF ADVANCE ORGANIZERS AND SUBSUMERS ON THE UNDERSTANDING OF SOLAR ENERGY CONCEPTS BY EIGHTH GRADE STUDENTS
AN  - 303264382
AB  - David Ausubel believed the most important single factor influencing learning was what the learner already knew. New material to be learned could then be subsumed into these existing propositions in the cognitive matrix of the learner. From this theory of cognitive structure, came the idea that an organizing experience preceding the main learning activity could enhance subsequent learning. Ausubel called this organizing experience an "advance organizer". The purpose of this experimental study was to determine the effects of advance organizers and subsumers on cognitive learning of solar energy concepts by eighth grade students.    Procedure. Eleven classes of eighth grade physical science students from one middle and six junior high schools in a large, suburban school district were used in this study. The sample contained 300 students. The main learning activity was a twelve hour unit on solar energy. The advance organizers were verbal/graphic and comparative, developed according to the principles of David Ausubel and a procedural definition of advance organizer as defined in the study. The techniques of modified clinical interviews and concept-mapping were also used in constructing the advance organizers. Another type of introductory material, a factual summary, was used for one of the controls; the other control groups were advance organizer/no unit of instruction and no organizer. The experimental design was a pre-test, post-test, experimental/control group. The students' post-test scores on the investigator-developed "Solar Energy Concepts Survey" served as the dependent variable. The independent variables were subsumer level, gender, and retention of learning. Analysis of variance techniques and the Scheffe test were used to analyze the data.    Findings and Conclusions. Within the framework of this study, the findings indicated:  (1) Advance organizers benefited students of all subsumer levels on cognitive learning of solar energy concepts on both immediate and delayed tests. (2) The presence of relevant subsumers in cognitive matrix benefited students on both immediate and delayed tests.    It was recommended that further studies be conducted on the effects of advance organizers that incorporate the procedural definition advocated in this study and the relationship between subsumers and the new information in instruction.

T1  - STUDIES IN CELL STRUCTURE AND BEHAVIOR
AN  - 303254009
AB  - This dissertation is concerned with studies of cell structure. Part I reports on cellular behavior and flagellar involvement during cellular adhesion, while Part II presents studies of concepts of cell structure.    The Euglenoid flagellate, Colacium libellae, exhibits a docking sequence which consists of an approach, spiral behavior, pellicular contact with the substrate, flagellar resorption, and stalk extrusion. This pattern of behavior occurs during the transition of the organism from a free-swimming flagellate to the non-flagellated attached cell. A microvideographic analysis of flagellar involvement has been performed, including an analysis of the components of flagellar movement. Data gathered during this research indicate the possibility of two independent molecular mechanisms for providing flagellar motion. Flagellar resorption is linear with time and culture age does not appear to affect the rate of resorption.    Cell structure concepts are approached in the second component of this study. Concepts are the immediate objects of thought. This study of concept acquisition is concerned with how students assimilate and incorporate concepts of cell structure, and with changes in conceptualization through controlled instruction. Concept analysis, concept mapping, and concept transitions are utilized to follow the development of clear and stable concepts in the student's cognitive structure. Conceptual error categorization is presented within to monitor conceptual transitions. A cell structure concept hierarchy is considered. The cell structure concepts under study are grouped into pairs of close-in coordinate concepts based upon response frequencies and overlap of structural and functional attributes. The technique of conceptual error categorization allows for following patterns of change in conceptualization, and is of value in that it enables the researcher to monitor either group or individual data for each concept. The procedures incorporated in Part II will allow for more effective instructional design.

T1  - USE OF GOWIN'S VEE AND CONCEPT MAPPING STRATEGIES TO TEACH STUDENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEARNING IN HIGH SCHOOL BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES
AN  - 303066371
AB  - Concept mapping (CM) and Gowin's Vee (V) mapping strategies were used with two high school freshmen biology classes for two semesters. A quasi experimental case study design was used because all variables could not be controlled in a field situation. The effect of these instructional strategies was assessed in terms of test performance, attitude change, laboratory understanding, anecdotal records, and clinical interviews. The experimental group received CM and Vee strategies and two comparison classes received traditional instructional strategies of textbook questions and laboratory manual questions (TQ/LQ).    Taped clinical interviews revealed that CM/V students thought the CM/V strategies were 'hard work'. They also indicated that students recognized and valued understanding vs. rote learning whereas TQ/LQ students did not make this distinction. Vee instructed students demonstrated an understanding that interrelationships existed between theory and method, ideas and observations, and cognitively connected laboratory activities to text information and class discussions. Students in comparison classes did not state these interrelationships in particular essay test items and in oral responses to an independent laboratory observer. Objective test performance between the two groups was not significantly different, but quality of essay answers was markedly better in the CM/V students.    Attitude toward biology was different between the two groups in their interviews. Although the CM/V students did not like to work hard, as CMs and Vees demanded, they did comment that biology really made sense for them. Some students were seen to have fear of new strategies. Based on the results of the interviews, a link between learning theory and teaching can be made by CM/V strategies.    Junior animal behavior students and students in science fair research were seen to use Vees to clarify their understanding of original journal research papers and to represent their own research to judges at science fairs in lieu of the abstract.    This research can be translated into practice. There is a need to help people learn about science concepts, facts, and events. CM/V strategies should be performed by students within 2-4 different disciplines per their school day, over 2-3 years for a more realistic assessment of the effects of "learning to learn" strategies on attitudes, achievement and performance.

T1  - ADAPTATION OF INTERPERSONAL PROCESS RECALL AND A THEORY OF EDUCATING FOR THE CONCEPTUALIZATION OF COLLEGE INSTRUCTION
AN  - 303013502
AB  - An adapted form of Interpersonal Process Recall (Kagan, N.) was used to create a safe atmosphere where twenty-two teaching assistants and some of their students in an introductory biology laboratory course could use videotapes of laboratory teaching episodes to stimulate the recalling and sharing of valuable thoughts and feelings experienced while those teaching episodes were occurring. The audiotaped recordings of expressions of feelings and thoughts were used to support a theory of educating (Gowin) which focuses on the integration of thinking, feeling and acting as a desirable aim of educating. The adaptation of the recall process resulted in the reconceptualization of the role of "inquirer" to help the TAs develop concepts and principles of teaching. Training in teaching techniques using concept maps, advance organizers and the solicitation for student feedback of shared meaning was provided.    In addition to the audio and videotapes, forms and questionnaires were collected on teaching plans, self-ratings of instruction, student ratings of instruction and training evaluation. These facts provide evidence to support the use of the teaching techniques included in the training and to support claims that the adapted recall method can be used to help TAs develop concepts of teaching.    Initially, the study had to determine whether videotapes of college teaching could serve to stimulate the recalling of thoughts and feelings experienced by teachers and students in sufficient detail that they could be expressed in reasonably resolved form. The adapted recall process proved to be quite effective in helping make explicit the covert events of classroom interaction such as thoughts and feelings.    Both as a method for studying teaching and for helping teachers improve their instruction the role of recall inquirer had to be modified somewhat to encourage a focusing on the more valuable and critical thoughts and feelings experienced by both teachers and students. These modifications were made on the basis of a theory of educating which defines teaching as the achievement of shared meaning and which suggests that a concentration of identifying regularities in teaching events is a means of conceptualizing teaching. The exchange of thoughts and feelings recalled by teachers and students provided a feedback loop whereby the recallers could come to change their minds about the meaning of educative events. The most effective form of feedback was determined to be immediate, detailed and event-referenced. Subsequent teaching events were morel liable to be governed in accordance with the newly identified concepts and principles of teaching which evolved from the recall discussion. By verbalizing the regularities of teaching processes which were previously vague the TAs' conceptualization of their teaching provided them with a broader basis for deciding how to govern teaching outcomes and thus increase the precision with which teaching events are made to happen.    The adapted videotape recall technique indicated to the TAs the specific application and utility of the use of concept maps, advance organizers and solicitation for student feedback. The use of solicitations by TAs and students was a primary vehicle through which meaningful feedback was exchanged. The use of advance organizers fulfilled some of the specific psychological needs students had at the beginning of classes. The use of concept maps provided an overall conceptual framework to which laboratory events could be related and integrated.    The implications of this study suggest that the adapted videotape recall process is a reliable method for studying teaching and has great potential for the study of learning. Additional research is indicated which could analyze in more detail the process of sharing meaning and the reciprocal nature of the roles of teachers and students.
