AB  - We discuss the perceptions and experiences of high school students using reflective writing and labatorials to at-tempt to understand Newtonian concepts of force and motion. The sequencing and content of these activities are cen-tered on targeting students’ key difficulties related to forces and motion. Participants are 210 secondary 5 (grade 11) students, from three private schools in Montreal, who took a physics course during 2017–2018 or 2018–2019. Their ideas and opinions about forces and learning physics were investigated prior to and following the study with (a) three questions from the Force Concept Inventory; (b) a concept map focused on the relations between force and motion, and (c) pre-and post-semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 participants. The gathered data and interviews indi-cate that the process of combining labatorials with reflective writing improves students’ attitudes towards learning the subject. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - A Human-Prosthetic Interface (HPI) serves to estimate and realise the limb pose intended by the human user, using the information obtained from sensors worn by the user. In recent studies, the HPI maps multi-joint limb poses (i.e. coordinated movement of the body and limbs) to the inputs of multiple sensors. This is in contrast to the conventional methods where each degree of freedom of the powered prosthesis is mapped to the input of one/a pair of sensors. In this approach, it is necessary to systematically select sensors that carry the most information for the intended set of poses, to improve system accuracy and/or minimise the number of sensors, thus the complexity, in the prosthetic system. In this paper, sensor selection process is systematically formulated to maximise the information contained in the input features for a given number of sensors. Most importantly, it accounts for composite features, which are features requiring information from multiple sensors. Such composite features exist and are important in HPIs as we seek to capture coordinated motion involving movements of multiple limb and body segments. A non-convex optimisation problem is formulated which accounts for the constraint introduced by the composite features. A projection matrix is utilised as the optimisation variable to select intended features for evaluation. The problem is solved by the proposed Sensor Selection with Composite Features (SS-CF) algorithm which adapts convex-relaxation techniques. The SS-CF is benchmarked against HPI with expert-selected sensors in the literature and against a greedy heuristic method. The outcome demonstrated the efficacy of the SS-CF algorithm.  © 2001-2011 IEEE.

AB  - A mini review of attitudes and beliefs toward physics has been carried out. The purpose of this study was to address aspects that influence attitudes and beliefs toward physics and various learning models that can increase attitudes and beliefs toward physics. The method used in this study was literature review. Literature review was done by searching for keywords, i.e.: attitudes towards physics and beliefs towards physics. This keyword search was done through Google Scholar, Base, and Core search engines. We have obtained 25 articles that matched the keywords and have been screened with the limitation of the year of publication, namely the last 10 years. Through this literature review it can be obtained that physics attitudes and beliefs were influenced by gender and personality, grade level, type of school, and age. Contradictions regarding aspects that influence attitudes and beliefs about physics occur in the gender aspect. Various learning methods to improve attitudes and beliefs about physics were cooperative learning models with jigsaw, Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), concept maps, peer instruction methods, open inquiry methods, learning integrated with music, and learning using a computer simulation model. © 2023 Sociedad Mexicana de Fisica.

AB  - Engineering education needs to be flexible with the changing technology, and it must blend traditional and new teaching pedagogy for the overall knowledge creation in the students. A survey of prevalent experiential learning methods has shown tremendous potential to improve engineering students' learning. However, existing experiential learning methods are hard to integrate with current teaching-learning process at Amity University, Uttar Pradesh, Lucknow Campus, India. A pilot study conducted during Power plant Instrumentation taught in the seventh semester of the Electrical and Electronics undergraduate program balances the current teaching method with the proposed Trajectory -driven pedagogy as an alternative teaching pedagogy. A trajectory driven computerized adaptive assessment procedure for teaching has been proposed in this paper. The system follows a trajectory of courses to generate the subsequent questions from the vast database of questions. A sequence of questions is guided by Concept Map which represents the questions from three courses in a hierarchical manner. Analysis of students' assessments shows that the proposed methodology could is accurate for quantitative measurement of the course learning outcomes in a summative assessment. © 2022 International Journal on Recent and Innovation Trends in Computing and Communication.

AB  - This study was done to explore Group Concept Mapping (GCM) as a method to reach consensus for data collection using document analysis in an S-STEM research team. The team was comprised of five members and the GCM approach was made up of six steps: (1) Preparation, (2) Generation, (3) Structuring, (4) Analysis, (5) Interpretation, and (6) Usage. The members of the team were asked to identify and rank any documents they thought could be useful as it pertained to each of the three research questions. Forty-five unique statements were generated and point plots and cluster shape charts were created for each research question to visualize which documents ranked highest for each one. After analyzing the data five key documents were identified to be useful for all three research questions. These five were: documentation regarding partner programs, transfer guides, websites on transfer at the four-year institution, shared agreements for sharing curriculum, and articulation agreements for the S-STEM program. This process proves to be useful for documentation identification and theming within data sets as it pertains to groups and team settings. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Introduction.Health informatics curricular content, while beneficial to the spectrum of education in physical therapy, is currently only required in physical therapist education programs, and even there, it is only crudely defined. The purpose of our study was to use the techniques of concept analysis and concept mapping to provide an outline of informatics content that can be the foundation for curriculum development and the construction of informatics competencies for physical therapy.Review of Literature.There is no established consensus on the definition of health informatics. Medical and nursing informatics literature that clarifies and agrees on the attributes of health informatics is insufficient for curriculum development. Concept analysis is an approach commonly used in nursing and other health professions to analyze and deconstruct a term, in this case, health informatics, in order to provide clarity on its meaning.Subjects.A total of 73 definitions of health informatics were extracted from articles that met search criteria.Methods.We used an 8-step methodology from the literature for concept analysis, which included 1) selecting a concept; 2) determining the aims of the analysis; 3) identifying uses of the concept; 4) determining the defining attributes of the concept; 5) identifying a model case; 6) identifying related and illegitimate cases; 7) identifying antecedents and consequences; and 8) defining empirical referents. In addition, concept mapping was used to develop a visual representation of the thematic attributes and the elements that make them up.Results.We provide a visual map of the concept we now term "informatics in human health and health care"and clarify its attributes of data, disciplinary lens, multidisciplinary science, technology, and application. We also provide clarification through the presentation of a model case and a contrary case.Discussion and Conclusion.Concept analysis and mapping of informatics in human health and health care provided clarity on content that should be addressed across the continuum of physical therapy education. The next steps from this work will be to develop competencies for all levels of physical therapy education.  © Copyright 2022 Academy of Physical Therapy Education, APTA Unauthorized reproduction of this article is prohibited.

AB  - Self-directed learning in an appropriately designed environment can help learners retain knowledge tied to experience and motivate them to learn more. For teachers, however, it is difficult to design an environment to give to learners and to give feedback that reflects respect for their independent efforts, while for learners, it is difficult to set learning objectives on their own and to construct knowledge correctly based on their own efforts. In this research, we developed a learning support system that provides a mechanism for constructing an observational learning environment using virtual space and that encourages self-directed knowledge discovery. We confirmed that this system contributes to a learner's structural understanding and its retention and to a greater desire to learn at a level comparable to that of concept map creation, another active learning method.  © 2023 The Institute of Electronics.

AB  - Online learning has become an essential part of mainstream higher education. With increasing enrollments in online anatomy courses, a better understanding of effective teaching techniques for the online learning environment is critical. Active learning has previously shown many benefits in face-to-face anatomy courses, including increases in student satisfaction. Currently, no research has measured student satisfaction with active learning techniques implemented in an online graduate anatomy course. This study compares student satisfaction across four different active learning techniques (jigsaw, team-learning module, concept mapping, and question constructing), with consideration of demographics and previous enrollment in anatomy and/or online courses. Survey questions consisted of Likert-style, multiple-choice, ranking, and open-ended questions that asked students to indicate their level of satisfaction with the active learning techniques. One hundred seventy Medical Science master's students completed the online anatomy course and all seven surveys. Results showed that students were significantly more satisfied with question constructing and jigsaw than with concept mapping and team-learning module. Additionally, historically excluded groups (underrepresented racial minorities) were generally more satisfied with active learning than non-minority groups. Age, gender, and previous experience with anatomy did not influence the level of satisfaction. However, students with a higher-grade point average (GPA), those with only a bachelor's degree, and those with no previous online course experience were more satisfied with active learning than students who had a lower GPA, those holding a graduate/professional degree, and those with previous online course experience. Cumulatively, these findings support the beneficial use of active learning in online anatomy courses. © 2023 American Association for Anatomy.

AB  - This chapter begins by briefly reviewing the theory and relevant literature on formative assessment and then describes examples of several methods that can be used to provide useful feedback for program improvement. Efforts are now under way to develop concept inventories in engineering that will drive change in engineering education in the way that the Force Concept Inventory has driven change in physics instruction. Reflective journals incorporating periodic probes and checks can be used effectively for program formative assessment. Portfolios, which have long been employed in fields such as writing, architecture, and the arts, have more recently been used for outcomes assessment in engineering, especially electronic portfolios, or e-portfolios. Portfolios are usually evaluated using scoring rubrics to provide formative feedback for program improvement. Scoring rubrics have been used for a broad range of subjects and are usually employed when a judgment of quality is required. Concept maps are being used for assessment in many science and engineering programs. © 2008 Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Numerous studies have proven the learning benefits of concept maps in science subjects, particularly for students with low prior knowledge. There is a scarcity of research dedicated to the examination of chemistry courses at the university level, and the findings pertaining to academic performance in that subject exhibit a lack of consistency. This study examined the impact of concept maps on students of a General Chemistry course who had low prior knowledge. The study applied a quasi-experimental design to collect data on two topics: uncertainties of measurements (Topic 1) and acid-base (Topic 2). Fill-in-the-nodes concept maps were developed and served as learning materials. ANCOVA and Johnson-Neyman techniques were used to analyze the scores of concept tests of Topic 1 and Topic 2, respectively. In both Topics 1 and 2, the results showed that the treatment group outperformed the control group. However, the aforementioned finding was limited to the subset of students whose pre-test scores were below 30.7 out of a total of 47. From the analysis of the attitude questionnaire, the authors concluded that the students appreciated the usefulness of concept maps. However, they might hesitate to engage in using this new learning tool. The study's findings strengthen the evidence of the learning benefits of concept mapping. Moreover, using concept maps in teaching is feasible because of their low cost and minimally invasive modification to instructional design. The practices for implication of concept mapping are also discussed. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Learning to program requires diligent practice and creates room for discovery, trial and error, debugging, and concept mapping. Learners must walk this long road themselves, supported by appropriate and timely feedback. Providing such feedback in programming exercises is not a humanly feasible task. Therefore, the early and steadily growing interest of computer science educators in the automated assessment of programming exercises is not surprising. The automated assessment of programming assignments has been an active area of research for over a century, and interest in it continues to grow as it adapts to new developments in computer science and the resulting changes in educational requirements. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the work that has been performed, who has performed it, its evolution over time, the relationships between publications, its hot topics, and open problems, among others. This paper presents a bibliometric study of the field, with a particular focus on the issue of automatic feedback generation, using literature data from the Web of Science Core Collection. It includes a descriptive analysis using various bibliometric measures and data visualizations on authors, affiliations, citations, and topics. In addition, we performed a complementary analysis focusing only on the subset of publications on the specific topic of automatic feedback generation. The results are highlighted and discussed. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Electrochemistry, a key topic in introductory chemistry, is a topic that many students struggle with conceptually. Visual learning tools like concept maps allow the externalization of key concepts and the relationships between these concepts may aid in students' acquisition and retention of newly learned electrochemistry concepts. Partnering with a general chemistry instructor, this study explored the effectiveness of two concept map formats—fill-in-the-concepts and student-corrected maps, on electrochemistry outcomes with undergraduate general chemistry students. To examine students' engagement with these maps, we also explored the role of students' interest. Results indicated that prior knowledge and map condition were significant predictors of students' electrochemistry performance. Specifically, the fill-in-the-concepts condition resulted in better learning outcomes than the map correction condition. Furthermore, students with a higher interest in electrochemistry were more likely to perform well on their respective concept mapping activities, thus, scoring higher on the posttest. These findings suggested that concept maps can effectively represent key concepts of a challenging topic, and are beneficial for students' learning and retention of information. Importantly, instructors may further support learning by providing scaffolds in the form of fill-in-the-concept maps to help students better organize their mental structures and identify misconceptions. © 2023 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - Background: Behavior is known as misconduct when individuals do not adhere to ethical standards, rules, or regulations. Several factors lead to misconduct, including the lack of understanding of what misconduct is among undergraduate students. However, misconduct as a concept needs more clarity and specificity. Objective: This study aimed to examine the concept of misconduct from the literature and establish an operational definition for application to nursing education. Research design: A concept analysis using Rodger’s evolutionary view was used to analyze the literature from the disciplines of: academics, business, law, and religious perspectives. Findings and discussion: An operational definition was developed based on the multidisciplinary concept analysis. A concept map was designed to help visualize the antecedents, attributes, and consequences and to assist in the conceptualization of misconduct. Implications for nursing science, administration, and education are provided. Conclusion: Understanding misconduct is necessary for nurse educators to ensure ethical practice within the academic context. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe the possibilities of using worksheets in the teaching of lipids and proteins. The worksheet includes a concept map, suggestions for three safe experiments that can be performed with available household chemicals, and observation results. The worksheets were implemented into action research in two classes taught by the same teacher. The verification of the worksheets took 90 min. First, the students filled out the prediction cards, structured the concepts related to the topic of the worksheet, verified the worksheet, wrote the results of the verification, and finally, after performing the experiments, filled in the prediction cards again. It was found that students have a problem with the interpretation of the data and many of them lack the skills needed to carry out the experiment. The knowledge at the beginning and at the end of the lesson was verified by deciding on the truth of the statements on the prediction card. For lipids, students’ input knowledge was 57% and output knowledge was 81%, while for proteins, students’ input knowledge was 66% and output knowledge was 91%. The combination of work with a conceptual map and the implementation of experiments led to the consolidation of knowledge in these two thematic units of biochemistry. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the field of knowledge surrounding Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) curricula with a view to filling a gap in ESD literature by identifying features that may help ESD course designers. The study asks the questions: what is taught in ESD courses in higher education? and what content do students say they like? Working within the constructivist tradition, this study involved two groups of participants: 13 ESD design/delivery participants from six universities based in five countries (Group One) and 737 ESD students (Group Two) from three of those universities. The overarching methodology of comparative analysis was used to address the research questions. Data collection included course learning materials, participant questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and feedback on teaching. Group One data was analysed using comparative/descriptive analysis and reflexive thematic analysis was used for Group Two data. The methods were complementary to de/reconstruct data for comparability of features. NVivo software was employed to acquire results which are presented visually using tables and concept maps. The study identifies common content taught in stand-alone ESD courses and makes recommendations for course modelling based on Group One data contributions and what content Group Two say they like. The recommendations are presented as seven categories of consolidated curricular themes including science and sustainability based, contextually relevant, and futures hope. Consideration is given to student internal/external motivational domains and possible connection to curricular themes. Recommendations are practical and flexible, not prescriptive. The original contribution to knowledge lies in suggestions for ESD course content. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The evolution of concept mapping has benefitted from the robust theoretical basis provided by Ausubelian learning theory. However, for concept mapping to maintain its relevance and to keep pace with the evolutionary changes in the educational context, it is vital that educational researchers and classroom practitioners can augment this theoretical base with contemporary learning theories that will help to improve the application of concept mapping and increase the likelihood that the goal of meaningful learning will be achieved in practice. This involves shifting the focus of concept mapping from product to process and the role of the learner from 'being' to 'becoming.' The act of concept mapping needs to be viewed as a way of mastering learning rather than of mastering specific content. We propose the consideration of the explicit role of semantic waves as an improvement from simplistic knowledge representation towards the development of more complex knowledge modelling as a way of developing powerful knowledge structures. © 2023 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

AB  - Introduction: Concept mapping is a multidimensional tool that has been put to little use in India. We designed this study to check its applicability for assessing higher-order thinking in the subject of Physiology. Methods: This interventional analytical study was carried out among 65 students of Phase I of MBBS in the year 2021. The students were sensitized to the technique and were given a practice session. On a pre-informed date, an assessment of a topic taught to them was done using concept mapping and a multiple-choice question (MCQ) based test. Feedback on the technique was taken from the students. The statistical tests used were test of normality – Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, significance of association-Wilcoxon Signed Rank test, correlation-Spearman’s correlation, and agreement-Bland Altman Analysis. The discrimination index was calculated for both concept mapping and MCQ based tests, separately. Percentages were calculated for feedback questionnaire items. The data were analysed using Microsoft Excel (2019) and an online calculator. P values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: Students scored more in concept mapping. There was a significant difference in the scores of the students on the two tests (Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test, Z=-2.66, P=0.008) and a weakly positive non-significant correlation between them (Spearman’s correlation coefficient, rs =0.07, P=0.60). Bland Altman’s Analysis showed agreement in the scores of the students in the two tests. The mean score of the students in the two tests increased, so did the difference in the scores in the two tests. The discrimination index of concept mapping (0.28) was higher than that of the MCQ-based test (0.18). Most of the students agreed on the advantages of concept mapping in the feedback. Conclusion: The assessment result of concept mapping is better than that of MCQ-based test and it may be included as a teaching-learning and assessment strategy in the context of Indian medical education in the subject of Physiology. © Journal of Advances in Medical Education & Professionalism.

AB  - With the development of science and technology, the demand for programmers has increased. However, learning computer programs is not an easy task. It might cause a significant impact on programming if misconceptions exist at the beginning of the study. Hence, it is important to discover and correct them immediately. Chatbots are effective teaching aids, they can assist students in eliminating misconceptions. They also assist teachers to instruct students according to their aptitude, which teachers found it hard to accomplish without technical supports when teaching in large classes. Therefore, this experiment uses chatbots to assist learners in the correction phase. We consider that learners who failed unit quizzes might have misunderstandings in programming concepts. We believe chatbots can teach according to individual misunderstandings and give correct responses to their unclear concepts. It is more effective than traditional teaching methods. In addition, to prevent human-computer interaction barriers, such as picking wrong keywords and giving plausible replies, or learners not being able to express their problems clearly, this experiment also adds concept maps to the chatbots’ dialogue, to work as the dialogue structure for each chatbot. The maps help the chatbots to explain concepts in each unit systematically and logically. The chatbots give questions according to the concepts on the concept maps and ask learners to reply with their answers. An ANCOVA test investigated students’ scores. Result showed the p-value is below 0.001, indicating that the group using concept map chatbots has better correction effects than the other group using only concept maps. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degrees represent a future employment scenario with low unemployment rates due to the high demand for qualified personnel. However, the STEM sector also represents an educational field marked by horizontal segregation and the gender gap. Different factors play a role in deciding which higher education studies to pursue. From a theoretical and empirical approach, this study aims to identify which factors are associated with the gender gap in the STEM higher education sector. Furthermore, as a research question, it is proposed: are the factors identified at a theoretical and empirical level associated with the gender gap in the STEM higher education sector the same? The empirically validated questionnaire “Questionnaire with university students on STEM studies in Higher Education” (QSTEMHE) was applied to the student community of public and private universities in Spain in 2021, using simple random probability sampling to answer the research question and objective. A final sample of 2101 participants of different genders belonging to different branches of knowledge was obtained. The data analysis was carried out using qualitative methodology and the phenomenological method, following different stages. Firstly, a theoretical conceptual map of the main factors identified in the literature and their authors was composed. Secondly, an empirical conceptual map has been designed with the factors identified in the narratives of the study participants. Finally, these maps were complemented with a SWOT analysis based on the participants' discourses. As a result, it has been observed that there are extrinsic and intrinsic factors and that social constructs and gender stereotypes strongly influence the perception of men, women, and professions and the masculinisation and feminisation of these. Outreach interventions should be proposed from the institutional educational spheres to alleviate existing biases about studies and professions. © 2023

AB  - This study aims to equip students with conceptual modeling skills to address compelling 21st-century challenges in chemistry and chemical engineering education. System-based concept mapping is a critical competence for analyzing global, often complex, problems. We examined how conceptual modeling could scaffold practical experimental design, transitioning from problem identification to testable hypotheses. We set up a project in which first-year undergraduates in chemical engineering work in groups of 5-6 students. Their task was to develop concrete hypotheses for assignments that center on finding sustainable solutions for polluted environments. A set of educational roles (i.e., lecturers, tutors, learning assistants, educational specialist, and project coordinator) were implemented to ensure that students could accomplish their main learning outcome; that is, to become familiar with the academic way of thinking and apply critical thinking skills as a team. Interviews were conducted after the project was finished and revealed that, while conceptual modeling helped students to structure their ideas (i.e., to learn how to design research questions, incorporate interventions, and test models), developing hypotheses remains a challenging task. Our findings brought us to the recommendations for teaching conceptual modeling in the curriculum rather than at the project level, allowing students to progressively transition from understanding and applying concept mapping in their first year into creating solutions within the context of solving complex real-world problems in the final year of their bachelor’s degree. The collaborative learning environment and project format employed in this work could spark new ways to teach science that facilitates systems thinking in chemistry. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - Background: The goal of this research was to determine students’ perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students’ developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students’ perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results: Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students’ perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students’ science learning. Conclusions: Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students’ learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students’ perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - The theory of evolution can be a useful basis for developing students’ understanding of ecology. Our study used concept maps to examine the development of sixth-grade students’ understanding of the Antarctic ecosystem following several evolution ‘Science Days’ conducted at ‘Nature Campus’–an informal learning environment comprised of a natural history museum, zoological and botanical gardens. The programme included physical experiences, such as observations and measurements of fossils, skeletons and mounted specimens, and observations in the zoological and botanical gardens. After the first and fourth days, the students watched the film ‘March of the Penguins,’ and were asked to draw concept maps depicting the penguins’ lives. These maps were then analysed to assess: (a) the changes in the students’ depictions of the ecosystem’s complexity, and (b) the manner and extent to which they used ideas and concepts in evolution to explain phenomena in the Antarctic ecosystem. We found that the students’ concept maps increased in complexity, and their post-maps incorporated concepts in evolution from their experiences at Nature Campus. Our results therefore emphasise the benefits of fundamentally changing how biology education is divided and defined, and transitioning to a more holistic approach that acknowledges the interdisciplinary nature of biological phenomena. © 2021 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - Background: Chronic pain and pain catastrophization are growing problems across the United States, within the Hispanic-American population. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) changes pain knowledge and beliefs in many populations, but its impact on reconceptualization in people of Hispanic-American origin is unknown. Purpose: Explore the changes in pain knowledge in Hispanic-American individuals and the process involved in reconceptualization following a PNE lecture. Methods: Eight Hispanic-American adults participated in a mixed-methods exploratory study. The Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire (R-NPQ) was completed before, immediately after, and eight months after an adapted PNE lecture. A focus group involving four participants discussed the impact of PNE. Transcripts were translated and theme coded, and a concept map was developed by consensus. Results: R-NPQ scores improved from 25.3% to 43.5% post-lecture, and the number of unsure responses decreased from 41.5% to 18.4%. At eight months, R-NPQ scores remained stable (44.2%) but unsure responses increased (28.9%). Themes that contributed to the process of change included cognitive dissonance, relevance of instruction, idea exchange through peer interaction, reflection, confidence, changed behaviors, and educational utility. Conclusion: While small improvements in knowledge and perception of pain appeared to occur with the PNE, knowledge remained low. Consideration of adult learning principles such as applicability, peer-interaction, the confrontation of beliefs, and reflection throughout PNE may enhance its impact. Future investigation should explore the efficacy of this intervention, when compared or combined with other techniques in the treatment of Hispanic-Americans experiencing persistent pain. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Teacher questions are one of the crucial components in developing students’ concept maps in project-based learning (PjBL). The study aims to measure the quality of students’ concept maps and determine the PjBL stages that accommodate concept map quality using an expanded teacher question. This research was a quasi-experiment with 335 students as participants from five senior high schools. To collect the data, teachers used open questions during the PjBL learning process with three categories: main, standard, and expanded teacher questions. The concept map data were collected from students of Biology. The student’s concept map score is calculated based on the achievement of the experts’ Concept map. Data were analyzed using Manova. The results showed that teacher questions in the PjBL stage increased the concept map component scores, especially in valid relationships and crosslink, while other components increased, no effect, and decreased. The most influential PjBL stage that accommodates concept map quality improvement is the deciding stage. Hence, our findings supported that the deciding stage of PjBL is the primary stage to improve the quality of students’ thinking. The expanded teacher’s questions in the study group, the way of collecting data, and the data analysis significantly contributed to the improvement in the quality of students’ thinking. © 2023, Springer.

AB  - The Dynamic and Interactive Mathematical Expressions (DIME) Map system automatically generates DIME maps, which are personalizable and manipulable concept maps that allow students to interact with the mathematical concepts contained in any portable document format (PDF) textbook or document. A teacher can automatically upload a PDF textbook chapter and retrieve a DIME map of the contained mathematically based concepts. The DIME map is interactive and manipulable and can be used to interactively navigate the PDF textbook chapter. Our goal was to investigate the relationship between use of DIME maps and student learning outcomes, including self-efficacy and ability to understand and recall connections between physics concepts. We implemented a pretest/posttest to determine if student self-efficacy and connections in knowledge increased after participation in a summer camp physics class. We additionally conducted student interviews to better understand how changes in these two factors may have occurred. We then used multivariate analysis of variance and thematic analysis, finding and investigating positive effects of students using DIME maps, namely growth in self-efficacy and connections in knowledge. Based on our findings, we conclude that DIME maps can be valuable learning tools for students that have positive effects on both cognitive and affective learning outcomes. © The Authors.

AB  - In comparison with traditional lectures, active learning methods have the potential to foster learner agency and consequently raise academic performance. However, these methods are often applied with little knowledge about their effectiveness. In this study, we introduced two concept maps in an undergraduate cell biology course, to investigate their effect on student performance, but also mental health, in a quasi-experimental setup. By implementing group tasks into the work, we aimed to reduce feelings of loneliness among the participants, a common phenomenon among students in the study country. We evaluated the effects of the concept maps via exam grades and in an anonymous student survey. Here, we found no increase in student performance after introduction of the active learning task. Students also did not report improvements in their feelings of loneliness. We conclude that this active learning method did not detectably improve student performance or mental health, a result which does not conform to the popular perception of positive effects from active learning. The survey revealed that students do not have a preference for either active learning or traditional lectures, however, the students experienced that the concept map helped them to describe, explain and hypothesize about the topics. Overall, this shows that the concept map method is a valid alternative to traditional lectures, since students perform equally between both learning approaches. © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Collaborative knowledge construction (CKC) involved students’ sharing of information, improvement of ideas, and construction of collective knowledge. In this process, knowledge extraction and analysis can provide valuable insights into students’ knowledge capacities, depths, and levels in order to improve the CKC quality. However, existing studies tended to extract and analyze knowledge from a single perspective (e.g., the number of certain knowledge types and knowledge structures), which failed to demonstrate the complexity and dynamics of knowledge construction and advancement. To fill this gap, this research designed a series of computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) activities to facilitate students’ CKC process and then used an integrated approach (i.e., semantic knowledge analysis combined with learning analytics) to extract, analyze, and understand students’ knowledge characteristics and evolutionary trends. Results demonstrated that compared to the low-performing pairs, the high-performing pairs mainly discussed knowledge related to the course content, and their knowledge evolution trend was relatively stable. Based on the results, this research provided analytical implications to extract, analyze, and understand students’ knowledge and pedagogical implications to promote students’ knowledge construction and advancement. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Forest reserves are spaces of conservation and are often spaces of ecotourism as well. Evidence suggests that local community participation in the conservation of the forest reserve space tends to break down under weak ecotourism sector management. The Bossou Forest Reserve (BFR) in Guinea, West Africa has deteriorated considerably due to the fragmentation of the reserve and the inexorable decline in Bossou chimpanzee populations since the 1970s. The situation is largely attributable to several complex and interrelated factors, including the lack of established processes to support meaningful community participation in conservation and ecotourism planning. Ecotourism planning, with the participation of local communities, is considered to strengthen the management of the BFR and conservation connectivity. This paper reports on an approach to sustainable ecotourism planning of the BFR using the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) framework to determine the drivers of change and livelihood concerns. Fieldwork undertook in 2019 entailed concept mapping activities which were followed by a participatory geographic information system (PGIS) approach to support community-scale ecotourism planning that considers the multiple needs of stakeholders. Data analysis resulted in a community-centered situational assessment and classification of opportunities, both of which inform ecotourism planning and social-ecological resilience. The study provides baseline data for developing a robust ecotourism management plan capable of coping with the changing internal and external stressors. PGIS-based ecotourism planning can support community priorities and is potentially applicable to other West African areas with similar ecological and livelihood settings. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: To develop a foundation of scientific understanding, undergraduate biology students need to integrate ideas about individual concepts into thinking about complex biological systems. Methods: To investigate the extent to which undergraduate students engage in systems thinking, we conducted a pre-post study with students in a required undergraduate botany course at a small liberal arts college in the Midwest. All students in the study completed a causal map at the beginning and end of the course. Casual maps are similar to concept maps but demonstrate cause and effect relationships rather than other connections included in a concept map. Results: Analysis showed that the majority of students did see some connections within the system but did not reach a high level of systems thinking. Discussion: This work highlights the difficulties undergraduate students have with engaging in systems thinking but provides important insight into the particular areas in which students do engage in more complex thinking and areas in which we can specifically target with instruction and intervention.

AB  - Although previous studies have confirmed the various benefits of concept maps, limited information is available regarding how to effectively employ the concept map in online courses. In this research, we have designed and assessed the effectiveness of the “Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map” model in an online biology course. The model has optimized the concept map project because it incorporates synchronous interaction as well as asynchronous communication among students, assigns required meetings with flexible schedules, endows students with intrinsic motivation, and is facilitated by indirect instructor intervention. Our results showed improved student skills in constructing the cross-chapter concept map and positive student perceptions of the model. In addition, this study provided an in-depth analysis of how students benefit from cross-chapter concept maps. Our findings could guide educators on how to optimize the concept map project and utilize concept maps effectively to overcome some primary learning challenges and enhance student learning in online education, especially in STEM fields. NEW & NOTEWORTHY This research aims to optimize the concept map project for STEM courses in the virtual delivery system and to explore its effectiveness. Specifically, we 1) established the “Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map” model in an online STEM course; 2) evaluated student performance on concept map construction; 3) distributed survey questions to investigate student perception toward the Zoom-sandwiched cross-chapter concept map model; and 4) further explored the mechanism of how this model promoted student learning © Copyright 2023 the American Physiological Society

AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how pre- and in-service teachers (N = 346) evaluate different learning strategies for six scenarios, and how they justify their answers. Results showed that teachers mostly evaluate strategies found to be effective in previous empirical studies as more effective and they can provide proper scientific justifications, though some justifications included misconceptions. Teachers were most confused when comparing interleaving versus blocking and retrieval versus concept mapping. Configural frequency analysis showed that justifications were generally, but not always, consistent with evaluations. These findings refer to the importance of examining teacher knowledge both with evaluations and with open-end questions. Misconceptions identified by justifications comprise useful information for planning teacher-training courses. © 2022 Scandinavian Journal of Educational Research.

AB  - Creating concept maps is considered to be a powerful means for learning. It requires students to systematically organize and integrate their knowledge, which can foster meaningful learning. However, students scarcely spontaneously engage in the (meta)cognitive processes necessary for effective knowledge integration, such as reflection, which can hamper the effectiveness of concept mapping for learning. This study explores the effect of additional support that stimulates reflection by means of expert examples, reflection prompts, and classroom discussion. First-year technical vocational students (N = 144, Mage = 17.5 years) studied electricity-related topics in an online learning environment and created concept maps about their knowledge. Students’ concept maps were supplemented with either (1) no support (control condition), (2) an expert example (a combined concept map, containing their own and an expert example concept map, with differences highlighted), (3) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually, (4) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually after a teacher-guided classroom discussion. Students in the classroom discussion condition showed higher learning gains compared to all other conditions. This can be explained by the quality of their reflection, which proved to be a significant predictor of learning gain. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Concept maps have been verified as an effective learning tool in technology-supported learning environments, in particular, in K-12 education. To enable educational technology researchers and school teachers to thoroughly know the research foci and applications of concept maps in technology-supported learning environments for K-12 education (CM-K12), the present study conducted a systematic review of studies published in seven SSCI (Social Science Citation Index) journals of educational technology by referring to the technology-based learning model. The review results showed that concept maps mostly played the role of a personal Mindtool and a collaborative Mindtool, and were mainly applied in elementary schools. The majority of elementary school teachers employed concept maps as a collaborative Mindtool (for a learning group), a personal Mindtool (for individual students), and a learning design tool. As for secondary school teachers, concept maps were mostly adopted as an assessment and evaluation tool, personal Mindtools, and collaborative Mindtools. In terms of application issues, the most adopted medium was desk-top computers, and the most adopted application domains were science, engineering, and language. The research focus explored the most in CM-K12 research was cognition, followed by affect and learning behavior. Based on the findings, several recommendations are proposed. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Conflict regulation is deemed a highly important lifelong learning skill with which individuals should be equipped. This study sought to measure the effect of achievement goal orientations on socio-cognitive conflict regulation strategies and to assess the impact of designated learning activity with collaborative digital concept mapping on these strategies. Data were gathered from 66 second-year Social Sciences undergraduate students on the completion of the learning activity. Results mainly showed that the learning activity with digital concept mapping positively contributed to students’ collaborative and critical socio-cognitive conflict regulation strategies rather than competitive strategies. Performance goal orientation increased less competitive collaborative socio-cognitive conflict regulation strategies. These findings underscore the importance of equipping individuals with a set of skills that enables them to effectively regulate conflicts by engaging them in socio-cognitive argumentation activities during their educational attainment. Such activities may raise their awareness of more collaborative strategies of regulation when faced with different types of conflict situations. © 2023 International Association for Conflict Management.

AB  - The way in which one understands information and concepts, and the way a student works to develop this, is an individual aspect of learning that cannot be universally defined as (at least manifested) the same for everyone. ‘Understanding’ is a broad term, and the way one achieves understanding is dependent on the way that material is presented. In this article, we argue that the philosophy of science can be important to nursing education—in particular, by showing that the way we imbue understanding might depend on the meaning of ‘understanding’. Diagrams and concept maps are meant to guide newly formed knowledge and connections to develop proper thinking (e.g., the order in which nursing students must prioritize data) that a student requires in the field. We argue that whether or not an image/diagram/concept map confers understanding will depend on both what the object is and what we mean by ‘understanding’. © 2023 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Concept mapping is widely used as a tool for assessing students' understanding of science. To fully realize the diagnostic potential of concept mapping, a scoring method that not only provides an objective and accurate assessment of students' drawn concept maps but also provides a detailed understanding of students' proficiency and deficiencies in knowledge is necessary. However, few of the existing scoring methods focus on the latent constructs (e.g., knowledge, skills, and cognitive processes) that guide the creation of concept maps. Instead, they focus on the completeness of the concept map by assigning a composite score, which makes it difficult to generate targeted diagnostic feedback information for advancing students' learning. To apply the diagnostic classification model to the quantitative analysis of concept maps, this study introduced the novel application of the item expansion-based diagnostic classification analysis (IE-DCA) for this purpose. The IE-DCA can not only assess students' concept mapping abilities along a continuum but also classify students according to their concept mapping attributes when constructing the concept maps. The application and benefits of this approach were illustrated using a physics concept-mapping item related to particle and rigid body. Results showed that the estimated attribute profiles via the IE-DCA provided more detailed information about students' latent constructs than the composite score. Overall, this study illustrates the feasibility and potential of applying IE-DCA to analyze concept maps. Future applications of IE-DCS in other assessments in science education are discussed. © 2023 National Association for Research in Science Teaching.

AB  - Concept maps were originally created in 1972 as part of a research program to assess longitudinal changes in children’s knowledge of science (Novak & Musonda, 1991). Since then, a large body of research has developed documenting their effectiveness for achieving various outcomes across education levels and disciplines (Daley, Conceição, Mina, Altman, Baldor, & Brown, 2010; Daley & Torre, 2010, Novak & Cañas, 2006; Novak & Cañas, 2010; Novak & Musonda, 1991). Concept maps have recently been used to plan research proposals, analyze qualitative research data, and capture expert knowledge. They are widely considered a direct application of constructivist epistemology to human learning (Novak, 2010). © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background Latin America and the Caribbean Region are home to about 42 million Indigenous people, with about 900,000 living in Brazil. The little routinely collected population-level data from Indigenous communities in the region available shows stark inequities in health and wellbeing. There are 305 Indigenous ethnic groups, speaking 274 languages, spread across the remote national territory, who have endured long-lasting inequities related to poverty, poor health, and limited access to health care. Malnutrition and mental health are key concerns for young people. Building on our Indigenous communities-academic partnerships over the last two decades, we collaborated with young people from the Terena Indigenous ethnic group, village leaders, teachers, parents, and local health practitioners from the Polo Base (community health centres) to obtain their perspectives on important and feasible actions for a youth health promotion programme. Methods The report was conducted in the Tereré Village in Mato Grosso do Sul. Concept mapping, a participatory mixed method approach, was conducted in 7 workshops, 15 adults and 40 youths aged 9–17 years. Art-based concept mapping was used with 9 to 11 years old children (N = 20). Concept systems software was used to create concept maps, which were finalised during the workshops. Focused prompts related to factors that may influence the health and happiness of youths. The participatory method gave Terena youths a significant voice in shaping an agenda that can improve their health. Results Terena youths identified priority actions that clustered under ‘Family’, ‘School’, ‘Education’, ‘Socio-economic circumstances’, ‘Respect’ and ‘Sport’ in response to protecting happiness; and ‘Nutrition pattern’, ‘Physical activity’, ‘Local environment’, and ‘Well-being’ in response to having a healthy body. Through the participatory lens of concept mapping, youths articulated the interconnectedness of priority actions across these clusters such that behaviours (e.g. Nutrition pattern, drinking water, physical activity) and aspirations (being able to read, to have a good job) were recognised to be dependent on a wider ecology of factors (e.g. loss of eco-systems, parent-child relationships, student- teacher relationships, parental unemployment). In response to developing youth health, Terena adults suggested priority actions that clustered under ‘Relationships’, ‘Health issues’, ‘Prevention at Polo Base’, ‘Access to health care’, ‘Communication with young people’, ‘Community life’, ‘Raising awareness’ and ‘School support’. Their priorities reflected the need for structural transformative actions (e.g. Polo Base and school staff working together) and for embedding actions to protect Indigenous culture (e.g. integrating their cultural knowledge into training programmes). Conclusions Concept maps of Indigenous youths emphasised the need for a health promotion programme that engages with the structural and social determinants of health to protect their happiness and health, whilst those of adults emphasised the need to address specific health issues through preventative care via a school-Polo Base collaboration. Investment in a co-developed school-Polo-Base health promotion programme, with intersectoral engagement, has potential for making Indigenous health systems responsive to the inequalities of youth health, to yield dividends for healthy ageing trajectories as well as for the health of the next generation. © 2023 C.

AB  - Background: acquisition of bioscience knowledge is challenging for nursing students. This calls for teaching methodologies that allow them to acquire this knowledge and add value in the nursing context. Objective: to evaluate a teaching experience using a movie clip and the collaborative use of C-Maps in first-year bioscience learning in nursing students. Design: embedded mixed methods study. Participants: 143 students. Methods: data were collected in two phases: first, collecting quantitative data through a questionnaire on utility, satisfaction and perceived competency development, and collecting qualitative data on learning, teaching materials and developed competencies through an open-question instrument. The second phase consisted of a focus group to explore in greater depth learning experience. Results: six themes emerged from the qualitative analysis: using C-Maps as a learning process; developing group competencies; knowledge integration and transfer; teacher-student relationship; art as a didactic support; and difficulties encountered and proposals for improvement. Regarding utility, the students highlighted learning and relating concepts. Elements of satisfaction were working in small groups and having the teacher as a guide. Finally, the competencies most developed were teamwork and learning ability. Conclusion: the combination of a movie clip and a C-Map is an innovative strategy motivating and valuable for learning biosciences. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Currently, the world needs health-literate citizens who are able to make informed decisions about COVID-19 and other diseases. Here, we propose a COVID-19 roadmap consisting of four commented maps about infection, diagnosis, defense, treatment, and prevention. We built the maps based on those from the Atlas of Science Literacy following a qualitative methodology. Main ideas about health linked to COVID-19 and how they relate to each other can be visualized in the maps in an organized structure and according to K-levels. The maps are accompanied by a text that relates the health ideas to the COVID-19 disease. This tool can be used to promote health education and, ultimately, health literacy through the teaching and learning of COVID-19. . © 2023 National Association of Biology Teachers, Inc.

AB  - The use of primary literature can be an effective way to expose students to the scientific research process. At the same time, primary literature can be intimidating to many students, particularly those with limited exposure to science research. The CREATE (consider, read, elucidate hypotheses, analyze and interpret the data, and think of the next experiment) method is an evidence-based teaching strategy that uses a structured series of pedagogical tools to allow students to perform intensive analysis of primary literature. The use of CREATE in biology classes increased student self-rated attitudes, confidence, and understanding of science. On the basis of these prior reports, we implemented CREATE in a one-semester, stand-alone, undergraduate chemistry course in which students analyzed a linked series of primary literature articles tracking the trajectory of a specific area of chemistry research. The course was aimed at second-year students, and our goals were to increase student confidence in engaging scientific literature, demystify the scientific process, and help students see themselves as having a role in that process. Pre- and post-course surveys indicated significant increases in understanding of the scientific process, along with gains in self-rated skills and attitudes related to science. Students also demonstrated gains in course content knowledge as assessed by a pre- and post-course concept mapping exercise. Thus, the CREATE method has been implemented in a chemistry teaching context that resulted in increased student knowledge.  © 2023 American Chemical Society.

AB  - To foster a deeper understanding of pharmacology concepts among physician assistant students, we integrated concept mapping into our flipped teaching to provide assessment for learning. Different mapping-based assessment strategies were adopted based on learner feedback, including in-person collaborative mapping, an individual computerized mapping-based quiz with automated feedback, and a collaborative computerized mapping-based quiz enhanced by the jigsaw strategy. Each mapping activity also leveraged the strength of a specific technology platform. Based on the findings from comparing learner ratings of these mapping activities and thematic analysis of learner feedback, we engaged in critical reflection and share our lessons learned. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - The information available today is scattered everywhere. The traditional method of learning which is completely text-based takes more time to understand. Students must learn more in less time and also have good knowledge of the concepts which are not only present in the textbooks, but also from external sources. Visual learning techniques are the most well-known effective way to learn more information in less time. When information is presented visually, it is easy to understand the concepts and remember them for a long time. The knowledge graph is used to represent the information with the relationship between the different topics in a visually comprehensive manner. Our project aims in helping students to learn visually with the help of knowledge graphs (or concept maps). The Graphs for various subjects will be available separately and can be used by students to learn interactively. Our project is mainly focused on subjects from the computer science domain. For the knowledge graph construction, the required data is scraped from the internet using Wikipedia and Google Knowledge APIs. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process scrapped data from the internet which is then processed using a graph database to display the knowledge graph with the data and the relationship connecting the data. All graphs are made in such a way to make a visual impact on learners such that it is easy to read and interpret. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Despite their potential to ameliorate health disparities and address youth substance use, prevention programs have been poorly disseminated and implemented across Hawai‘i, which begs the question: Why are effective prevention programs not being used in communities most in need of them? Implementing and sustaining culturally grounded prevention programs is critical to address equitable healthcare and minimize health disparities in communities. The field of implementation science provides frameworks, theories, and methods to examine factors associated with community adoption of these programs. Method: Our project applies concept mapping methods to a culturally grounded youth drug prevention program with state level educational leadership in rural Hawai‘i schools. The goal is to integrate barrier and facilitator salience collected through teacher and school staff surveys and specific implementation strategies to regionally tailored implementation plans on Hawai‘i island. This protocol paper describes the concept mapping steps and how they will be applied in public and public-charter schools. Discussion: Improving prevention program implementation in rural schools can result in sustained support for populations that need it most. The project will integrate implementation science and culturally grounded methods in rural Hawai‘i, where most youth are of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander descent. This project addresses health disparities among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander youth and provides actionable plans for rural Hawai‘i communities to implement effective prevention programming. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - Concept mapping remains widely used in education. However, little is known about how self-constructed concept maps and peer feedback can improve student learning outcomes in chemistry. We investigated the effects of peer feedback on concept mapping and how it improves students' learning performance in a large second-semester, introductory chemistry course. Three hundred and twenty students were randomly assigned to one of two concept mapping conditions: self-constructed concept map with peer feedback and self-constructed concept map without peer feedback. Each group constructed concept maps that depicted the relationship between concepts on the topic of intermolecular force. The results showed that students in the self-constructed concept map with peer feedback condition outperformed students in the no peer feedback condition in chemistry learning outcome. Overall, this study demonstrates that peer feedback enhances the effectiveness of learning with generative concept maps. The implications and future directions are discussed. © 2023 The Authors.

AB  - This study aims to analyze how visual tools, labeled as maps, are built, and used in medical education. Based on the educational model of concept maps (CMs), proposed by Novak and Cañas (2008), and adapted to medicine by Daley and Torre (2010), we are currently analyzing the results of a scoping review following the PRISMA extension methodology, specifically for these purposes. Other visual tools, such as knowledge maps (KMs) and mind maps (MMs), used in medical education, were also included. The search was made through the databases EBSCO, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Eric, using the following items: “concept map*”, “knowledge map*”, “mind map*” and “medical education”. Only articles in English were considered and exclusively in medical education, from undergraduate to resident training. The analysis of selected articles included the following features: construction rules (if they followed Novakian instructions), teaching area, student level (undergraduate, postgraduate/residents), and use for assessment. Other features were the capacity to relate basic science knowledge to clinical concepts, the use of maps with other educational methods, such as problem-based learning (PBL), and providing feedback to students. From a quantitative perspective, the use of CMs is dominant in all phases of medical education. A failure to follow Novakian rules was found in around half of the articles labeled as CMs and KMs. As for MMs, which follow different rules for construction and use, they were considered relevant in helping students to summarize and retain information. Simultaneous use with other educational methods was only found with CMs. © 2023 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - In this chapter the lesson plan is viewed as a product of the planning process and so it is not our intention to provide examples of completed plans. Concept mapping as a visual tool for representing knowledge has been utilised for several years and was championed by the work of Novak and his colleagues in his research exploring children’s development of conceptual understanding in science. Deconstructing critical incidents with beginning teacher is a powerful way of developing their reflective skills of noticing and interpreting. Mathematical knowledge has long been thought of as a set of absolute truths where each new discovery is based on previous known truths and linked by a logical, deductive reasoning process. Changes can then be considered which are more likely to lead to genuine improvement. An outcome that every mentor and beginning teacher desires. © 2024 selection and editorial matter, Rosa Archer, Siân Morgan, David Swanson, Claire Clemmet and Stefanie Sullivan; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Background: Mexican–American immigrants have a disparate prevalence of overweight/obesity, and obesogenic illness. One approach is to train immigrant adolescents as “community researchers.” Aims: (1) Design a program to train community researchers to address obesity among Mexican immigrant families and (2) identify the key components of a successful program. Methods: The content included an overview of community research/citizen science; obesity and food insecurity; study design and data collection and analysis for nutrition and physical activity. The students concluded by analyzing the results of group concept mapping (GCM) activities. Results: Post-session class discussions reflected an increased understanding of weekly topics. Analysis of GCM data suggests that members of the Mexican immigrant community may use emotional eating as a way to manage structural stigma, eventually leading to truncal obesity, T2DM and increased cardiovascular risk. Conclusions: Adolescents of Mexican heritage can have a major impact in promoting healthy lifestyles in their communities. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Science educators highlight the importance of developing systems thinking (ST) and futures thinking (FT) for students to make decisions and to be active citizens that address socioscientific problems. The dimensions related to FT take in this study were three implied in ST and two in the appropriation of the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the level of FT-related dimensions developed by a group of pre-service elementary teachers and how far different activities designed to foster them were effective. Written explanations presented by the participants about the origin of pandemics and possible ways to prevent them, as well as videos developed by small groups with the goal to present a campaign for avoiding future pandemics, were analysed. Based on the literature, five dimensions and up to four levels of performances were identified. After completing the activities, participants were able to relate the three spheres of the “One Health” notion to explain the causes of pandemics. Moreover, they established complex cause-effect relationships between the different factors, although they only constructed monocausal relationships when proposing measures. Participants improved their performance in anticipating the future and identifying themselves as agents of change. The elaboration of concept maps facilitated the development of components and behaviour ST dimensions, and the design of the campaign allowed participants to identify themselves as agents of change. The use of these strategies in science education can contribute to the development of a citizenry capable of understanding and acting on systems. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Computers are promising tools for providing educational experiences that meet individual learning needs. However, delivering this promise in practice is challenging, particularly when automated feedback is essential and the learning extends beyond using traditional methods such as writing and solving mathematics problems. We hypothesize that interactive knowledge representations can be deployed to address this challenge. Knowledge representations differ markedly from concept maps. Where the latter uses nodes (concepts) and arcs (links between concepts), a knowledge representation is based on an ontology that facilitates automated reasoning. By adjusting this reasoning towards interacting with learners for the benefit of learning, a new class of educational instruments emerges. In this contribution, we present three projects that use an interactive knowledge representation as their foundation. DynaLearn supports learners in acquiring system thinking skills. Minds-On helps learners to deepen their understanding of phenomena while performing experiments. Interactive Concept Cartoons engage learners in a science-based discussion about controversial topics. Each of these approaches has been developed iteratively in collaboration with teachers and tested in real classrooms, resulting in a suite of lessons available online. Evaluation studies involving pre-/post-tests and action-log data show that learners are easily capable of working with these educational instruments and that the instruments thus enable a semi-automated approach to constructive learning. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students—even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Objective Physicians tend to focus on biomedical targets while little is known about issues important to patients. We aimed to identify critical concepts impacting patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Design We performed a survey of patients with IBD in biologic therapy (n=172) and used a validated qualitative method called group concept mapping (GCM) in patient workshops. The survey included 13 questions on attitudes toward symptoms and issues related to IBD. In the eight workshops, patients (n=26) generated statements later clustered into concepts identifying issues impacting a patient's life. Patients ranked the statements. Results In the survey, patients' mean age were 40 years (SD 13), 53% were women, and 38% had ulcerative colitis. They identified fatigue (57%) and stool frequency (46%) as the most critical symptoms impacting their daily lives regardless of disease activity. In the GCM workshops with Crohn's disease (n=13) (median age 42 years (IQR 39-51) and 62% were women), 335 statements divided among 10 concepts were generated, and the three most important concepts were 'Positive attitudes', 'Accept and recognition', and 'Sharing knowledge and experiences in life with Crohn's disease'. In the workshops with ulcerative colitis (n=13) (median age 43 years (IQR 36-49) and 69% were women), 408 statements divided into 11 concepts were generated; the most important concepts were 'Take responsibility and control over your life', 'Medication', and 'Everyday life with ulcerative colitis'. Conclusion Focusing solely on IBD symptoms, patients identified fatigue and stool frequency to impact daily life the most. However, when investigating the disease burden in a broader perspective beyond classic IBD symptoms, patients identified concepts with focus on emotional health to be most important.

AB  - This study aims at determining the effect of using concept maps and brainstorming strategies to develop creative thinking skills among students of Islamic culture at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University. To achieve this, the research adopted the quasi-experimental method to reach the final results. The study population consisted of (477) male and female students who studied the Islamic Culture at Al-Hussein Bin Talal University for the academic year 2021/2022. An intentional sample of (130) male and female students who study the subject in the second semester was selected. The researchers prepared two scientific tools for the educational topic, the first was an educational unit from the Islamic Culture study plan, which is the unit of (Fasting), prepared according to the strategies of concept maps and brainstorming; and the second is a creative thinking test tool to measure the impact of the two teaching strategies. The results showed that there were statistically significant differences in the creative thinking test attributed to the teaching strategies, in favor of brainstorming compared to the traditional method and the concept maps. The results also showed that there were differences attributed to the concept maps strategy compared to the traditional method. Moreover, the results showed that there were no statistically significant differences between the performance arithmetic averages of the three study groups (the concept maps, the brainstorming, and the traditional method) attributed to the interaction between the strategy and gender variables on the creative thinking test. © 2023 NSP Natural Sciences Publishing Cor.

AB  - The interaction between student language use and sensemaking is an area in science learning that needs further elucidation in order to meet government standards in science education. In this study, concept mapping was used to explore the relationship between scientific language use and sensemaking defined as the interaction between the scientific concept system and everyday concepts in order to make sense of a proposed phenomenon. Eighty-eight concept maps from five different school classes and two school systems were analyzed in terms of their language use and concept formation from a Vygotskian perspective. This work proposes an intimate relationship between student language use, concept system formation and sensemaking in science, indicating possible implications for the study of learning as well as formative assessment using concept maps. © 2023 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

AB  - In conventional digital game-based learning, geographic maps are generally used to provide students with the whole picture of the gaming contexts, while the concepts to be learned are separately presented as individual gaming objects. Scholars have indicated the problems of such a gaming content design, in which students could encounter difficulties making effective connections between spatial and conceptual knowledge during the learning process, which may influence their learning effectiveness. As a result, it is a crucial and challenging issue to assist students in organizing spatial and conceptual knowledge in contextual learning environments, such as digital games. To solve this problem, an integrated concept map and geographic map-based digital gaming (CM-GMDG) approach is proposed to demonstrate how spatial and conceptual knowledge can be connected in the development of digital games. To investigate the effectiveness of the approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a social science course. Two classes of seventh graders in a high school participated in this study. The experimental group (N = 39) adopted the CM-GMDG approach while the control group (N = 23) adopted the conventional geographic map-based digital gaming (GMDG) approach. The results showed that the students using the CM-GMDG approach significantly outperformed those using the GMDG approach on learning achievement. Moreover, the learning behavioral pattern analysis results showed that compared with the control group, students in the experimental group more frequently engaged in knowledge-acquiring behaviors, such as reading learning materials and completing learning tasks. On the other hand, the control group gave up on the learning tasks more frequently by switching the gaming scenes and stopping answering questions. This indicated that the CM-GMDG approach was more helpful for guiding students to focus on their learning tasks than the GMDG approach. © 2023, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Powerful arguments have been made recently to advocate for the introduction of systems thinking in chemistry education to equip graduates to address sustainability challenges. This contribution describes systems thinking activities and an assessment tool that enables meaningful learning in first-year organic chemistry as students engage with the molecular-level foundation and real-world implications of the system under consideration. The activity incorporates concept maps and systems-oriented concept mapping extensions (SOCMEs) as visualization tools to scaffold the development of systems thinking skills. A rubric based on the SOLO taxonomy was designed and used to assess evidence of systems thinking skills demonstrated on SOCMEs. The activity was implemented in a small and a large group of 18 and 219 participants respectively, where findings from both groups are presented. The grading of six SOCMEs by three independent raters proved to be inconsistent at higher thinking SOLO levels, where rater experience was flagged as an area for future improvement to ensure raters are proficient in assessing systems thinking. However, meaningful progress was made to assess the quality of learning. The rubric was an effective tool for formative and low-stakes assessment to drive the teaching and learning of systems thinking in chemistry. © 2023 American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - This article demonstrates that didactic videos have the potential to enhance quality perception, performance and interest in engineering education. Emergency Remote Learning (ERL) imposed challenging conditions on education, and its impact was especially noticeable in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This is mainly due to intrinsic cognitive load associated with the high presence of abstract concepts and to difficulties to establish connections among subjects to foster generative processing. Suitable integration of multimedia resources might be beneficial in both regards. The use of didactic videos as pedagogical aid is expected to yield positive results in electrical engineering education, mitigating the impact caused by ERL situations. Using concept maps to identify key concepts in the Electrical Engineering BSc, this article proposes the creation and integration of nine videos to enhance conceptual learning and the creation of links among subjects. This study encompassed three academic years (from 2019 to 2022), covering pre-ERL, ERL and post-ERL scenarios, and considering a total sample of 157 students. By using a Mixed Methods research design, this study has demonstrated how the integration of didactic videos mitigated the negative effects of the unprecedented ERL conditions, with positive impact on students' perception on videos' implications in enhancing their interest and understanding of the subject's concepts.  © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Understanding the relationship between science and society is included as a core competency for biology students in the United States. However, traditional undergraduate biology instruction emphasizes scientific practice and generally avoids potentially controversial issues at the intersection of science and society, such as representation in STEM, historical unethical research experiments, biology of sex and gender, and environmental justice. As calls grow to highlight this core competency, it is critical we investigate the impact of including these topics in undergraduate biology education. Here, we implemented a semester-long ideological awareness curriculum that emphasized biases, stereotypes, and assumptions that have shaped historical and contemporary science. We taught this curriculum to one section of a non-majors introductory biology course and compared the outcomes to a section of the same course taught using traditional biology content (hereafter the ‘traditional’ section) that did not emphasize societal topics. Both sections of students created concept maps for their final exam, which we coded for ‘society’ and ‘biology’ content. We then assessed (1) the amount of societal content included in the concept maps, and (2) which societal topics were mentioned in each section. We found that students in the ideologically aware section included more societal content in their concept maps than the students in the traditional section. Students exposed to the ideological awareness modules often mentioned the topics covered in those modules, whereas students in the traditional section most commonly mentioned faulty scientific information such as pseudoscience or non-credible research, which was emphasized in the first chapter of the required text-book for both sections. Our results show students who were not engaged in activities about ideological awareness in biology had fewer notions of how society impacts science at the end of the semester. These findings highlight the importance of intentionally teaching students the bidirectional impacts of science and society.

AB  - Electrical engineering students must take an electromagnetic field theory (EMT) course. However, both educators and students are having difficulty either teaching or learning EMT. Therefore, concept map has been implemented as a formative assessment to enhance learning experience. Initially, the implementation has been done randomly without any proper design. Therefore, in this paper proposed intervention for future work will be discussed. Based on initial implementation, students who try to use this method show improvement in their understanding. © 2023 IEEE.

AB  - Formative assessment is about providing and using feedback and diagnostic information. On this basis, further learning or further teaching should be adaptive and, in the best case, optimized. However, this aspect is difficult to implement in reality, as teachers work with a large number of students and the whole process of formative assessment, especially the evaluation of student performance takes a lot of time. To address this problem, this paper presents an approach in which student performance is collected through a concept map and quickly evaluated using Machine Learning techniques. For this purpose, a concept map on the topic of mechanics was developed and used in 14 physics classes in Germany. After the student maps were analysed by two human raters on the basis of a four-level feedback scheme, a supervised Machine Learning algorithm was trained on the data. The results show a very good agreement between the human and Machine Learning evaluation. Based on these results, an embedding in everyday school life is conceivable, especially as support for teachers. In this way, the teacher can use and interpret the automatic evaluation and use it in the classroom. © 2023 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited. All rights reserved.

AB  - The learning process for a Biology topic regarding organisms and animal kingdom diversity was investigated through an innovative Interactive Didactic Sequence (IDS) which integrated the idea of “concept maps” with the Hermeneutic-Dialectic Circle (HDC). HDC is a tool for data collection and a reference for pluralist-constructivist thinking, considered a form of fourth-generation evaluation. Hofstede's cultural dimensions were also integrated into the investigation in order to facilitate mediation in an evaluative context. Students' performances (N = 25) from a São Paulo-Brazil public school were statistically evaluated. Their cultural profile was determined via the Hofstede Value Survey Model 1994 questionnaire. The elaborative process of arranging concept maps was individual (CM-individual) and integrated with HDC in groups (CM-HDC). Concept map assessment methods were based off existing literature. An improvement in students' performances (p < 0.05) that presented concept maps integrated to HDC in a more complex structure when compared to individually-built maps was observed. Employment of HDC helped form motivational/interactive dialogues between students and teachers, which, in turn, assisted in achieving greater learning through the use of concept maps. The application of the fourth-generation evaluation was improved via knowledge regarding students' cultural profiles. © 2022

AB  - This article presents a SoTL study of students’ use of concept maps in my undergraduate class “Women in Christian History,” in a mid-semester module called “the Eve project.” I present three students’ maps to show the different kinds of understandings that students developed in this literacy encounter. I am especially interested in how I can read these learning artifacts as a humanities scholar, and I use humanities theory—in this case, new materialism—to understand aspects of my students’ map-making, with a focus on the keyword “work.” I argue that the maps in my study, read through a new materialist lens, functioned as working objects in a manner that encouraged “differenciation” (inviting students to move toward multiple undefined learning outcomes), and that this is quite different from the work of “differentiation” (ranking students according to predefined learning outcomes) that concept maps traditionally perform in science classes. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - Due to advancements in research, the concept of oral health literacy (OHL) has become rich in connotations, with over 250 definitions present in the literature and government and organizational reports. The diversity of OHL definitions and connotations not only produces conflicting results but also limits the production of accurate OHL measurement and assessment tools while simultaneously hindering the construction of health literacy intervention policies. To clarify the connotations of OHL and establish a scientific basis for evaluation, we conducted a systematic review, searching and analyzing the literature related to the conceptual connotations of OHL. Additionally, we extracted basic, methodological, and OHL conceptual connotation information from the literature. With reference to the review framework, we classified the conceptual connotations of OHL into antecedents of OHL, the core of OHL, mediators, and outcomes of OHL. The comprehensive conceptual connotations of OHL were obtained through a systematic review and concept mapping based on the related literature. Our analysis revealed that the antecedents of OHL can be classified in two categories: personal factors and external factors. The core conceptual connotations of OHL include three core dimensions (with 16 subdimensions): (1) basic skills—literacy, reading comprehension, numeracy, hearing, oral expression, communication, and knowledge; (2) information-related abilities—information acquisition, information understanding, information communication, information evaluation, information utilization, and information decision-making; and (3) oral health maintenance abilities—interpersonal skills, self-regulation, and goal achievement. The mediator of these connotations is oral health behaviors, with oral health being the result of OHL. This study further clarifies the conceptual connotations of OHL, serving as a reference for future OHL-related studies. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Developing strategies to change health behaviour is one of the biggest challenges of health promotion programs. Social media, as a popular and innovative communication and education tool, offers opportunities to modify health behaviour. While literature on using social media for health promotion campaigns is growing, there is a need to evaluate the approaches used to change health behaviour, rather than only creating awareness. Objective: The paper reviewed the literature on application of social media in health promotion campaigns with a particular focus on the methodologies used in assessing the outcome of the programs for behaviour change. This fills the void in collating evidence to extend health promotion campaigns to effect sustainable behavioural change. Method: Peer-reviewed articles were identified through multiple science databases. A systematic electronic search was conducted to retrieve review and original papers published between January 2010 and April 2022. The titles and abstracts of the articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All authors independently read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes. Concept mapping was used to present results from analysis of the included papers. Results: Of the 674 citations, 28 (4.1%) studies were included in this review. The methodology approaches of 18 (2.7%) papers, that aimed to evaluate the impact of social media in health promotion campaigns towards behaviour change, were analysed further using concept mapping. The results showed that 10 studies (55.5%) adopted quantitative methods and five studies (27.7%) used mixed methods and three studies (16.6%) used qualitative methods. Facebook and YouTube were used more for intervention purposes to change health behaviour. Twitter and Instagram were used more to observe the trend of changes in health behaviour. Six studies (33.3%) adopted Social Cognitive Theory and one study (5.5%) applied the Transtheoretical Model as the framework to evaluate the outcome. Overall, the results show that though social media has potential in promoting behaviour change, the estimation of this change in long-term lies outside the scope of social media health campaigns. This is also reflected in the methodologies used in existing studies to assess such sustainable changes. The employed measures usually target immediate behaviour or social media engagement rather than addressing the change on a behavioural level. Conclusion: Evaluating the performance of social media campaigns to promote health behaviours towards a sustainable outcome is a complex process. Emerging research is focused on evaluating the potential of social media as an opportunity to create awareness. Such measures require less effort in quantifying and isolating the effect. The design of the campaigns is required to be aligned in relation to stages of the behaviour change. The study provides suggestions on how this can be achieved. © 2022, The Author(s).

AB  - A nursing programme in southern Sweden was revised to meet future demands. The aim of this study was to explore important conceptual areas to be included in a nursing programme in order to meet long-term societal and health care requirements. Group concept mapping (GCM), a mixed-methods approach, was used. Thirty-four experienced teachers participated. Data was collected during brainstorming sessions in focus groups. Following editing and removal of duplicates, 101 statements remained to be sorted into piles that had similar conceptual representation in nursing education. The final step was then to rate each statement from 1 to 5 (higher values = more important/more feasible). Quantitative analysis using non-metric multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis resulted in 11 clusters. Assessment and treatment and Person-centred care were rated as the most important and Scientific theories and methods, Basic caregiving in nursing and Person-centred care had the highest feasibility ratings. Further analyses suggested that the content of nursing education can be seen from a systems theory perspective, represented by the macro, meso, and micro levels. These levels may increase the understanding of the complexity of nursing care. Furthermore, the cluster analysis can facilitate the development of a concept-based curriculum for nursing education. © 2022 The Authors

AB  - Both physiology and pathophysiology are essential disciplines in health professional education however, clinicians do not use this knowledge in isolation. Instead, physicians use inter-disciplinary concepts embedded within integrated cognitive schema (illness scripts) established through experience/knowledge that manifest as expert-level thinking. Our goal was to develop a pre-clerkship curriculum devoid of disciplinary boundaries (akin to the physician’s illness script) and enhance learners’ clerkship and early clinical performance. As well as developing curricular content, the model considered non-content design elements such as learner characteristics and values, faculty and resources and the impact of curricular and pedagogical changes. The goals of the trans-disciplinary integration were to develop deep learning behaviors through, 1) developing of integrated, cognitive schema to support the transition to expert-level thinking, 2) authentic, contextualization to promote knowledge transfer to the clinical realm 3) allowing autonomous, independent learning, and 4) harnessing the benefits of social learning. The final curricular model was a case-based approach with independent learning of basic concepts, differential diagnosis and illness scripting writing, and concept mapping. Small-group classroom sessions were team-taught with basic scientists and physicians facilitating learners’ self-reflection and development of clinical reasoning. Specifications grading was used to assess the products (written illness scripts and concept maps) as well as process (group dynamics) while allowing a greater degree of learner autonomy. Although the model we adopted could be transferred to other program settings, we suggest it is critical to consider both content and non-content elements that are specific to the environment and learner.

AB  - Metaphoric expressions are a special linguistic phenomenon, frequently appearing in everyday language. Metaphors do not take their literal meanings in contexts, which may cause obstacles for language learners to understand them. Metaphoric expressions also reflect the cognition of humans via concept mappings, attracting great attention from cognitive science and psychology communities. Thus, we aim to develop a computational metaphor processing online system, termed MetaPro Online1, that allows users without a coding background, e.g., language learners and linguists, to easily query metaphoricity labels, metaphor paraphrases, and concept mappings for non-domainspecific text. The outputs of MetaPro can be directly used by language learners and natural language processing downstream tasks because MetaPro is an end-To-end system. © ACL-DEMO 2023. All rights reserved.

AB  - Recently the trend of words in the world is related to sustainable development such as “green” has become a new trend in everyday human life. This study aimed to analyze and map the chemistry learning with green chemistry insight for undergraduate students of chemistry education program as an effort to conserve the environment as one of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The urgency of this study is to support the achievement of SDGs through education, especially the target number 12, responsible consumption and production and/or number 13, climate action. Data collection was used exploratory method by combining primary and secondary exploratory framework. The primary method was focused on the observation qualitative or quantitative and the secondary on the literature research. Data analysis were used qualitative and quantitative descriptive. It can be concluded that; the efforts to preserve the environment through education can be pursued with green chemistry insight learning. The principles of green chemistry that can be implemented in chemistry learning on suitable material represent in some action such as; waste prevention, use the safe solvent, energy efficiency, and creating safe and secure conditions in learning both in the classroom and laboratory. Chemistry learning have the role to support SDGs through education by using some learning model/methods, such as discussion, concept map, or practical methods as well as Project Based Learning.

AB  - Background: Adhering to nursing professional ethics codes and being familiar with these codes enables nurses to make sound ethical decisions in challenging circumstances. Recognizing the significance of awareness regarding professional ethics codes and their continuous growth, this study was conducted to determine and compare the influence of classroom-based and short message service (SMS) training on the ethical sensitivity of nursing students. Methods: This study employed a quasi-experimental design and was conducted in 1401 at Yasuj University of Medical Sciences in Iran. The participants included 120 nursing students who were selected using convenience sampling based on criteria such as enrollment in the bachelor's nursing program, ability to communicate effectively, willingness to participate in the study, and scoring 50 or lower on the ethical sensitivity questionnaire. The samples were randomly assigned to three groups: intervention 1, intervention 2, and control. After obtaining the necessary ethical approvals, data were collected usi ng the Lützen Ethical Sensitivity Questionnaire. Data were collected immediately before and one month after the completion of interventions. The intervention group received a blended teaching approach, which included concept mapping, small group discussions, and role-playing sessions conducted twice a week for one month. Data analysis was performed using descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation, frequency, and percentage) and inferential statistical methods (paired t-test, chi-square test, and ANOVA) using SPSS software version 21. Results: There was a significant difference in the mean age of students among the three groups, flipped classroom, short message service, and control (p = 0.047). However, no significant difference was observed in terms of gender distribution among the three groups (p = 0.291). Prior to the intervention, there was no statistically significant difference in the overall mean score of ethical sensitivity among the three groups (p < 0.05). However, after the intervention, a significant difference was observed (p < 0.05). Post-hoc comparisons revealed a significant difference in the ethical sensitivity scores of students among the flipped classroom, short message service, and control groups (p = 0.001). Conclusion: Based on the effectiveness of both the flipped classroom and short message service methods in enhancing the ethical sensitivity of nursing students, it is recommended to incorporate these educational approaches into the nursing curriculum for planning and implementation. © The author(s).

AB  - This paper describes a work-in-progress study investigating the use of concept mapping for assessing students' conceptual knowledge over a semester in a biomedical engineering modeling course. The concept maps are used to evaluate the evolution of students' skills in developing mathematical models that describing biological systems and students' specific content knowledge as they complete problem-based learning projects. As students gain experience developing mathematical models to answer open-ended problem-based learning questions, we hypothesize that their conceptual understanding of mathematical modeling and of the biological systems studied will increase. This improved conceptual understanding is reflected by concept maps with increased complexity. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Teaching for Mastery is the idea that students should progress through material when they have conquered the previous material it depends on and each student may progress at their own pace. The paper documents the process and results of incorporating a teach for mastery system into a Computer Science Programming Language Design course. The course is aimed at junior and senior undergraduate students and its goal is to introduce them to the four main language families and to show them how to teach themselves a programming language. This teach for mastery system caused both student learning and student satisfaction to improve in a course that was already well received before these changes. Other benefits of this system include a marked decrease in the amount of time spent grading and a straightforward way to identify which subjects need to be re-thought and which are being learned to the intended depth. The system does come with an increase in the amount of contact time spent with students which is both a positive in that you develop a closer relationship with the students and a negative in that it is a large amount of contact time. Contributions include the structural changes and teaching artifacts needed to implement teaching for mastery in a course. The structural changes include flipping the classroom and replacing traditional sit-down exams with short one-topic take-when-ready exams. The teaching artifacts produced include a concept map. Students leave the course with a clear list of which topics they mastered and which they are still working on. This model still permits room for traditional laboratory and project components. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Background: The aim of this work was to explicate a conceptual framework of psychosocial elements assessed in candidates for hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) and to explore differences in the conceptualization based on the use of risk rating scales in clinical practice. Methods: Concept mapping is a mixed methods participatory approach to elicit and organize the ideas of a group of stakeholders and produce a composite conceptual framework. Participants were social workers and psychologists with experience assessing HCT candidates. Results: Participants brainstormed 114 psychosocial elements and conceptualized them into 12 distinct clusters: Transplant Mindset, Support System, Caregiver, Lodging and Transportation, Financial and Legal, Work, Demographic Characteristics, Mental Health, Communication, Educational and Resource Needs, Physical Functioning, and Cognition. Participants who used risk rating scales did not prioritize the importance of the clusters differently than those who did not. Conclusions: The conceptualization converges and diverges with the literature. Divergences are of particular interest since the perspectives of practicing psychosocial professionals have been largely absent from the literature. The conceptual framework can guide psychosocial providers in assessing patients. Assessing the caregiver is a high priority, as is evaluating the patient’s mental health and mindset about transplant. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0–5 years, 6–14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - A large number of chemistry students drop out of their studies, often because of high requirements for content knowledge. Quantum chemical models of atomic bonding such as molecular orbital (MO) theory are particularly challenging. We aimed to develop an intervention on MO theory based on the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning framework. First, students work independently with interactive learning videos. Then, they create concept maps about core concepts of MO theory. In this paper, we present the evaluation of this intervention in terms of content knowledge, considering person-specific characteristics. Additionally, we compare three different treatment groups with varying materials and group arrangements, and prospective chemistry teachers with other first-year students. Our results show that students can answer single-choice questions well with the prior knowledge from their first-year chemistry course. Answering open-ended questions is more difficult. Nevertheless, they can improve significantly in both categories by working with the learning videos; creating concept maps does not lead to significant content knowledge changes. There are also no significant differences between the three treatment groups, or between teacher students and other chemistry freshmen. Regarding prior knowledge, differences depending on gender and school-leaving grades can be measured, whereas the choice of courses in school has no effect.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.

AB  - Reductionist methods of learning and teaching chemistry have indeed advanced the disciplinary knowledge. However, they have proven deficient in connecting the chemical reactions of elements in the periodic table with the significant impacts they have on planetary and societal systems. Therefore, a systems thinking approach is required that integrates an interdisciplinary and complementary understanding of chemical concepts. Systems Oriented Concept Map Extensions (SOCME)s are an effective tool to connect interdisciplinary subsystems to the larger planetary boundaries and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs). We present a course activity where undergraduate students of an introductory green chemistry and sustainable synthesis course selected an element from the periodic table and a simple chemical reaction involving that element, to develop a SOCME. Students applied green chemistry principles, life cycle thinking and circular economy concepts to the various subsystems in their SOCME. Students also recommended an alternative greener subsystem based on their integrated understanding and research from primary literature. They connected the impacts from the subsystems of the element/reaction and the alternative greener reaction to the earth, health, economy, and society to address global challenges represented by the UN SDGs. They effectively communicated the science in their SOCME poster through a video presentation in a virtual format. Student survey data indicated that the systems, life cycle and circularity thinking connected to the UN SDGs, improved their knowledge of the wider impacts of chemistry in the world. It also increased their awareness of the role of chemists in promoting environmental and social justice. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - The intervention study presented in this paper explored pre-service science teachers’ (PSSTs) understanding of scientific inquiry (SI) and scientific practices (SPs) during a laboratory application in science education course. Thirty-nine secondary school PSSTs, who study in the Science Education Department in a public university in Turkey, enrolled in a 14-week-long course and volunteered to participate in the study. The participants were exposed to a method is called the 4-phase implementation that includes laboratory-based inquiry activities addressing SI and SPs and they completed microteaching presentations. Their understanding of SI and SPs was examined through the course period. The main data sources included Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) Instrument and concept maps were used to track the changes in these understandings. The findings indicated that PSSTs had inadequate understanding of inquiry on some aspects even after the treatment. Yet, the method had positive impact in PSSTs’ understanding inquiry especially in terms of facilitating the comprehension that scientific investigations begin with questions, there is no single method in investigations, and explanations are derived from collected data. The concept maps created by some of the participants also supported these results and revealed a more coherent and holistic understanding of SPs by integrating both epistemic and social components into their maps. However, PSSTs did not seem to have totally understood other aspects of inquiry including the inquiry procedures, the research conclusions, and the difference between data and evidence. Further implications are critically discussed in terms of designing future laboratory applications for science education courses. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Background: Although concept maps have been strongly advocated for by curriculum developers as a learning method in theory to promote critical thinking and problem –solving abilities for students, there has been widespread criticism of their use in nursing and midwifery curricula. The critic is related to being out-dated, context- driven and decontextualized with little effort of connection to student nurse ‘daily life. The majority of research about concept maps was carried out in western countries. Additionally, little is known about experiences of utilizing concept maps in other contexts. Therefore, in attempt to understand its effectiveness, context specific studies should be undertaken. Aim: The aim of this study was to explore and describe the experiences of utilizing a concept maps as a learning method in human anatomy and physiology. Design: The study employed an explorative, descriptive qualitative approach, with three written open-ended questions. Settings: The study was conducted at the public university in the north east in Namibia. Participants: Fifteen nursing students enrolled in a Bachelor of Nursing Science (Clinical) (Honours) at the public university in the north east in Namibia. Methods: The study enlisted the participation of 15 second and first-year nursing students, who were chosen using a convenience sampling approach. Data were collected by the researcher from 27 September until 18 October 2021. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect data, which were analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Data analysis led to the emergence of the following themes: Understanding of a concept map, positive experiences, negative experiences, and corrective measures to improve the utilisation of CMs. Conclusion: The findings of this study demonstrate that nursing students have both positive and negative experiences with the use of concept maps, indicating a need for improvement. Targeted interventions and strategies should be adopted to promote the utilization of concept maps as a learning method in biological sciences, so as to reinforce the mastery of learning content in human anatomy and biological science. This study recommends well-articulated plans and actions from curricular developers and educators to support and guide students through the process of developing concept maps. The guarantee of using concept maps to reach the full value of competency it was designed to achieve, calls for students to engage in more practice opportunities to reinforce the mastery of using this learning method. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: The COVID-19 pandemic showed the critical importance of supporting teachers’ and students’ systems thinking when making sense of complex phenomena. This study sets to explore preservice biology teachers’ (PBTs) mental models of COVID-19 as complex phenomenon using concept maps. Methods: 27 PBTs concept maps of COVID-19 outbreak were collected and taken for analysis. Structural and complexity attributes were identified in participants’ concept maps and the relationships between them were tested, providing statistical analyses using exemplary concept maps. Results: The results suggest that the appearance of many concepts in a map (structural attribute) does not necessarily indicate high level of complexity, but rather the amount of simple structural relationships (complexity attribute). On the other hand, the results indicate that higher structural sophistication (e.g., high number of connections and junctions) could be associated with the complexity level of the map. Discussion: This study provides a practical method for evaluating the complexity level of PBTs’ systems thinking, suggests a possible link between structural and complexity attributes in their concept maps, and demonstrates the need to further support PBTs in developing their systems thinking skills in the context of complex biological phenomena.

AB  - The Chemistry of Rare Earth Elements (REE) is a teaching-learning topic that can integrate the principles of the molecular basis of sustainabihty from economic, society, and environmental aspects. The use of molecular basis of sustainability in the teaching and learning can lead the student toward system thinking. System thinking defines as the ability to interpret a complex systems. This research was conducted to obtain a scientist's conception of REE in a form of concept map and teaching-learning sequences (TLS). The method used is qualitative content analysis (QCA) with a type of literature analysis. The initial phase is earned out by collecting material (literature) from books, monographs, review articles, and research articles. The instruments used are content analysis formats. The analysis was descriptively and structured in a didactic and pedagogical manner to strengthen student's system thinking skills The concepts obtained are compiled in the form of a concept map and TLS. The results showed that the content of REE could be analyzed through an inductive approach. The scientist's conception is obtained include definition, electromc configuration, properties. abundance, processing, and the applications. The Concept map and TLS illustrate potential intended and unintended consequences of REE. Through QCA, there is evident that system thinking can be strengthened through teaching and learning on the REE topic. Further development of this research hoped that could be used to make teaching material and didactical design. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.

AB  - Lectures containing information presented in verbal and visual form are widely used in educational settings. To date, little is known about how the visual display in a video lecture influences immediate and delayed recall. In two experiments, participants listened to a pre-recorded lecture while viewing an animated concept map, sequential listing of bulleted text, or there was no visual display. Results indicated that the concept map lecture enhanced immediate recall accuracy; however, the type of ideas recalled is also important to consider. Compared to the listen-only lecture, the concept map and bulleted text lectures promoted more recall of main ideas rather than details. Finally, the concept map lecture mainly benefitted those with high prior science achievement. These findings suggest that the visual display in a video lecture may affect the type of ideas remembered, and prior knowledge should be considered when choosing how to present information in a video lecture. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Objective Physical education, physical activity and sports provision are important factors in whole school health promotion, however, a standardised evaluation framework to evaluate the contribution of these components is lacking. A framework that accounts for the distinct structures and associated factors, that impact upon provision would facilitate a more coherent evaluation. Methods A concept mapping methodology, involving the generation of factors relevant to school physical education, physical activity and sports provision and their subsequent thematic and numeric rating and sorting was utilised. Concept mapping effectively gathers, integrates, and visually and numerically represents the composite thinking of a group of relevant and expert stakeholders around a complex social phenomenon. Following a review of the extant literature and synthesis among 20 expert stakeholders, a list of 95 factor statements relevant to school physical education, physical activity and sports provision were developed. Results Each factor statement was rated and sorted by 197 multi-disciplinary participants. An eightcluster framework that demonstrated good validity (stress value: 0.266), was derived from the data based on: 1. Partnerships and Pupil Centered Physical Education; 2. Physical Activity and Sports; 3. School Demographics; 4. Equipment, Facilities and Budget; 5. Extra Costs; 6. Curriculum and Policy; 7. School Management and 8. Timetable. Statements within the cluster on school management received the highest mean importance and modifiability ratings while statements within the cluster on school demographics received the lowest mean importance and modifiability ratings. Conclusions Eight overarching structures which account for school physical education, physical activity and sports provision have been identified. Within each of these, structures and overall factors of greatest importance and modifiability have been illuminated. Findings stemming from this rigorous methodology, provide the foundation for the development of a national provision evaluation index to inform both school-level and national policy and actions. It is recommended the current methodology is replicated in other nations to gain corresponding insights.  © 2023 Rocliffe et al.

AB  - Learning activities are conducted to help students achieve optimal academic achievement. This research aims to optimize student academic achievement through a learning process that integrates comprehensive formative assessments, including formative tests, self-assessment, peer assessment, and the initiator of creating summaries or concept maps that are given to students in a structured manner at the end of every lesson. The research method used was a quasi-experimental method with a 2x2 factorial design. Students enrolled in the biology education program of the basic physics course for the 1st semester of the 2019 academic year participated in this study. The participants were 66 undergraduate students divided into two classes. Thirty-four students in the experimental group were in class A, while 32 students in the control group were in class B. Data were collected using a learning outcome test instrument to measure academic achievement, which was tested at the end of the semester. Data were analyzed using a two-way ANOVA. This study concluded that a learning process that includes comprehensive formative assessment significantly affects students' academic achievement. These findings support the theory that formative assessment provides feedback, correction, and improvement in student learning.  © 2023 The Author(s).

AB  - Since the first reports of the Covid-19 virus in December 2019, the tourism industry has struggled to find solutions to this unprecedented crisis. During crises, organizational learning can develop crisis management and communication skills while enhancing organizational resilience in coping with crises. This research examines whether organizational learning for communicating during crises occurred in the Swiss hotel industry in the past 2 years. By tracking and visualizing the messages communicated by Swiss hotels on their websites, this study analyzes the communication strategies employed by hoteliers over the past 20 months through thematic analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and Situational Crisis Communication (SCCT) strategies. The results of this study identified the evolution of communication strategies over time. Specifically, ingratiation, corrective action, transferring, victimization, and justification are the five key strategies. This study also visualizes the crisis responses in concept maps in three snapshots (June 2020, June 2021, and February 2022). The concepts and colors of the visualization provide a different perspective on the evolution of crisis communication over the past 2 years. This study contributes to academia and practitioners by demonstrating the evolution of crisis communication messages through both the granular analysis of SCCT strategies and the bird’s-eye view of themes and concepts. © The Author(s) 2023.

AB  - We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging “math” and “learning”. These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between ‘maths”/“physics” and key motivational aspects of learning (“fun”, “work”, “failure”) in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge “maths” and “fun” only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers’ mindset stream, which rather bridges “math” and “fun” through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge “maths” and “physics” to “work” through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students’ mindset streams of “failure” and “math”/“physics” are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate “failure” and “math”/“physics” in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning. We discuss our findings and future research directions in view of relevant psychology/education literature. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - In this study, we used propositional concept maps with different ocean-related conceptual sentences to assess the ocean literacy of maritime vocational high school students in Grades 10–12 in Indonesia. Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelagic country, and many aspects of people’s lives, including their jobs, are related to the ocean. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the ocean literacy and related knowledge of students, especially maritime vocational high school students. Thus, in this study, an open-ended questionnaire was employed to acquire data from 255 students at the National Vocational High School 1 Temon in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A total of 215 males and 40 females participated in this study. In addition to descriptive analysis, we used a one-way analysis of variance and a t-test for statistical inference. The results showed that 11th and 12th graders scored significantly higher in ocean literacy than 10th graders, and female students significantly outperformed male students. Furthermore, student learning was teacher-centered. In this paper, we summarize the results and provide suggestions and references concerning ocean literacy for teachers and high school students. © 2023 by the authors.

AB  - Purpose: The ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic is contingent upon the ability to effectively manage its heterogeneous knowledge resources. Knowledge mapping represents a great opportunity to create value by bringing stakeholders together, facilitating comprehensive collaboration and facilitating broader in-depth knowledge sharing and transfer. However, identifying and analysing critical knowledge areas is one of the most important steps when creating a knowledge map. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to appraise the critical knowledge areas for managing COVID-19, and thereby enhance decision-making in tackling the consequences of the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach for this study is a critical literature review, covering publications on knowledge management, knowledge mapping and COVID-19. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, TRID, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library were searched for full text, peer-reviewed articles written in English that investigated on critical knowledge areas for managing the spread of COVID-19. After full screening, 21 articles met the criteria for inclusion and were analysed and reported. Findings: The study revealed seven critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. These are cleaning and disinfection; training, education and communication; reporting guidance and updates; testing; infection control measures, personal protective equipment; and potential COVID-19 transmission in health and other care settings. The study developed a concept knowledge map illustrating areas of critical knowledge which decision-makers need to be aware of. Practical implications: Providing decision-makers with access to key knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be crucial for effective decision-making. This study has provided insights for the professionals and decision-makers identifying the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Social implications: The study advances the literature on knowledge management and builds a theoretical link with the management of public health emergencies. Additionally, the findings support the theoretical position that knowledge maps facilitate decision-making and help users to identify critical knowledge areas easily and effectively. Originality/value: This study fills gaps in the existing literature by providing an explicit representation of know-how for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses an objective and qualitative approach by reviewing related publications, reports and guidelines in the analysis. The concept map illustrates the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: First-generation migrant youth experience higher levels of stress than their Canadian-born counterparts but have lower mental health service utilization rates. Objective: The present study aims to report on the social context of migrant youth, focusing on their own experiences of post-migration stressors that impact their mental health. Methods: The study utilized Concept Mapping in which participants responded to the open-ended question “What are the mental health stressors that you face?”. Youth participants then independently grouped responses made by all youth into concepts. Results: Participants grouped the statements into seven concepts, including stressors associated with family, isolation, communication, anxiety, overburdened, school difficulties and working with others. Conclusions: Post-migration stressors for migrant youth exist in a social context where they experience racism and discrimination. The stressors can intersect and accumulate, leading to the perceived necessity and associated pressure to meet others’ expectations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Coastal social-ecological systems (SES) are essential for the wellbeing of coastal communities and the wider society. However, in many parts of the world coastal SES face rapid change, and ultimately degradation. In this paper we unravel the mechanisms and implications of change in coastal SESmobilising multiple sources of knowledge, including scientific, expert-based and traditional and local knowledge (TLK). We focus on the rapidly changing Nakatsu mudflat in Japan, and combine primary and secondary data elicited through a mixed-method participatory approach that mobilised local stakeholders with different types of engagement with (and knowledge of) the mudflat. Through 4 expert interviews and 40 questionnaire surveys we identified the main ecosystem services provided by the mudflat that are perceived to be essential to the wellbeing of the local community. Although practically all respondents identified food provision as an important mudflat ecosystem services, many also pointed to the importance of some cultural (e.g. aesthetic beauty, spirituality, education and knowledge) and supporting services (e.g. habitat provision, sediment formation/retention). Through 8 Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and concept mapping we identified and systematized the underlying direct and indirect drivers of ecosystem change in the Nakatsu mudflat. These include population ageing and shrinking, economic diversification, and technological change that have collectively eroded TLK practices associated with the sustainable use of the mudflat. We also identified the mechanisms mediating these drivers and how they unfold in reality. Our study demonstrates that participatory processes engaging multiple stakeholders with different types of knowledge can provide rich and useful information on coastal SES change, which might not be readily obvious from simple headline indicators such as the change in the extent of the SES. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Asking good questions is vital for scientific learning and discovery, but improving this complex skill is a formidable challenge. Here, we show in two experiments (N = 152) that teaching others—learningby-teaching—enhances one’s ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge, relative to two other well-established generative learning techniques: retrieval practice and concept-mapping. Learners who taught scientific expository texts across natural and social sciences topics by delivering video-recorded lectures outperformed their peers who practiced retrieval or constructed concept maps when tested on their ability to generate create-level research questions based on the texts (Experiment 1). This advantage held reliably even on a delayed test 48 hr later, and when all learners similarly received and responded to poststudy questions on the material (Experiment 2). Moreover, across both immediate and delayed tests, learning-by-teaching produced a recall benefit that rivaled that of the potent technique of retrieval practice. In contrast, despite recalling more than twice the study content that the concept-mapping group did, learners who practiced retrieval were unable to generate more create-level research questions based on that content. Three supplemental experiments (N = 168) further showed that retrieval practice consistently did not improve higher-order question generation over restudying, despite yielding superior long-term retention. Altogether, these findings reveal that simply possessing a wealth of factual knowledge is insufficient for generating higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Rather, teaching others is a powerful strategy for producing deep and durable learning that enables research question generation. To ask better questions, teach. © 2023 American Psychological Association

AB  - Lunar soils will be an important feedstock for multiple space resource utilization applications including preparing sites for infrastructure, extracting metals, and manufacturing products. On Earth, soil classification systems provide a logical way to categorize different soils and are applied in soil surveys for development projects. However, these systems and others used for soil science are not appropriate to translate to the Moon because of fundamental differences in soil properties, especially clay and moisture content. Here, I propose a lunar soil classification system based on practical space resource use cases. The system includes bulk elemental composition and particle size distribution as its main variables to form 9 soil groups and can be extended with tags that represent additional properties like glass content or other mineral/elemental components. The system is designed to be simple to apply: classification criteria can be measured with in-situ instruments as well as remote sensing. Proof of concept maps are developed globally, and the Apollo 17 sample collection is used as ground truth for orbital-derived classifications over the Taurus-Littrow valley. The different soil groups are expected to perform better or poorer for specific use cases. For example, coarse grained soils will have higher flowability and higher compressibility that are important for excavation and conveyance. Mare composition soils will have lower melting points and are enriched in FeO and TiO2 as sources of iron and titanium. Adopting a simple, standardized classification scheme will improve communication between different players for assessing resources, developing and testing hardware, and eventually selling raw and refined lunar materials. © 2023 The Author

AB  - This research provides an overview of the current state of scientific literature related to suicide and physical activity (PA). A bibliometric analysis of studies published between 1996 and 2022 in The Web of Science (WoS) was carried out, applying the traditional bibliometric laws, using Microsoft Excel and the VOSviewer software for data and metadata processing. A total of 368 documents (349 primary research and 19 reviews) were extracted from 70 WoS categories. The results revealed an exponential increase in scientific production from 2017 to 2022 (R2 = 88%), revealing the United States hegemony being the most productive country, with 156 of the publications (42.4%), the most cited (4181 citations) being the centre of a collaborative network with links to 35 countries and having April Smith, from the Miami University, as the most prolific author (eight publications) and Thomas Joiner, from the Florida State University, as the most cited author (513 citations). The Psychiatry WoS category, with 155 papers, had the highest number of publications, and The Journal of Affective Disorders, from Elsevier, had the highest number of published papers within this category. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) underestimation of prostate cancer extent complicates the definition of focal treatment margins. Objective: To validate focal treatment margins produced by an artificial intelligence (AI) model. Design, setting, and participants: Testing was conducted retrospectively in an independent dataset of 50 consecutive patients who had radical prostatectomy for intermediate-risk cancer. An AI deep learning model incorporated multimodal imaging and biopsy data to produce three-dimensional cancer estimation maps and margins. AI margins were compared with conventional MRI regions of interest (ROIs), 10-mm margins around ROIs, and hemigland margins. The AI model also furnished predictions of negative surgical margin probability, which were assessed for accuracy. Outcome measurements and statistical analysis: Comparing AI with conventional margins, sensitivity was evaluated using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and negative margin rates using chi-square tests. Predicted versus observed negative margin probability was assessed using linear regression. Clinically significant prostate cancer (International Society of Urological Pathology grade ≥2) delineated on whole-mount histopathology served as ground truth. Results and limitations: The mean sensitivity for cancer-bearing voxels was higher for AI margins (97%) than for conventional ROIs (37%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (93%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (94%, p < 0.001). For index lesions, AI margins were more often negative (90%) than conventional ROIs (0%, p < 0.001), 10-mm ROI margins (82%, p = 0.24), and hemigland margins (66%, p = 0.004). Predicted and observed negative margin probabilities were strongly correlated (R2 = 0.98, median error = 4%). Limitations include a validation dataset derived from a single institution's prostatectomy population. Conclusions: The AI model was accurate and effective in an independent test set. This approach could improve and standardize treatment margin definition, potentially reducing cancer recurrence rates. Furthermore, an accurate assessment of negative margin probability could facilitate informed decision-making for patients and physicians. Patient summary: Artificial intelligence was used to predict the extent of tumors in surgically removed prostate specimens. It predicted tumor margins more accurately than conventional methods. © 2023 The Author(s)

AB  - Introduction: Video-based review of surgical procedures has proven to be useful in training by enabling efficiency in the qualitative assessment of surgical skill and intraoperative decision-making. Current video segmentation protocols focus largely on procedural steps. Although some operations are more complex than others, many of the steps in any given procedure involve an intricate choreography of basic maneuvers such as suturing, knot tying, and cutting. The use of these maneuvers at certain procedural steps can convey information that aids in the assessment of the complexity of the procedure, surgical preference, and skill. Our study aims to develop and evaluate an algorithm to identify these maneuvers. Methods: A standard deep learning architecture was used to differentiate between suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting on a data set comprised of videos from practicing clinicians (N = 52) who participated in a simulated enterotomy repair. Perception of the added value to traditional artificial intelligence segmentation was explored by qualitatively examining the utility of identifying maneuvers in a subset of steps for an open colon resection. Results: An accuracy of 84% was reached in differentiating maneuvers. The precision in detecting the basic maneuvers was 87.9%, 60%, and 90.9% for suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting, respectively. The qualitative concept mapping confirmed realistic scenarios that could benefit from basic maneuver identification. Conclusions: Basic maneuvers can indicate error management activity or safety measures and allow for the assessment of skill. Our deep learning algorithm identified basic maneuvers with reasonable accuracy. Such models can aid in artificial intelligence-assisted video review by providing additional information that can complement traditional video segmentation protocols. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The field of electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) is to ensure that electrical systems will function as intended in an electromagnetic environment. EMC is important in electronic design since all electronics in the market must comply with EMC regulations. The main goal of the EMC course is to provide students with a fundamental understanding of EMC principles to prepare them for future careers in industry and academia. To enhance student engagement and interest, several new teaching practices were proposed and implemented during the fall 2022 semester. These practices included making real-world connections to the course materials, using concept maps to depict the connections between high-level concepts and lower-level facts, incorporating cartoon pictures into the classroom to add a sense of humor, and a gamified approach in the form of a Jeopardy-style game. These approaches are adopted to help students reinforce their knowledge and gain a stronger understanding of EMC concepts. The emphasis of this paper will be on improving the EMC course curriculum through the integration of engaging and interactive instructional activities into traditional classroom settings. We first give a general overview of the course's development and contents, then present a detailed discussion of new teaching strategies. Finally, key findings from the course implementation process as well as student feedback are presented. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Ethics education has been recognized as increasingly important to engineering over the past two decades, although disagreement exists concerning how ethics can and should be taught in the classroom. With the support from the National Science Foundation (NSF) Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) program, a collaboration of investigators from the University of Connecticut, New Jersey Institute of Technology, University of Pittsburgh, and Rowan University are conducting a mixed-methods project investigating how game-based or playful learning with strongly situated components can influence first-year engineering students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and decision making. We have conducted preliminary analyses of first-year students' ethical reasoning and knowledge using the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT-2), Engineering Ethics Reasoning Instrument (EERI), and concept map assessment to characterize where students “are at” when they come to college, the results of which can be found in past ASEE publications. Additionally, we have developed a suite of ethics-driven classroom games that have been implemented and evaluated across three universities, engaging over 400 first-year engineering students. Now in its third year, we are modifying and (re)designing two of the game-based ethics interventions to (1) more accurately align with the ethical dilemmas in the EERI, (2) allow for more flexibility in modality of how the games are distributed to faculty and students, and (3) provide more variety in terms of the contexts of ethical dilemmas as well as types of dilemmas. As part of the continued development of the game-based ethical interventions, we are piloting a new assessment tool specific for playful learning in engineering ethics and aimed at measuring students ethical reasoning and thought process after they have played the game(s). The past year has provided insight into the potential limitations of the existing methods for measuring changes in ethical reasoning in students, as well as compared changes between first year and senior students. The last year has highlighted the situated or contextual nature of much of the ethical decision making that students do and incorporated both qualitative and quantitative methods. Further results from this investigation will provide the engineering education community with a set of impactful and research-based playful learning pedagogy and assessment that will help students confront social and ethical dilemmas in their professional lives. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2023.

AB  - Many science students struggle with using scientific language and making sense of scientific phenomena. Thus, there is an increased interest in science education research and public policy with regard to understanding and promoting scientific language use and sensemaking in science classrooms. However, there is a lack of comparative studies on how upper-secondary school students of different achievement and language levels use scientific language to make sense of phenomena. The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between achievement level, scientific language use, and sensemaking in chemistry for students being set a sensemaking task while constructing concept maps on the topic of chemical equilibrium. The concept maps were collected from five different upper-secondary schools in Sweden from two school systems (Swedish and International Baccalaureate). Using content analysis, these concept maps were examined for scientific language use as well as structuring of sensemaking. A majority of the students had difficulty structuring sensemaking in their concept maps, independently of achievement level. These difficulties included unstructured reasoning, symbolic representations being used as explanations, surface-level learning, and linear reasoning connected to rote learning. There appeared to be a connection between learning context and student individual structuring of sensemaking as expressed in the concept maps. The results also showed a clear relationship between scientific language use and achievement level in the student sample. The results indicate that the structuring of sensemaking and scientific language use are not always connected processes. In conclusion, teachers may need to adopt a teaching practice that includes directed and differentiated support for scientific sensemaking. © 2023, The Author(s).

AB  - Biological knowledge can be represented using different models textually and diagrammatically. One of the least explored diagrammatic methods for biological knowledge representation is concept map. In this paper, we present the growth in publications for concept map from 1974 to 2021 and attempt to capture the knowledge of phenomenon exhibited by the biological entity and represent its knowledge by information extraction for the use of designers in the bioinspired design process. A preliminary investigation has also been done to determine whether a causal mechanism can be found in the concept map. If yes, whether it is easy to abstract knowledge in a concept map or not. We also present the generic methodology to develop a concept map for any biological text with an example. To develop the concept map, biological knowledge is deconstructed from the text. Comparative text content analysis in biological text and concept has been done to know about redundancy. We then developed a completed concept map and assessed whether the participant understands the biological information without any intervention. The overall aim is to know whether knowledge can be captured and represented using concept maps for bioinspired design. This research aims to provide designers with a methodology to develop their own concept maps for biological entities. The overall goal is to foster meaningful learning and support bioinspired product design. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Improving the quality of the concept map affects the activation of Higher-Order Thinking. Various methods for manually evaluating the quality of concept maps have been developed. However, these methods can consume a substantial amount of time and burden teachers with a heavy workload. The Kit-Build concept map is a framework for learning that enables the automatic evaluation of concept maps. The prior study has proven that raising the concept map quality using the Kit-Build concept map affects learning achievement. However, the effect has yet to be investigated on Higher-Order Thinking activation. This study aimed to investigate the influence of the enhancement of concept map quality on Higher-Order Thinking stimulation in the Kit-Build concept map. The Higher-Order Thinking activation was measured from the student’s performance in solving the Higher-Order Thinking questions. This study also evaluated the validity of the concept map automated assessment in the Kit-Build concept map by comparing the assessment results of the method with the assessment results of the manual method. This study’s results suggested that improving the quality of concept maps by using the Kit-Build concept map could activate Higher-Order Thinking. The findings also showed that the automated assessment in the Kit-Build concept map was a promising tool that could be utilized to assess the quality of concept maps. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - The performance in biology at the secondary level has not been as good as expected. This has been a matter of concern. Thus, there has been a continuous focus on exploring newer innovative learner-centered and friendly instructional strategies to enhance understanding and retention in biology. This study, therefore, determined the effects of Concept Mapping (CM) and Cooperative Mastery Learning (CML) on fostering retention in photosynthesis among secondary schools in Nyamagabe district, Rwanda. A pre-test and post-test non-equivalent control group quasi-experimental design was used. Data were obtained from 151 students taught with CM, 144 students taught with CML, and 154 students taught with Conventional Teaching Methods (CTM). The Photosynthesis Retention Test (KR-21= 0.82) was used for data collection. The data were mainly analyze d using mean and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA). The results showed that the CM and CML treatment groups outperformed the CTM group in retention in photosynthesis. There was a statistically significant difference in favor of the CM between the two experimental groups. The male and female students taught using CM retained equally in photosynthesis while gender difference was revealed in the mean retention scores of the students exposed to the CML, with females retained significantly higher than males. The study concluded that the CM and CML strategies were more effective than CTM. It was suggested, among other things, that teachers should be encouraged to apply CM and CML strategies when teaching biology.  © 2022 The Author(s).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, providing access to the required information by clinical informationist (CI) is vital for clinical teams to make the best decision. This study was carried out to identifying how CIs should participate in grand round (GR). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is an action research study. It was conducted in the GR sessions of the Gastroenterology department of Al-Zahra Hospital affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2017. Participants included attending physicians, fellowship students of the Gastroenterology departments, a CI, and two supervising medical librarians. Data were collected through observation and discussion. Qualitative content analysis and concept mapping were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The findings indicated that existing problems were related to the CI, medical team, and infrastructural ones. The participation of the CI in medical team was arranged based on the following steps: planning, action, evaluation, and suggestions. It started from an initial diagnosis of patients and ended in GR meetings. During evaluation step, suggestions were made to remove the existing problems and in the fifth step, results were summarized and a framework for the participation of the CI in GR sessions was suggested. CONCLUSIONS: Medical team members were satisfied with the participation of the CI, but it is necessary to remove the existing structural and personal barriers (related to the CI and medical team members), in order to improve the efficiency of this participation. © 2021 EDP Sciences.

AB  - Ethics education has been recognized as increasingly important to engineering over the past two decades, although disagreement exists concerning how ethics can and should be taught in the classroom. With active learning strategies becoming a preferred method of instruction, a collaboration of authors from four universities (University of Pittsburgh, University of Connecticut, Rowan University and New Jersey Institute of Technology) are investigating how game-based or playful learning with strongly situated components can influence first-year engineering students' ethical knowledge, awareness, and decision making. This paper offers an overview and results of the progress to date of this three year, NSF Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) grant that aims to (1) characterize the ethical awareness and decision making of first-year engineering students, (2) develop game-based learning interventions focused on ethical decision making, and (3) determine how (and why) game-based approaches affect students' ethical awareness in engineering and the advantages of such approaches over non game-based approaches. Now in its second year, the authors have conducted a preliminary analysis of first-year students' ethical knowledge and organization via a concept mapping approach and have measured students' ethical reasoning using the Defining Issues Test 2 (DIT2) and Engineering Ethics Reasoning Instrument (EERI). Further, the authors have developed a suite of ethics-driven games that have been implemented across three of the universities, engaging over 400 first-year engineering students. Evaluation data has also been gathered for further game development and to assess initial student engagement and learning. Year 1 has provided insight into where first-year engineering students “are at” in terms of ethical knowledge and reasoning when they come to college, and how game-based instruction can be effective in the development of these students into moral agents who understand the consequences of their decisions. Further results from this investigation will provide the engineering education community with a set of impactful and research-based playful learning pedagogy and assessment that will help students confront social and ethical dilemmas in their professional lives. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022

AB  - Concept mapping (CM) can be an effective strategy to facilitate understanding-based learning of complex and abstract scientific content. In our study, we tried to answer two questions that have not yet been clarified: (1) How effective is CM if the learners do not have the textual learning material available when constructing their concept maps (retrieval setting) in contrast to when the material is available (elaboration setting)? (2) Do potential effects of the two settings depend on the intensity of a previous CM strategy training? To this end, we established a quasi-experimental four-group plan and collected data of N = 93 undergraduate students. The participants received either a detailed CM strategy training or just a short introduction and were then asked to apply CM in a retrieval or elaboration setting. The quality of constructed concept maps and content-related learning success were assessed to determine potential group differences. Overall, our results show a significantly positive but setting-independent effect of the CM strategy training on methodical CM skills. However, the different setting conditions differed neither regarding concept map quality nor content-related learning success, implying that CM in retrieval settings could be as effective as in elaboration settings. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Background and Objectives: The growing integration of healthcare sources is improving our understanding of diseases. Cross-mapping resources such as UMLS play a very important role in this area, but their coverage is still incomplete. With the aim to facilitate the integration and interoperability of biological, clinical and literary sources in studies of diseases, we built DisMaNET, a system to cross-map terms from disease vocabularies by leveraging the power and interpretability of network analysis. Methods: First, we collected and normalized data from 8 disease vocabularies and mapping sources to generate our datasets. Next, we built DisMaNET by integrating the generated datasets into a Neo4j graph database. Then we exploited the query mechanisms of Neo4j to cross-map disease terms of different vocabularies with a relevance score metric and contrasted the results with some state-of-the-art solutions. Finally, we made our system publicly available for its exploitation and evaluation both through a graphical user interface and REST APIs. Results: DisMaNET contains almost half a million nodes and near nine hundred thousand edges, including hierarchical and mapping relationships. Its query capabilities enabled the detection of connections between disease vocabularies that are not present in major mapping sources such as UMLS and the Disease Ontology, even for rare diseases. Furthermore, DisMaNET was capable of obtaining more than 80% of the mappings with UMLS reported in MonDO and DisGeNET, and it was successfully exploited to resolve the missing mappings in the DISNET project. Conclusions: DisMaNET is a powerful, intuitive and publicly available system to cross-map terms from different disease vocabularies. Our study proves that it is a competitive alternative to existing mapping systems, incorporating the potential of network analysis and the interpretability of the results through a visual interface as its main advantages. Expansion with new sources, versioning and the improvement of the search and scoring algorithms are envisioned as future lines of work. © 2021

AB  - Introduction UK higher education (HE) student numbers are increasing and students report higher levels of mental health and well-being issues. Social prescribing links individuals to community-based, non-medical support. It is widely implemented throughout the UK, and is supported by the Welsh Government. This protocol presents an evaluation of a new social prescribing service to enhance student well-being, a first for UK HE students. Methods and analysis A realist evaluation to articulate why, how and to what extent and circumstances social prescribing works for students, using a mixed-methods sequential design of four cycles. Cycle 1 informs the model and programme theory development of how the model works; activities include a Realist Review, Group Concept Mapping and producing bilingual short films about the evaluation and model. Cycle 2 involves secondary analysis of routine service data, and outcome measurements from students receiving a social prescription. Cycle 3 uses reflective diaries and qualitative realist interviews with stakeholders to understand the process and outcome of the model. Cycle 4 concludes with a world café workshop with stakeholders to agree and finalise the framework specification of € how, why, when and to what extent' the model works.

AB  - We proposed and evaluated a new approach (“Farm-school project”) to develop children's awareness about the role of people in agricultural production and environmental quality. The materialization of the “Farm-school” project was performed by a theoretical-practical 4-hour visit at an experimental farm. 240 Elementary school students were evaluated through concept maps and drawings, before and after the visit. There was a conceptual evolution in concept maps of 41 and 82%, and an increased number of categories per drawing of 23% and 37%. In concept maps, students did not relate people to the different spheres of agricultural production before the farm visit, but after, people became the main element. After the visit, students began to portray not only productive aspects in their drawings but also processes involving production, such as soil conservation practices and maintenance of mulch for soil cover. With the population concentrated in urban areas, there is a lack of contact with the rural landscape, generating a distorted view of food systems and rural land use, which affects social drivers and pro-environmental behavior. This imposes an educational task on governments to bring about information on agricultural production to elementary school students. We have proven the effectiveness of the “Farm-School” project as a low-cost educational policy alternative and a tool to increase children’s awareness about the role of people in agricultural production and environmental quality since students come to a better understanding of where food comes from and how it is produced. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - This research study investigated conceptions about buoyancy held by 55 elementary preservice teachers enrolled in a science methods course who participated in an instructional intervention designed to increase their knowledge about buoyancy. Pre- and post-concept maps were analyzed using a paired sample t test and thematic analysis was used to interpret narratives, drawings, and interview data. There was a statistically significant difference (t = −3.504, p =.001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD =.879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The total number of accurate propositions increased between the pre- and post-concept maps. The drawings revealed that most participants (66%) had alternative conceptions about how gravity is related to buoyancy and the role it plays in floating and sinking. Data from the interviews triangulated with other data sources that showed gains in scientific conceptions such as opposing forces (53%) and surface area (33%), while documenting the persistence of serious alternative conceptions about floating and sinking (49%), the key role of fluid density (56%), and density of an object (62%). © 2021, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - Humor is considered an educational method that can be implemented in educational processes with a wide range of educational variables. Examining the scope of research on educational humor has the potential to guide future studies. Therefore, the aim of this study is to show the conceptual trend in humor research in education over the past decade. 989 publications on the subject of humor in education were analyzed using the text mining method. A text analytic tool was used for the analysis, and the titles, abstracts, and keywords were included in the text analytics. As a result of the study, humor was studied in terms of various variables in different educational fields. In addition, the reflections of humor in education base on technological developments and the target groups applied were also revealed. The findings revealed the conceptual relationships and concept maps by year. It was concluded that the concept of humor in educational research is particularly related to the variables of motivation, attention, skill, creativity, engagement, and interest. Upon comparing 2010 and 2019, it has been observed that concepts related to online education, science, collaborative learning, and technology in humor studies have spread in recent years. In addition, humor has also emerged as a research phenomenon in language, health, and science education. © 2021, Ozgen Korkmaz. All rights reserved.

AB  - While the use of technology in education has been rapidly increasing worldwide, the diversity and availability of information and study materials have been increasing at an even faster rate. However, presenting and explaining key course concepts in an effective and organized manner, as well as involving students in interactive learning experiences, are still key parts of teaching in higher education, more specifically, in achieving the educational objectives in the fundamental courses of science and engineering programs. Keeping this in prime consideration, the use of concept maps in basic engineering courses has been very effective and has gained growing attention in recent years. This work studied the use of a concept map in an undergraduate dynamics class. A two-phase hierarchical approach was used to construct two concept maps which were then demonstrated in the beginning of the course to allow students to see the key points of the entire course. The concept maps took the form of trees, with topics branching up from two broad topic areas at the bottom: dynamics of particles and dynamics of rigid bodies. The entire tree was climbed up as the course progressed. The students were asked to build their own concept map at the end of the semester with the goal of stimulating creativity as delineated by constructivism in contemporary pedagogy. A survey was carried out at the end of the course to study student perceptions of using the concept map. While students expressed different opinions on several questions, 100% of the participant students responded “I agree” to the survey item “The concept map was a useful resource for in-class activities”. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.

AB  - Objective: A bibliometric analysis of COVID-19 is conducted to examine the developmental context, research hotspots, and frontiers of mental health. Methods: Using the Web of Science Core Collection (WOSCC), we have retrieved articles on mental health research related to COVID-19 which were published between 2019 and 2021. The coauthorship of countries, institutes, and authors was analyzed using VOSviewer 1.6.17, and the co-citation map of authors/references was analyzed as well. CiteSpace version 5.8.R3 was used to analyze keyword clusters and forecast research frontiers. Results: There were 8,856 articles retrieved, including 10,559 research institutes and 1,407 academic journals. The most published country and institutes were the United States (2190) and the University of London (373). Wang, Chengyu owned the highest co-citations (1810). Frontier topics can be identified by trending keywords, including “anxiety,” “depression,” “psychological distress,” “quarantine,” “post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),” “insomnia,” and “Healthcare workers.” Conclusion: The most common psychological problems of people during the epidemic are anxiety and depression. Insomnia and PTSD need to be solved under the normalization of the epidemic. GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scales are the most convenient and effective for screening anxiety and depression. Healthcare workers, older adults, and college students should be concerned, and social and family support is essential. Copyright © 2022 Zhou, Lin, Xu, Lin and Wu.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the impact of years of experience and field of expertise on the development of chemistry knowledge structures from STEM experts comprising 103 professors, 10 postdocs, and 146 doctoral students. Of these participants, 127 were specialized in chemistry and the rest were from various science and engineering disciplines. Although most participants were part of a research university located in Northern California, the pool included a small group of experts from different universities and countries. The main source of the data was a Word Association Test generated with 17 keywords that refer to major topics or concepts commonly introduced in the general chemistry curricula. The knowledge structures were examined to determine if the contents and the orientations of the clusters varied between the expert groups. In addition, their analysis was enriched with the consideration of chemistry triplet designations and central terms identified by eccentricity values on each structure. The overall expert knowledge structure generated in this study was also compared to undergraduate structures determined by using the same instrument and methodology. The investigation of the structures revealed several differences between expert groups and provided insight into the transformation of novices into experts. The paper also presents practical suggestions for educators on how to utilize structures while teaching, informing their instructional practices, and reforming teaching materials. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

AB  - Background This study aimed to use a concept mapping methodology to develop a European framework of the needs of parents/guardians (P/G) for supporting athletes combining sport and education (dual career, DC). Methods By means of a concept mapping methodology, 337 French, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, and Slovenian parents sorted and rated 80 potential statements associated to parenting DC athletes. Results Five distinct clusters emerged: 1. P/G' roles, needs and awareness to support athletes, including 22 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2-4.2 pt); 2. Requirements for effective planning of DC pathway, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2-4.5 pt); 3. Educational opportunity, including 13 statements (mean:3.5; range: 3.1-4.0 pt); 4. Policy and provision for DC, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.1-4.2 pt); and 5. Athletes' lifestyle & self-management, including 7 statements (mean:4.0; range: 3.5-4.5 pt). Estimates of effect size (Partial eta-squared) were calculated for ANOVAs to assess the degree of variability on the statement importance ranking as the dependent variable accounted for by the demographic data. The concept mapping showed good validity (stress value: 0.11) and high reliability (rSHT: 0.99, rSHM: 0.98; rRR:0.98). One-third of the statements indicated differences (p<0.05) in relation to the P/Gs' gender and the athletes' education level, competition level and sport typology. Conclusion In synthesizing the opinions, experience and needs of P/Gs of DC athletes the present framework provided sound theoretical underpinnings to inform the development of an online educational programme for empowering parenting DC athletes (https://edu.empatiasport. eu/eng/), as well as be a foundation for future Pan-European DC research on how these statements interact with each other, in different European contexts. © 2021 Varga et al.

AB  - Scholars and researchers generally believe that scientific inquiry is an important activity for cultivating students' applied knowledge and high-level thinking ability. The process of scientific inquiry can promote students' learning motivation and trigger their higher-order thinking ability. However, students may not have enough prior knowledge or they may lack inquiry experience, which may influence the effectiveness of their inquiry learning. Besides, in a scientific inquiry environment assisted by technology, students must face abundant and diverse learning resources, and may not effectively organize and carry out advanced cogitation to solve problems. Therefore, this research proposed an integrated concept mapping and image recognition (IR) approach to help students effectively acquire and organize knowledge in the process of scientific inquiry. This study applied a quasi-experimental design to verify the effect of this proposed approach. The experimental group conducted the concept mapping-based IR (CM-IR) learning approach, whilst the control group conducted the conventional IR-based learning approach to evaluate the students' performance in terms of their learning motivation and learning achievements. The participants were two classes of 10th-grade students in northern Taiwan. One was the experimental group with 22 students, whilst the other was the control group with 22 students. The experimental results show that the students learning with the CM-IR learning approach had better learning achievement, attitudes and intrinsic motivation, as well as higher mental load than those learning with the conventional IR-based learning approach. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided for future research in this field. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic With the development of information technology, AI has attracted the attention of researchers. Image recognition (IR) is one of the AI applications, and has been used to support learning in various educational fields. Researchers have indicated that concept mapping is an effective instructional strategy and promotes students' knowledge construction. What this paper adds A concept mapping-based IR (CM-IR) learning approach is proposed to improve students' scientific inquiry performance. A quasi-experimental design was conducted with 10th-grade students on the ‘Plant identification’ unit of the scientific inquiry course. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve students' learning achievement, learning motivation and learning attitude. Implications for practice and/or policy The CM-IR learning approach could be an effective method to facilitate students' learning performances and motivation in scientific inquiry. It is worth promoting the CM-IR learning approach in school settings since it is low-cost and enables learning anywhere using mobile devices. Scholars and educators are encouraged to work on how AI technologies applications can be applied to support learning. © 2021 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Summary: While oncology social workers are the primary providers of psychosocial services, they vary in what they do and how they work across different cancer care settings. Standards of Practice suggest that there exists a core or universal set of activities and tasks that are grounded in the values and principles of social work and apply across all settings. The purpose of this study was to identify activities that delineate and distinguish Competencies, Opportunities, Roles and Expertise (CORE) for oncology social work. Research was conducted using Concept Mapping, a structured and prescribed approach to collecting, analyzing, and interpreting qualitative and quantitative data while engaging stakeholders in the research process. Findings: An expert panel of oncology social work practitioners, academicians, and leaders in the field (n = 35) generated 91 practice behaviors that were subject to card sorting and ratings of importance. A visual map consisting of six clusters best represented the statistical fit of the data (stress value = 0.18) while maintaining the most meaningful categorization of individual statements. These six domains were as follows: Clinical Assessment and Intervention (38 items; mean importance = 3.31); Professional Advocacy and Political Action (5 items; mean importance = 3.03); Case Management and Care Coordination (16 items; mean importance = 3.02); Patient Education and Advocacy (8 items; mean importance = 2.82); Organizational Support and Service (12 items; mean importance = 2.74); Professional Education (12 items; mean importance = 2.45). Application: These results may inform initiatives related to social work education and training, credentialing and certification, health policy, research and advocacy on behalf of patients, families, communities, and the profession. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students’ vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students’ vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - This article critically discusses the ecology of public schools in the United States: systemic barriers and associated biases that permeate these learning contexts and derail efforts to close opportunity gaps for African American adolescents with emotional and behavioral challenges. Using results from a mixed-methods study, we illustrate the ubiquity of an a-developmental perspective that guides perceptions of what is needed to keep these students in and successful at school. A close examination of school mental health providers’ perceptions of what is important and feasible in public school contexts shows recommended interventions to be necessary but not sufficient. We highlight important considerations in the reframing of schools as a dynamic developmental system and conclude with recommendations about how to harness adolescents’ strengths to generate strategies that move us toward more equitable and socially just schooling. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2022.

AB  - An intelligent tutoring system (ITS) provides personalized instructions and feedback to learners without requiring expert intervention. One of the components of an ITS is the domain modeling module where the system stores the dependencies between the concepts in the domain using a concept map. These concept dependencies are used by an ITS to determine how to sequence the teaching of concepts to a student and as a representation of student knowledge. This requires an expert to manually find concepts in the domain and enter the dependencies between concepts. We aim to automate the process of domain modeling by finding relationships among concepts in a domain. One such type of relationship is a prerequisite relationship which represents the learning order of a pair of concepts. Determining prerequisite relationships helps in developing an effective concept map for an ITS. These relationships can be extracted by finding patterns between occurrences of the concepts in the text. We propose a method “Prerequisite Relationship Extraction using Position-biased burst analysis” (PREP) based on burst analysis to determine prerequisite relationships between the concepts present in unstructured text using the order of occurrence of concepts. We have evaluated the proposed method using textbooks spanning multiple domains like data mining, geometry, precalculus, and physics to test its robustness. The proposed method results in as much as a 17% improvement in precision over existing methods. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative study conducted using the Glaserian grounded theory (GT) method. Glaser’s approach to GT differs from Strauss and Corbin’s method, which is more widespread. There are some differences in the focus on participants’ concerns, staying in the research environment for an extended period to discover participants’ main concerns and the emergence of a basic social process around the core category. The Glaserian GT method was used to understand elite athletes’ lifestyles. Two groups of athletes and non-athletes were recruited for the interview as the sample. The core category was determined through iterative coding, memoing, theoretical sampling, and theoretical sorting. There were overlaps in these phases; they fluctuated back and forth and were not as clear-cut as they could be. Results showed the lifestyle components of elite athletes. Besides identifying participants’ main concerns, the results also demonstrated how to address them over time. It is a category of a basic social process named “professionalizing.” Lastly, the steps of creating a concept map are explained practically, which in addition to sports science scholars, can be considered by researchers in other fields. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students’ learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine. The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater than that of students who used the Google search engine. This illustrates that the agent effectively filtered computer science articles, and DACMs helped students gain a deeper understanding of academic concepts and knowledge related to artificial intelligence. © 2022

AB  - Background: Ongoing developments in medical education recognize the move to curricula that support self-regulated learning processes, skills of thinking, and the ability to adapt and navigate uncertain situations as much as the knowledge base of learners. Difficulties encountered in pursuing this reform, especially for pharmacology, include the tendency of beginner learners not to ask higher-order questions and the potential incongruency between creating authentic spaces for self-directed learning and providing external expert guidance. We tested the feasibility of developing, implementing, and sustaining an innovative model of social pedagogy as a strategy to address these challenges. Methods: Constructivism, communities of practice, and networked learning theory were selected as lenses for development of the model. Three hundred sixty-five first-year medical students participated between 2014 and 2018; they were introduced to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics via 15 online modules that each included: learning objectives, a clinical vignette, teaching video, cumulative concept map, and small group wiki assignment. Five-person communities organized around the 15 wiki assignments were a key component where learners answered asynchronous, case-based questions that touched iteratively on Bloom’s cognitive taxonomy levels. The social pedagogy model’s wiki assignments were explored using abductive qualitative data analysis. Results: Qualitative analysis revealed that learners acquired and applied a conceptual framework for approaching pharmacology as a discipline, and demonstrated adaptive mastery by evaluating and interacting competently with unfamiliar drug information. Learners and faculty acquired habits of self-directed assessment seeking and learner-centered coaching, respectively; specifically, the model taught learners to look outward to peers, faculty, and external sources of information for credible and constructive feedback, and that this feedback could be trusted as a basis to direct performance improvement. 82–94% of learners rated the social pedagogy-based curriculum valuable. Conclusions: This social pedagogy model is agnostic with regard to pharmacology and type of health professional learner; therefore, we anticipate its benefits to be transferable to other disciplines. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Critical thinking, a rational and open higher-order thinking mode in human cognition, is becoming imperative to success in modern life. Therefore, cultivating students' critical thinking has become a common goal of education reform worldwide. Teachers play a crucial role in cultivating students' critical thinking. However, existing studies have paid little attention to teachers, especially middle school teachers' knowledge and understanding of critical thinking. Therefore, this study aimed to explore the perspectives of ten Chinese middle school chemistry teachers on critical thinking using concept maps, thinking aloud, and in-depth interviews based on concept maps. Results showed that most of the teachers believed that critical thinking means reflection and questioning and requires evidence awareness. All teachers had a positive attitude towards critical thinking and believed that it can promote evidence awareness, problem solving, decision making, teaching evaluation, logic, and systematisation. Teachers recognised that critical thinking can be taught, and the major factors affecting the development of students' critical thinking were the environment, students themselves, teachers, evaluation, subject characteristics, and types of knowledge. Several strategies for developing students' critical thinking in chemistry teaching were proposed, including setting diversified and different types of chemistry courses, developing controversial curriculum themes in real situations, and implementing experimental, project-based, problem solving, and history-based teaching. In addition, this study showed that teachers and students promoted the development of critical thinking within one another. Further, this study demonstrated an effective methodology for probing individual subjective thoughts. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023.

AB  - Purpose: This article presents a case study exploring how future teachers combine scientific knowledge and practical knowledge during a history didactics course and practicum field experience in history teaching in Quebec high schools. Design: Through a thematic analysis of the written assignments submitted during the practicum and conceptual maps designed as part of the didactics course, links between theory and practice are highlighted. Results: Future teachers’ referring to different types of knowledge depends on the expectations specified for each written assignment, and shows discourse with little critical distance. However, the concept maps show a more complex representation of teaching practices which can be explained by both the didactics course and the experiential and practical knowledge gained through the practicum. Implications: This composite of experiences puts initial teacher training into perspective along a continuum that requires consolidating university expectations and varying school practices. Closer collaboration is needed between the different actors involved in both theoretical courses and practical training.

AB  - Students' low performance in biology perturbs many teachers and other stakeholders. This has sparked research into learning strategies that might be utilized to improve students’ performance in the subject. This study investigated the effects of Concept Mapping (CM) and Cooperative Mastery Learning (CML) on students' achievement in photosynthesis. A pre-test, post-test, non-equivalent control group, quasi-experimental design was used. A sample of 449 students was drawn from the population of 6,708 senior two secondary students (SS2) in Nyamagabe district, Rwanda. Photosynthesis Achievement Test (PAT) (KR-21 = .82), Attitude Towards Concept Mapping Questionnaire (ATCMQ), and Attitude Towards Cooperative Mastery Learning Questionnaire (ATCMLQ) were used for data collection. Data were analyzed mainly using mean and standard deviation, Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), and t-test. Findings revealed that the students who were exposed to the CM and CML attained significantly higher mean achievement scores in the PAT than those exposed to Conventional Teaching Methods (CTM) (F (2, 445) = 385.242, p<0.05). The CM group students achieved significantly better than the CML group. Moreover, there was no significant interaction effect between instructional strategies and gender in achievement (F (2, 442) =. 344, p > .05). The students showed a significant and positive attitudes towards the use of CM over the use of CM (t=5.8, p<.05). Thus, the CM and CML are effective strategies for successful and meaningful photosynthesis learning. It was recommended among other things that the biology teachers should use the CM and CML to enhance students’ achievement in biology especially in difficult and abstract concepts like photosynthesis. ©Authors

AB  - Research on the physics learning of electric charge has been carried out using MR-SR (Multiple Representation and Semiotic Resources). The research aims to find out the outcomes of student learning using the PIMCA learning model (Presentation, Idea Mapping, Conceptualization, and Assessment formative) introduced and developed by Cosmas Poluakan. The research was conducted at the Department of Physics, Manado State University, with 22 pre-service teacher students as respondents using the One Group Pre-test-Post-test Design. The instruments used in the form of pre-test and post-test which have been tested and validated. The research implementation stage starts from the pre-test, and then the implementation of physics learning follows the 4 steps of the PIMCA model. The results of data processing and analysis obtained an average pre-test score is 18,88 and an average post-test score is 75,16. There was an increase in concept mastery. In the idea mapping stage only 2 concepts are correct to drafting concept mapping, 6 are correct from 10 concepts that were used as references. PIMCA MR-SR learning model is very effective in helping students find and understand the correct concepts of physics. The use of the PIMCA MR-SR as a new model in the teaching and learning process is very effective in learning physics, mathematics and science or in the STEM area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a valuable learning experience for a feedback provider. However, different types of products require different types of feedback, which, in turn, may lead to different learning outcomes. The current study investigates the effect on the learning of feedback providers of reviewing different types of products. Secondary school students (n =127) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: giving peer feedback on either concept maps or answers to open-ended test questions. Both types of product, created by the researchers, were comparable with regard to content: they included the same misconceptions and were both of average quality. Giving peer feedback was part of a chemistry lesson delivered in an online inquiry learning environment. Students’ post-test scores, their own learning products, and the quality of the provided feedback were analysed to check for an effect on learning. There was no difference in post-test scores between the conditions, but the quality of the provided feedback predicted post-test scores. This indicates that it is not the type of product reviewed that matters, but the effort that students put into giving feedback. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Concept mapping (CM) is widely used in educational settings as a teaching/learning or assessment tool. We conducted a bibliometric analysis and systematic review to provide an updated review on CM research in computer-supported learning environments. A total of 356 selected studies published from 1990 to 2020 were analyzed from the Web of Science database. The findings revealed an increasing and continuous focus on CM research. The leading journal for publishing CM research was Computers & Education, and the United States was the country with the most published studies. The most frequently used keywords were categorized into four clusters to represent the four main themes of CM research. Subsequent analysis showed that the most applied learning subject was environmental science or natural science; traditional computers/devices were the most used devices/hardware; higher education students were the most used samples; quantitative methods were the most used research methods; computers as mindtools were the most adopted learning strategy; and concept mapping assessment was the most used measurement tool in the CM research. These findings reveal the trends of CM research and provide future research directions and applications of practical education for researchers and educators. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts’ concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9–16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students’ knowledge more thoroughly. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Learning is both guided by and constrained by the features of the external representation (ER) used for developing conceptual understanding. This work uses a case-study design to study three groups of 5 pre-college biology students (n=15) who used three different ERs- concept-map, symbolic model and molecular model, to perform tasks related to the structure of the DNA (Deoxyribonucleic acid) molecule. A descriptive synthesis analysis of students' diagrams revealed ER-specific changes in their conceptual knowledge. © ISLS.

AB  - Objective: To combine machine efficiency and human intelligence for converting complex clinical trial eligibility criteria text into cohort queries. Materials and Methods: Criteria2Query (C2Q) 2.0 was developed to enable real-Time user intervention for criteria selection and simplification, parsing error correction, and concept mapping. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score of enhanced modules for negation scope detection, temporal and value normalization were evaluated using a previously curated gold standard, the annotated eligibility criteria of 1010 COVID-19 clinical trials. The usability and usefulness were evaluated by 10 research coordinators in a task-oriented usability evaluation using 5 Alzheimer's disease trials. Data were collected by user interaction logging, a demographic questionnaire, the Health Information Technology Usability Evaluation Scale (Health-ITUES), and a feature-specific questionnaire. Results: The accuracies of negation scope detection, temporal and value normalization were 0.924, 0.916, and 0.966, respectively. C2Q 2.0 achieved a moderate usability score (3.84 out of 5) and a high learnability score (4.54 out of 5). On average, 9.9 modifications were made for a clinical study. Experienced researchers made more modifications than novice researchers. The most frequent modification was deletion (5.35 per study). Furthermore, the evaluators favored cohort queries resulting from modifications (score 4.1 out of 5) and the user engagement features (score 4.3 out of 5). Discussion and Conclusion: Features to engage domain experts and to overcome the limitations in automated machine output are shown to be useful and user-friendly. We concluded that human-computer collaboration is key to improving the adoption and user-friendliness of natural language processing. © The Author(s) 2022.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to determine the role of knowledge mapping in the organisation for the development of the learning environment of employees. The study is based on the review, analysis and synthesis of scientific information from the data-bases Academic Search Elite, RUL, COBISS.si, Google Scholar and EBSCOhost. The key search terms were: management, knowledge management, knowledge maps, map/knowledge matrix and knowledge management in English and Slovenian, and the period from 2008 to 2020. The restrictive search criteria were: 2008 to 2020 and the full text of articles. 41 articles were included in the detailed processing, of which 9 quantitative and 14 qualitative studies were included in the final analysis. 7 codes were identified: mind map, folder of concepts, folder of possessed knowledge, folder of work processes, folder of competences, explicit knowledge, tacit knowledge. Research has shown that organisations use knowledge-mapping methods for the development of the learning environment in work processes to a lesser extent. These methods would help them to better accumulate all the knowledge, thus in-creasing the innovation, performance and competitive-ness of employees in an increasingly dynamic market. © 2022, Pedagoska Obzorja d.o.o.

AB  - Contemporary early childhood research investigates ways of extending children’s scientific understanding and knowing in the world around them. The current study followed an innovative approach, adopting the design thinking model of IDEO to promote and deepen children’s scientific thinking and understanding of the ‘water cycle’. Digital technologies such as concept map software, simulations, interactive whiteboard and others, were also successfully integrated and played a significant role in the whole process. A total of 61 children from three Greek kindergartens participated in the study (33 boys and 28 girls) and their mean age was 5.2 years. Teachers’ diaries of the activities following the IDEO phases, digital recordings of children’s responses, drawings and concept maps were utilised for the documentation of the teaching intervention. The results revealed that the IDEO model was very helpful and contributed to reaching positive learning outcomes. Children were active participants throughout the intervention and their scientific knowledge was enhanced. Future research with a design thinking framework in exploring science in early childhood education settings is strongly recommended by also successfully integrating digital tools. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

AB  - In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based net-works. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins’ input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human-and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Providing immediate feedback to students of their level of understanding of a concept is important for effective learning and for the instructor to decide to either review the concept or move forward to another. This paper demonstrates concept mapping and a student response system to provide immediate feedback in an Electrical Circuits course. We showed how students' learning is improved when they receive immediate online feedback about their state of learning from their peers and the instructor. The same course was taught differently in two consecutive years, one with immediate feedback and concept mapping and the other without. The assessment of the impact on students learning using immediate online feedback and concept mapping presented through the student grades for the same course in the two years. The results showed that immediate feedback and concept mapping have a significant and positive effect on student performance. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Previous research has illustrated the potential of flipped learning for assisting teachers in designing meaningful activities to promote students’ higher order thinking skills; however, several previous studies have challenged the effects of flipped learning on students’ learning. One of the key problems is the lack of an effective learning approach or tools to engage students in the flipped learning activity. In this study, a concept mapping-based Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE) approach was incorporated into flipped learning (called CPOE-FL) to enhance students’ scientific learning. Furthermore, a three-group experiment was conducted to assess the effects of the three flipped learning models, comprising the CPOE-FL approach, the POE-FL (incorporating POE into flipped learning) approach, and the C-FL (conventional flipped learning) approach. The experimental results displayed that the CPOE-FL approach can benefit the learning achievements and self-efficacy of the students with respectively lower prior knowledge and lower initial self-efficacy, in comparison with the POE-FL and C-FL approaches. Both the CPOE-FL and POE-FL approaches promoted the students’ inner learning motivation, while the CPOE-FL approach enhanced the students’ critical thinking. This proposed approach could provide a good reference for researchers or school teachers intending to implement POE-based flipped learning in the future. © 2022, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - With the rapid development of mobile learning technologies as well as relevant hardware and software platforms, there is a bright prospect for mixed reality (MR) applying in the field of education. However, appropriate knowledge navigation and concept arrangement methods are urgent to diminish students' cognitive load in the virtual learning environment. In this preliminary study, concept maps were selected as scaffolding tools to help students navigate through the MR learning space, and an educational game prototype named MMRCM integrating MR and concept maps was developed to investigate students' technology acceptance about it. Considering the novelty of this new type of MR application, an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was constructed with the MR game design elements and the concept map usefulness as external factors. A middle school physics experiment using MMRCM was conducted to help students learn the abstract concepts of friction. The evaluation results showed that the model's external factors have significant correlations with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The findings indicated explicit intention to use MMRCM, which implied that MR gaming and concept maps could be integrated as an effective instructional tool in science education.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Each clinical encounter demands competent clinical skills and expertise from a student nurse. This period also becomes the most challenging as many have trouble linking theory with practice. Thus, they experience less confidence at the bedside of patients. Delivering high-quality, safe nursing care at the bedside requires sound clinical judgement. Nurses with clinical judgement have evidence-based knowledge enabling them to identify intuitively and quickly the salient patient care information and respond accordingly. Developing these critical clinical judgement abilities takes time, and many new nurses lack them. Concept mapping is a robust instructional technique that may assist a novice nurse in making links between many aspects of nursing care concepts, allowing for the development of clinical judgement. A concept map is a visual resource that organises and displays a student’s understanding of the links between distinct concepts for a particular subject. Most of the earlier studies were done in the simulation lab. Little evidence exists to claim that clinical judgement has improved over time due to applying concept mapping techniques in the clinical setting. This study aimed to determine the usefulness of the concept mapping approach to foster clinical judgement among nursing students in Bangalore, India. A quantitative, quasi-experimental pretest-post-test design with a control group was implemented among Bachelor of Science in Nursing students. The subjects were undergoing medical-surgical nursing courses in four nursing colleges in an urban setting. The allocation of four colleges to the control and experimental group was random. A sample size of 300 participants completed a questionnaire on baseline characteristics and the Lasater Clinical Judgement Rubric. The experimental group was taught using the concept mapping technique, and participants prepared a concept map for their assigned patient in the clinical area. The intervention group’s mean pretest clinical judgement score was 18.24 (SD = 3.17), while the control group’s was 20.18 (SD = 4.85). The intervention group’s mean post-test clinical judgement score (29.56, SD = 5.42) is greater than the control group’s (22.33, SD = 4.63). The experimental group had a substantially higher post-test clinical judgement score (t = 3.99, P<0.001) than the control group. The findings imply that concept mapping will help nursing students improve their clinical judgement abilities. © Unisa Press 2022.

AB  - Background: Few validated assessment tools are available to increase understanding and measure factors associated with sustainment of clinical practices, an increasingly recognized need among clinicians. We describe the development of the Clinical Sustainability Assessment Tool (CSAT), designed to assess factors that contribute to sustainable practices in clinical settings. Methods: Sixty-four participants from clinical and research fields participated in concept mapping and were recruited to brainstorm factors that lead to sustained clinical practices. Once repeated factors were removed, participants sorted items based on similarity and rated them by importance and feasibility. Using concept mapping analyses, items were grouped into meaningful domains to develop an initial tool. We then recruited pilot sites and early adopters, for a total of 286 practicing clinicians, to pilot and evaluate the tool. Individuals were recruited from clinical settings across pediatric and adult medical and surgical subspecialties. The data were analyzed using confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to test hypothesized subscale structure in the instrument. We used root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) and the standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) to assess fit and thus the ability of CSAT to measure the identified domains. Results: The concept mapping produced sorted statements that were edited into items that could be responded to, resulting in the creation of a tool with seven determinant domains and 47 items. The pilot and CFA testing resulted in a final CSAT instrument made up 35 items, five per domain. CFA results demonstrated very good fit of the seven domain structure of the CSAT (RMSEA = 0.049; SRMR = 0.049). Usability testing indicated the CSAT is brief, easy to use, easy to learn, and does not require extensive training. Additionally, the measure scored highly (18/20) on the Psychometric and Pragmatic Evidence Rating Scale (PAPERS). The seven final CSAT domains were engaged staff and leadership, engaged stakeholders, organizational readiness, workflow integration, implementation and training, monitoring and evaluation, and outcomes and effectiveness. Conclusions: The CSAT is a new reliable assessment tool which allows for greater practical and scientific understanding of contextual factors that enable sustainable clinical practices over time. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Neuroimaging provides a relatively new approach for advancing engineering education by exploring changes in neurocognition from educational interventions. The purpose of the research described in this paper is to present the results of a preliminary study that measured students' neurocognition while concept mapping. Engineering design is an iterative process of exploring both the problem and solution spaces. To aid students in exploring these spaces, half of the 66 engineering students who participated in the study were first asked to develop a concept map and then construct a design problem statement. The concept mapping activity significantly reduced neurocognitive activation in the students' left prefrontal cortex (PFC) compared to students who did not receive this intervention when constructing their problem statement. The sub-region in the left PFC that elicited less activation is generally associated with analytical judgment and goal-directed planning. The group of students who completed the concept mapping activity had greater focused neurocognitive activation in their right PFC. The right PFC is often associated with divergent thinking and ill-structured representation. Patterns of functional connectivity across students' PFC also differed between the groups. The concept mapping activity reduced the network density in students' PFC. Lower network density is one measure of lower cognitive effort. These results provide new insight into the neurocognition of engineering students when designing and how educational interventions can change engineering students' neurocognition. A better understanding of how interventions like concept mapping shape students' neurocognition, and how this relates to learning, can lay the groundwork for novel advances in engineering education that support new tools and pedagogy for engineering design. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.

AB  - Magnetic lubricants are usually petroleum-based, but not renewable and cannot be environmentally degraded. It can cause the environmental problems. Magnetic lubricants based on ionic liquids can be environmental friendly. The ionic liquid lubricants are synthesized from vegetable oil fatty acids, which is a locally sustainable and renewable sources. This molecular engineering can be used to integrate the concept of sustainability into teaching and learning. This study aimed to obtain the concept map and teaching learning sequence (TLS) from the scientist's conception. The method used is a qualitative content analysis (literature analysis type), using an instrument in the form of a content analysis format. The first phase begins with collecting literatures in the form of textbooks, monographs, review results and research articles. The next phase is descriptive analysis, selecting categories, and evaluating the material didactically. This research produces the concept map, TLS and clarified chemical concepts. The scientist's conception obtained is the application, function, characteristics of media magnetic lubricants, ionic liquids and examples of magnetic lubricants based on ionic liquids. Concept map and TLS can illustrate the relationship between one concept and another. They also show the relationship between science, technology and engineering. The results can be used as the basis for the preparation of teaching materials and didactical designs for teaching and learning. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explores whether learning approaches combining augmented reality and multidimensional concept maps (ARMCMs) would improve learning effectiveness, learning motivation, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load more than multidimensional concept maps (MCMs) and augmented reality (AR) learning do. The study employed a quasi-experimental design, and the subjects were 93 students from an elementary school in Taiwan. By dividing the students into ARMCMs group, MCMs group, and AR group, the results show that the learning with ARMCMs can provide better promotion on learning motivation and positive influences on learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load. © 2021, De La Salle University.

AB  - This paper presents an experimental study conducted on employing Active Learning strategies towards enhancing the attainment of learning outcomes of a course "Linear Control Systems" in the undergraduate (UG) Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) programme. The existing UG programme curriculum is retrofitted into outcome-based curriculum. The Programme Outcomes (POs) for this programme are derived from the Graduate Attributes of Washington Accord (WA). In order to meet the POs, Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs) are written predominantly in the Cognitive (Revised Bloom's taxonomy) and Psychomotor (Dave's taxonomy) domains for lecture-based courses and laboratory courses, respectively and very few are written in Affective (Bloom's taxonomy) domain. In this paper, four CLOs (i) Discuss the various classification of control systems (K2), (ii) Define the time and frequency response of the system (K2), (iii) Derive the overall transfer function of the given Block diagram of a system (K3) and (iv) Derive the overall transfer function of a Signal Flow Graph (SFG) of a system (K3) are considered to measure the effectiveness of active learning methods in attaining the outcome. Active learning methods such as Jigsaw, Think-pair-share and Peer instruction, and traditional lecture-based methods were employed. In addition, ClassComm software with student interactive devices was used to measure the students' learning in the classroom and subsequently the attainment of CLOs. This study compares the effectiveness of active learning methods with the traditional lecture-based instruction method in relation to the attainment of CLOs. The overall analysis results reveal that both instructors and students received the active learning methods very well, and they are very effective in enhancing the attainment of learning outcomes. However, instructors are of the view that the duration of the contact period should be at least two hours. © 2022, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Students’ performance in biology in Rwanda National Examinations has been reported to be unsatisfactory. This demands teachers to shift to methods that enable students to acquire meaningful learning. In an attempt to cope with this situation, the effects of concept mapping (CM) and cooperative mastery learning (CML) on the cognitive process in biology among lower secondary school students in Nyamagabe district, Rwanda was investigated. A quasi-experimental non-equivalent pre-test, post-test control group design was applied to a sample of 449 senior secondary school two (SS2) students (224 males and 225 females) drawn from seven co-educational secondary schools purposively selected from 46 schools. The students were in CM (n=151), CML (n=144) and conventional teaching method (CTM) (n=154) groups. The biology Achievement Test with a reliability of 0.82 obtained from the Kuder Richardson (KR-21) formula was used to collect data. Analysis of Covariance and Bonferroni test were applied for data analysis. Findings revealed that CM and CML groups scored better in all cognitive domains tested than the CTM group. A statistically significant difference between CM and CML was observed in favor of the CM. Based on the findings, it was concluded that the CM and CML are capable of improving secondary school students’ mastery of the content taught at all levels of cognition. Therefore, learning with CM and CML could be a viable option for teachers for addressing attainment issues in biology. © 2022, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science. All rights reserved.

AB  - Learning physics in any context, including undergraduate research experiences, requires learning its concepts and the relational structure between those new concepts with what students already know. We use concept maps, a knowledge elicitation method, for assessing mentees’ and mentors’ knowledge structures during Research Experience for Undergraduates programs. The study looked at maps from seven mentor-mentee pairs to understand how mentors and mentees use specific knowledge and strategies during the development of their concept maps. A qualitative analysis of the maps showed mentors and mentees differed in their ways of organizing and displaying their knowledge in terms of structure, scale, language, and use of conceptual and procedural knowledge. For instance, mentees used more procedural knowledge. It is perhaps due to their perception of finishing their Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) projects and the fact that they may have only limited and superficial knowledge of specific topics. However, mentors maps were smaller but more significant in using more comprehensive conceptual knowledge and connecting their maps to the broader scientific context. © 2022, American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) education is attracting increasing attention, but how to improve students’ STEM learning achievement is still a big challenge. In the process of learning, students actively set learning goals, organize learning content, set learning standards, and independently adapt learning strategies and monitoring measures in order to achieve their own learning goals and to help them learn STEM knowledge and skills. Concept mapping is considered to be an effective visualized knowledge organizing tool that helps students to manage and organize their knowledge systematically and visually. This study proposes a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning approach. A quasi-experiment was conducted using a concept mapping-based self-regulated learning system in order to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach significantly improved students’ STEM skills, but not their STEM knowledge compared to the conventional self-regulated learning approach. The proposed learning approach helped to improve students’ self-regulation compared to the conventional self-regulation learning approach. In short, the concept mapping-based self-regulation learning approach enhances students’ self-efficacy and self-regulation, which in turn helps students to learn STEM skills effectively. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research was conducted to reconstruct the sustainability-oriented learning stages’ design on fire-retardant bamboo and its effect on self-efficacy and perceptions of prospective chemistry teacher students. This study uses mix method with Exploratory Sequential Design, which is guided by the Model of Educational Reconstruction (MER) with the following stages: (1) content structure analysis, (2) research on students’ pre-conceptions, and (3) learning design development. The instruments used were text analysis sheets, interview guidelines, validation sheets for the design of the learning stages, and questionnaires on student self-efficacy and perceptions. The topic used to develop the learning stages is the concept of ionic liquids as fire-retardant agents. The research data are scientific conceptions related to learning issues and chemical ideas. In addition, students’ pre-conceptions regarding learning topics were obtained, followed by results validating the design of learning stages as well as the ability of students’ perceptions and self-efficacy. The scientist’s conception was analysed using the content qualitative analysis method, resulting in a concept map. The result of students’ pre-conception on fire-retardant bamboo interview showed that the topic was new to the students. The percentage of students’ self-efficacy abilities increased to 88.9%, which is in the excellent category. The students’ perceptual abilities rate increased to 92.8%, which is in the agreed category. Thus, the design of sustainability-oriented learning stages on fire-retardant bamboo can increase the self-efficacy and perceptions of prospective chemistry teacher students. The design of the learning stages can help prospective teacher students integrate chemical concepts with technological engineering in learning. Using sustainable materials in the learning stages can foster sustainability literacy in students and support the creation of sustainability-oriented education in the higher education environment. © Penerbit Universiti Sains Malaysia, 2022.

AB  - Concept maps are graphical tools for organizing and representing knowledge. They are recommended for biology learning to support conceptual thinking. In this study, we compare concept map construction (CM-c, i.e., creating concept maps) and concept map study (CM-s, i.e., observing concept maps). Existing theories and indirect empirical evidence suggest distinct effects of both formats on cognitive, metacognitive and emotional aspects of learning. We developed a CM-c training, a CM-s training, and a brief introduction to concept maps (control training) for junior high school students. We investigated effects on learning performance, concept map quality, cognitive load (cognitive effects), accuracy of self-evaluation (metacognitive effects) and enjoyment (emotional effects) of these trainings in a subsequent learning phase (CM-c learning vs. CM-s learning) in a quasi-experimental two-factorial study with 3 × 2 groups (N = 167), involving the factors training type and learning type. Results reveal that CM-c training increased learning performance and concept map quality. Effects of CM-c training on learning performance transferred onto learning with CM-s. Self-evaluation was slightly more accurate after CM-c training than CM-s training. Students reported moderate, and highly varying enjoyment during CM-c and CM-s learning. The superiority of CM-c over CM-s in learning performance and concept map quality probably lies in its characteristic of being an active learning strategy. We recommend practitioners to favor CM-c training over CM-s training, and foster students’ active engagement and enjoyment. Copyright © 2022 Lenski, Elsner and Großschedl.

AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of ‘clinical credibility’ in nursing science. Methods: This is stage 2 of a registered report. Concept mapping methodology, 1. Preparation, 2. Generation of statements (brainstorming), 3. Structuring of statements (prioritising/clustering), 4. Representation of statements, 5. Interpretation of maps and 6. Utilisation of maps were used. Part 1 of our registered report followed the required items on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. Part 2 was reporting the results of our study adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines. Results: Participants (n = 67) from three stakeholder groups participated in this study. Nursing students (n = 23), nurses and other healthcare professionals (n = 23), and patients (within the last 12 months) (n = 21). Participants (n = 62) generated statements (n = 429) in response to the question: ‘What does clinical credibility mean to you?’. Following statement reduction, participants (n = 61) prioritised and clustered (n = 80) statements. The data were analysed using the concept mapping software, Ariadne. A visual ‘concept map’ was produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by all participants. The final concept map had nine clusters. In order of importance these are as follows: 1. Safe practice, 2. Communication, 3. Patient-centred care, 4. Accountable, 5. Professional practice, 6. Clinical competence, 7. Teaching attributes, 8. Contemporary expert and 9. Leadership. This study was undertaken over an eight-month period. Conclusion: Clinical credibility is not necessarily about contemporary clinical practice. It is a multidimensional construct of which current clinical practice is one element. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - The research presented in this paper tested whether drawing concept maps changes how engineering students construct design problem statements and whether these differences are observable in their brains. The process of identifying and constructing problem statements is a critical step in engineering design. Concept mapping has the potential to expand the problem space that students explore through the attention given to the relationship between concepts. It helps integrate existing knowledge in new ways. Engineering students (n=66) were asked to construct a problem statement to improve mobility on campus. Half of these students were randomly chosen to first receive instructions about how to develop a concept map and were asked to draw a concept map about mobility systems on campus. The semantic similarity of concepts in the students' problem statements, the length of their problem statements, and their neurocognition when developing their statements were measured. The results indicated that students who were asked to first draw concept maps produced a more diverse problem statement with less semantically similar words. The students who first developed concept maps also produce significantly longer problem statements. Concept mapping changed students' neurocognition. The students who used concept mapping elicited less cognitive activation in their left prefrontal cortex (PFC) and more concentrated activation in their right PFC. The right PFC is generally associated with divergent thinking and the left PFC is generally associated with convergent and analytical thinking. These results provide new insight into how educational interventions, like concept mapping, can change students' cognition and neurocognition. Better understanding how concept maps, and other tools, help students approach complex problems and the associated changes that occur in their brain can lay the groundwork for novel advances in engineering education that support new tools and pedagogy development for design. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022

AB  - Our civilization recognizes that errors can be valuable learning opportunities, but for decades, they have widely been avoided or, at best, allowed to occur as serendipitous accidents. The present research tested whether greater learning success could paradoxically be achieved through making errors by intentional design, relative to traditional errorless learning methods. We show that deliberately committing and correcting errors even when one knows the correct answers enhances learning—a counterintuitive phenomenon that we termed the derring effect. Across two experiments (N = 160), learners engaged in open-book study of scientific expository texts and were then tested on their retention and higher-order application of the material to analyze a novel news event. Deliberate error commission and correction during study produced not only better recall performance, but also superior knowledge application compared to two errorless study techniques that are popular among students and educational researchers: copying with underlining, and elaborative studying with concept mapping (Experiment 1). These learning benefits persisted even over generating alternative conceptually correct answers, revealing that the derring effect is not merely attributable to generation or elaboration alone, but is unique to producing incorrect responses (Experiment 2). Yet, learners were largely unaware of these advantages even after experiencing them. Our results suggest that avoiding errors in learning may not always be most optimal. Rather, deliberate erring is a powerful strategy to enhance meaningful learning. We discuss implications for educational practice in redesigning conventional approaches to errors: To err is human; to deliberately err is divine. © 2021 American Psychological Association

AB  - When technological challenges involve complex systems that include interactions with other components or agents, the system can exhibit unexpected and counterintuitive behavior. Systems thinking is useful in such cases but is rarely taught in engineering courses that do not explicitly include 'systems' or 'systems dynamics' in the syllabus. This work-in-progress describes an application of systems thinking concepts in an undergraduate and a graduate course in Agricultural Waste Management at North Carolina State University. Two specific systems thinking tools were introduced to help students appreciate the technical, economic, and social challenges related to implementing new animal manure management technologies in a production environment that already includes an established regulatory framework. The first tool was the concept map. The goal of the project was to explore the complex interactions of various stakeholders and agents of food animal production. Students in the undergraduate class were asked to create a concept map, in the form of a diagram, of the North Carolina swine industry with a focus on manure management and environmental impacts and protections. Each of the six students in the graduate class additionally created their map from the perspective of a different stakeholder group. Students also reviewed and provided feedback on the draft map from a second stakeholder perspective. Each student wrote a description of the system and map from their assigned stakeholder perspective. The second tool was the analysis canvas. The goal of the project was to identify system components that contribute to sustainable swine manure management in North Carolina and the changes in position, rules, regulations, and relationships among those components needed to facilitate sustainability. Two teams were formed in each class. In the graduate class the teams were formed so that all stakeholder perspectives from the first project were represented by students who had taken that perspective either as a primary or secondary role. Each team investigated a novel swine manure management technology that had previously been studied under the Smithfield Agreement yet had not been widely adopted at the time. Using the Product Archaeology Canvas, each team was tasked with describing what changes were needed to facilitate adoption of an advanced manure management system and the expected improvements in sustainability of the North Carolina swine industry. The teams also identified the critical issues for the stakeholders and the important compromises they would be asked to make for the system to work as described. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021

AB  - Mental models are relevant in both managerial decision making and management education. Decision-making studies have demonstrated how managers benefit from more accurate mental models by gaining higher-quality heuristics and better performance. However, management education studies assessing mental models as learning outcomes remain rare. This study aims at understanding how students' mental models change during a business simulation course. We designed a pre- and post-simulation concept map assignment that illustrated students' mental models as number of concepts, connections between concepts, and written explanations. The findings of our study demonstrate that students’ mental models changed through two interconnected processes: addition of new knowledge and change of misconceptions in existing knowledge. Based on these results, we composed a model of conceptual change through business simulation gaming. Our study contributes to the research on learning from business simulations and addresses the recent call for more conceptual change research in social sciences by enhancing the conceptual change discussion in the management education literature. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - This study aims at developing an electronic portfolio-based assessment strategy as valid and reliable assessment for learning on colloidal system material to measure student concept mastery. This study used a Design-Based Research (DBR) with a 4D development model that is carried out until stage 3 (Define, Design, and Development). The participant in this study were 10 students of class XI in one of High Schools in Bandung who were involved in the limited trial phase. The concept mastery ability measured in this study used the Revised Bloom’s Taxonomy framework. However, the researcher only used the cognitive level of applying (C3) and analyzing (C4) based on the analysis of Core Competence and Basic Competence in the syllabus for colloidal system material. The tasks developed in this electronic portfolio assessment consist of three tasks, namely a concept map of the types of colloids; papers on the properties of colloids, the application of the properties of colloids in life, and how to make colloids; and a practical simulation report on the colloidal properties of the Tyndall effect. The results showed that the instrument was valid with a CVR value of 0.6 - 1.0 and reliable with a Cronbach Alpha value of 0.679 - 1.000. Based on the results of a limited trial of the developed electronic portfolio-based assessment strategy, it can measure student concept mastery on colloidal system material. Overall, the average level of student concept mastery is categorized as good. With details in the category of very good (30%), good (50%) and sufficient (20%). © 2022

AB  - In this paper, to handle the problem of the quick evolution of cyber-security attacks, we developed the iMonsters board game and proposed the attack and defense knowledge self-evolving algorithm. Three versions of the iMonsters were launched in 2013, 2017, and 2019, respectively. Accordingly, the cyber-security ontology can be refined by the ontology fusion-or-splitting procedure for the newly collected cyber-security incidents, as well as the roles and rules of the iMonsters can be refined by the gaming portfolio mining procedure for the collected portfolio. Furthermore, we conducted game-based learning (GBL), a quasi-experiment of pre/post-testing, and concept map testing using the iMonsters board game in a children’s summer camp. The experimental results indicate that the students can acquire up-to-date cyber-security knowledge with the iMonsters better than students who learn in a traditional classroom setting, and the students’ satisfaction with acquiring cyber-security knowledge with the instructional design of the iMonsters is better compared with learning in a traditional classroom setting. Satisfaction with the new version has continuously increased. Besides, the results of the in-depth interviews show that the new version was easier to learn. Thus, we may conclude that using the self-evolving iMonsters can improve learning effectiveness and participation in GBL. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The effects of Concept Mapping (CM) and Cooperative Mastery Learning (CML) strategies on students' attitudes towards biology were investigated in this study to instill a positive attitude in students toward biology. The study adopted a quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design with pre-and post-tests. A total of 449 senior secondary students (SS2) from Nyamagabe District, Rwanda was studied. Pre- and post-administration of biology Attitude Questionnaire (BAQ) with the reliability (α= 0.95) was used to obtain data. Mean, standard deviation, analysis of covariance, and Bonferroni test were applied for data analysis. The findings showed that students exposed to the CM and CLM strategies have a significantly higher attitude towards biology than those taught using conventional teaching methods (CTM) (F (2, 445) =26.717, p=.000<.05). There was no significant difference in mean attitude scores between male and female students who were taught biology using CM (F (1,148) =.635, p=.427>0.05) and CML (F (1,141) =. 670, p=.796>0.05). Also, the results showed no significant interaction effect of treatment and gender on the attitude of students towards biology (F (2,442) =.586, p=.557>0.05). The study concluded that the CM and CML are effective teaching strategies in raising students’ attitudes towards biology regardless of gender. It is recommended among other things that biology teachers should adopt the CM and CML strategies during instruction to help students develop a positive attitude toward biology. © 2022 University of Helsinki.

AB  - The general development of knowledge in physics particulary, requires the ability to understand the right and obey the principles. This study purposed to carried out the use of learning models to ensure a quality learning process with the right concepts and avoid misconceptions. The learning model is also adaptive to the 4.0 era demands and the special situation of the pandemic era. The learning model is PIMCA (presentation-idea mapping-conceptualization-assessment formative). The PIMCA learning model is based on the main theories of educational psychology, such as behavioristic, cognitive, constructivist, and humanistic. It was conducted to students in the physics education department at Manado State University, used experimental study in various fields of physics studies such as waves, optics, electricity, and magnetism, it was found that the average achievement of learning progress from the pre-test and post-test was 73.14%. Likewise, in terms of conceptual understanding of physics, namely from idea maps and concept maps, an average increase of up to 84% is obtained. The major findings of this study indicate that the PIMCA learning model can be effectively used as an alternative in learning physics. Study using PIMCA learning models needs to be continued to be applied to the learning of physics in the field of mechanics and modern physics, as well as in the learning of mathematics, science, including biology-chemistry-geology and astronomy, and engineering.  © 2022 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd

AB  - In-company training is facing new challenges in preparing employees for the demands of digitalized and automated manufacturing. New training concepts like microlearning are necessary to support work-process-related learning. To handle the limitations of microlearning, we develop a 360-degree learning system to demonstrate a realistic work environment and overcome the lack of design knowledge supporting the motivation and performance of employees using such systems. Based on a systematic literature review and semistructured interviews, we have developed design requirements for interactive 360-degree learning environments. We used a workshop-based mixed-method approach with interviews, concept maps, and video analysis to evaluate the motivation and performance of precision mechanics within a prototypical work-process-oriented learning environment in an intercompany vocational training center. The results show a positive effect on learning outcomes and motivation. In addition, the ease of use and sense of presence while using the learning environment are rated as high. We contribute to theory by shedding new light on learners' motivation and performance within work-process-oriented interactive 360-degree learning environments. Furthermore, we offer guidelines for developing interactive 360-degree learning environments against the background of the current metaverse discussion.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - This research used Novakian concept mapping and interview techniques to track changes in knowledge and understanding amongst students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards a laboratory science-based PhD. This detailed longitudinal case study analysis measures both cognitive change in the specific subjects that are the topic for research, and the understanding of the process of PhD level research and supervision. The data show the challenges for students and supervisors from different national, ethnic, cultural, and academic backgrounds and traditions with a focus on how this impacts the PhD research process and development. Working cross-culturally, and often in a setting different from either the student or the supervisor’s background and training, can lead to a lack of common language and understanding for the development of a pedagogically oriented supervisory relationship. Documenting change in knowledge and understanding among PhD students and their supervisors is key to surfacing what the joint processes of mutual democratic research and of supervision may entail. This study explores how one of these key processes is a student’s developing sense of belonging (or non-belonging). Specifically, this paper engages the concepts of belonging, and democratic education through mutual learning, to explore the practices of working across national, cultural, ethnic, and diverse academic backgrounds, for both supervisors and students. Doctoral study is understood as a situated context in which belonging also acts as a gateway for who can join the global scientific community. © 2022 by the authors.

AB  - Background: Childhood obesity is a serious issue in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, but there is no known community intervention. The aim of the study was to use a participatory approach to obtain the perspectives of students, school staff and Ministry of Education (MoE) representatives and parents on important and feasible intervention opportunities for school-based obesity prevention for adolescent girls. Method: The study was conducted in two intermediate schools for girls (13–15 years old) in Jeddah that were purposefully identified with the support of the MoE. Group concept mapping, a mixed method approach, was conducted with 19 adults which included staff from the MoE and schools, school canteen suppliers and mothers. Adults generated statements in response to two prompts (P); P1 “The factors influencing adolescent obesity in Saudi are..” and P2 “The content of school-based programmes should focus on..” Photovoice-enhanced concept mapping was used with students (n = 15 students) to capture adolescent perspectives on what influences their dietary and physical activity habits. Students generated statements' using their own photographs. Stakeholders, both adult and students, sorted the statements into themes and rated each statement for relative importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to produce concept maps with the input from students and adults. Result: Adults generated 35 statements in response to P1 and identified five themes that influenced adolescent obesity including “Home Environment,” “Lifestyle,” “School Environment,” “Community,” “Biology.” They generated 42 statements in relation to P2 and identified four themes including “Ministry of Education Support,” “School Environment,” “Public health programmes” and “Wider environmental influences.” Students generated 42 statements from 39 pictures. They identified five themes that influenced their dietary and physical activity habits—“Role of Government,” “School Environment,” “Home Environment,” “Retail Environment” and “Cultural Practices.” Both groups identified several common important and feasible actions with a strong emphasis on improving the school environment, in particular food provision, with MoE support. Exemplar corresponding statements from adults were “Offer healthy foods in the canteen,” “Remove chocolates and sweets” and “Educate children about healthy foods” and from students were “Offer fruit and vegetables in the canteen,” “Remove chocolates from the canteen,” “Healthy meals should not expensive.” Lack of correspondence related to students' emphasis on access to both healthy foods and physical activity in schools and the wider environment (e.g. retail environments), while adults emphasized school-based education and food provision. After further consultations, both stakeholder groups agreed on improving access to healthy foods in the canteen. Conclusions: Students and school and MoE staff jointly agreed that a canteen-based intervention was important and feasible to improve dietary habits and thus help to prevent obesity among adolescent girls. This was the first time a participatory approach was used with students for intervention development in Saudi Arabia. A co-development approach may have value to improve their school food environments. Copyright © 2022 Almughamisi, O'Keeffe and Harding.

AB  - When students in programming courses are taught event-driven programming (EDP) for the first time, they face new terminology and concepts that they should internalize. Moreover, they learn a fully new approach for reasoning about program logic and execution order. However, there is a lack of research in students' understanding of these concepts. In this paper, we describe a study, in which we asked web development students to explain their conception of EDP: what are the main concepts involved and how they interact. Moreover, we asked them to explain the execution of a short piece of JavaScript code that focuses on basic usage of events and event listeners. The answers, which we requested as concept maps and text, were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Our results clearly demonstrate shortcomings in the students' learning and illustrate various misunderstandings that they may have regarding EDP. Based on the findings, we give suggestions for improving the teaching of EDP.  © 2021 ACM.

AB  - Introduction Mechanisms explain how implementation strategies work. Implementation research requires careful operationalisation and empirical study of the causal pathway(s) by which strategies effect change, and factors that may amplify or weaken their effects. Understanding mechanisms is critically important to replicate findings, learn from negative studies or adapt an implementation strategy developed in one setting to another. Without understanding implementation mechanisms, it is difficult to design strategies to produce expected effects across contexts, which may have disproportionate effects on settings in which priority populations receive care. This manuscript outlines the protocol for an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-funded initiative to: (1) establish priorities for an agenda to guide research on implementation mechanisms in health and public health, and (2) disseminate the agenda to research, policy and practice audiences. Methods and analysis A network of scientific experts will convene in 'Deep Dive' meetings across 3 years. A research agenda will be generated through analysis and synthesis of information from six sources: (1) systematic reviews, (2) network members' approaches to studying mechanisms, (3) new proposals presented in implementation proposal feedback sessions, (4) working group sessions conducted in a leading implementation research training institute, (5) breakout sessions at the Society for Implementation Research Collaboration's (SIRC) 2019 conference and (6) SIRC conference abstracts. Two members will extract mechanism-relevant text segments from each data source and a third member will generate statements as an input for concept mapping. Concept mapping will generate unique clusters of challenges, and the network will engage in a nominal group process to identify priorities for the research agenda. Ethics and dissemination This initiative will yield an actionable research agenda to guide research to identify and test mechanisms of change for implementation strategies. The agenda will be disseminated via multiple channels to solicit feedback and promote rigorous research on implementation mechanisms. © 2021 Author(s). Published by BMJ.

AB  - As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience speciﬁcally on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simpliﬁed complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

AB  - Introduction: Concept maps are graphical representations of knowledge that connect concepts, ideas, and relationships. The present study aims at assessing the perception of medical students in utilization of concept maps as a tool to foster their lifelong learning skills in immunology. Methods: The current study was approved by Institutional Ethics and Review Committee. Third-year undergraduate (MD3) medical students of the academic year 2021-22 were sensitized about the concept map study and included after obtaining their informed consent. The students worked in teams to find answers and link the different words or phrases of the concept maps. At the end of the immunology course, students’ perception on concept map-based learning strategy was assessed. A pre-designed, self-administered questionnaire, pre-validated by subject experts for relevance and feasibility, was used for the study. The questionnaire included some quantitative questions assessed by using 3-point Likert Scale and an open-ended question to receive students’ comments on concept map-based learning strategy. The responses were collected and analyzed using SPSS version 22. Descriptive statistics was used for the quantitative variables, tabulated as numbers and percentages while the qualitative data was analyzed by thematic analysis. The quantitative data results were prioritized but supported by students’ comments on open ended question. Results: Out of 133 eligible participants, 109 students who volunteered and completed the study were included. Majority of our participants (>80%) welcomed the concept map-based learning strategy. Almost 4 out of 5 expressed that concept maps are interesting and enjoyable, encourage active participation, peer discussion, and enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills. More than 80% of the students agreed that concept maps promoted deep understanding of the topic and lifelong learning. Nearly 3 out of 4 students suggested including concept maps in many immunology topics in future. Majority of students penned down positive comments indicating concept map tool facilitates metacognitive skills. Conclusion: From the study, it can be concluded that concept maps are effective active learning strategies to improve the metacognitive domain of medical students in immunology course, thus assisting them to become better lifelong learners. © 2022, Shriaz University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Explanation of natural phenomena at one level of biological organisation almost always involves causes that are found at other levels. Although scientists thinking across levels find it easy to explain physiological phenomena, students often perceive this as a challenge. We developed a new graphic organiser called Zoom Map, which is a mode for structuring biological information along the levels of biological organisation and is designed to guide biology students when they need to consider the levels of organisation. The aim of this study is to examine how Zoom Map helps students explain a common phenomenon in plant physiology: leaves that are upright or wilted. Accordingly, we designed a teaching experiment covering 13 students. During the experiments, the students were videotaped. We used qualitative content analysis to examine the explanations. Our findings indicate that Zoom Map improved students’ explanations of the phenomenon across multiple levels of organisation: The students used more levels than before, and they referred to lower levels that were lacking previously. Therefore, it can be concluded that students who use Zoom Map are supported in their ability to explain a biological phenomenon across the levels of biological organisation. © 2022 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - A crucial step in problem solving is the retrieval of already learned schemata from long-term memory, a process which may be facilitated by categorization of the problem. The way knowledge is organized affects its availability, and, at the same time, it constitutes the important difference between experts and novices. The present study employed concept maps in a novel way, as a categorization tool for chemical equilibrium problems. The objective was to determine whether providing specific practice in problem categorization improves student achievement in problem solving and in conceptual understanding. Two groups of eleventh-grade students from two special private seminars in Corfu island, Greece, were used: The treatment group (N = 19) and the control group (N = 21). Results showed that the categorization helped students to improve their achievement, but the improvement was not always statistically significant. Students at lower (Piagetian) developmental level (in our sample, students at the transitional stage) had a larger improvement, which was statistically significant with a high effect size. Finally, Nakhleh's categorization scheme, distinguishing algorithmic versus conceptual subproblems in the solution process, was studied. Dependency of problem solving on an organized knowledge base and the significance of concept mapping on student achievement were the conclusion.  © 2021 Antonios Bakolis et al.

AB  - Science-art residencies can provide opportunities for insightful cross-disciplinary collaborations, science communication, and engagement with the general public. Currently, there are few formal ways for artists and scientists to collaborate in Canada, and even fewer publications on how these experiences can impact learning in informal settings. Art the Science (a Canadian non-profit organization facilitating cross-disciplinary relationships between artists and scientists) piloted a comprehensive multiphase science-art residency program. Phase 1 informed the artist’s work through a full-time experience in a scientific laboratory at an academic institution, Phase 2 showcased the artist’s final artwork, Between the Sand at an off-campus local community event, and Phase 3 published an interactive online version of the work for global exhibition. Residency evaluation in each phase was conducted through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, concept mapping, video diaries, and surveys. The artist, scientist and lab members gained new perspectives and inspiration about their respective fields. The artist was able to incorporate theories and processes from the research group into their artistic practice. On the other hand, the scientist saw renewed enthusiasm and curiosity within their research lab, and the lab members reported new ways of thinking about how to communicate their research. Both exhibitions proved to be engaging informal learning experiences for 66.2% of survey participants, and revealed several major learning themes. Despite promoting both events as artwork exhibitions, 79.2% of survey participants considered Between the Sand as both an artwork and a science communication product suggesting that science-based art may have the potential to communicate science, even when it is not presented as a science communication effort. Public responses revealed that public perception of funding is not skewed to either discipline and instead seems to call upon both science and arts grants to fund such interdisciplinary initiatives. Providing comprehensive artist residencies in science labs may have a valuable impact on everyone involved: the artist, the research group, and the public. Copyright © 2022 Lau, Barriault and Krolik.

AB  - The implementation of systems approaches and systems thinking has been considered as an important parameter for reforming chemistry education and practice. The “Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL)” strategy is a teaching-learning approach which is based on the development and use of cyclic concept mapping procedures, known as systemics, for teaching as well as for students’ assessment, known as SAQs. The SATL strategy focuses on the enhancement of students’ systems thinking skills, which are believed to enhance their understanding of relevant science concepts. The aims of this study were: (a) To investigate the effect of the implementation of the SATL strategy on 11th grade students’ deep understanding of chemistry concepts, and (b) to explore the relationship between students’ understanding in chemistry and the development of basic systems thinking skills. For this purpose, an experimental group, taught by the SATL strategy, was compared with a control group taught by a traditional linear approach, regarding students’ chemistry understanding. For the intervention group, the relationship between students’ understanding and their systems thinking skills was also explored. The results indicated that chemistry understanding of students taught by the SATL strategy was significantly greater compared to that of students taught by a traditional linear approach. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between students’ deep understanding of chemistry concepts and their systems thinking level. This research provides evidence for a possible relationship between chemistry deep understanding and the development of systems thinking skills. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Medical image segmentation plays a vital role in computer-aided diagnosis procedures. Recently, U-Net is widely used in medical image segmentation. Many variants of U-Net have been proposed, which attempt to improve the network performance while keeping the U-shaped structure unchanged. However, this U-shaped structure is not necessarily optimal. In this article, the effects of different parts of the U-Net on the segmentation ability are experimentally analyzed. Then a more efficient architecture, Half-UNet, is proposed. The proposed architecture is essentially an encoder-decoder network based on the U-Net structure, in which both the encoder and decoder are simplified. The re-designed architecture takes advantage of the unification of channel numbers, full-scale feature fusion, and Ghost modules. We compared Half-UNet with U-Net and its variants across multiple medical image segmentation tasks: mammography segmentation, lung nodule segmentation in the CT images, and left ventricular MRI image segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that Half-UNet has similar segmentation accuracy compared U-Net and its variants, while the parameters and floating-point operations are reduced by 98.6 and 81.8%, respectively, compared with U-Net.

AB  - In undergraduate engineering programs, recent emphasis has been placed on a more holistic, interdisciplinary approach to engineering education. Some programs now teach product design within the context of the market, extending the curriculum to topics outside of scientific labs and computational analysis. This study analyzes survey and concept map data collected from 154 students in a third-year engineering design course. The aim is to evaluate the impacts of student backgrounds and experiences on their mental models of product design. Data were gathered from surveys on student backgrounds and experiences, along with concept maps that were generated by the students on the first day of a product design class. The concept maps were analyzed in a quantitative manner for structural and thematic elements. The findings show that several background attributes influence student conceptions of product design. Academic major appeared to have the largest impact on a variety of variables. Additionally, prior work experience, enrollment in a master's program, and the presence of an engineering role model at home all showed significant impacts on design conceptions. By analyzing and understanding unique backgrounds of students, educators can adjust their curricula to more effectively teach design concepts to students of various backgrounds and experiences. © 2022 by ASME.

AB  - The typical introductory physics lecture requires students to consolidate and assimilate a large quantity of complex information that is often novel to them. This can leave students overwhelmed, slow the pace of their learning, and lower their motivation. We find that carefully designed multimedia summaries in the form of one-minute videos and short text summaries can significantly increase students' understanding of the material as well as their ability to organize information into a useful mental framework, as measured by their performances on a concept mapping exercise and a conceptual test of learning. Notably, we show that these improvements can be achieved with negligible increase in overall time students spend on the course material each week. We discuss reasons why these short postlecture summaries helped students learn more, namely, that (i) they likely increased students' ability to chunk and organize information while minimizing the extraneous cognitive load imposed by the materials, and (ii) they likely improved students' ability to consolidate and transfer knowledge through the use of contrasting cases. We provide a set of detailed recommendations that instructors can use to develop effective postlecture multimedia summaries. We suggest that one of the most important and impactful recommendations is incorporating student thinking in the design of these types of summaries informed by the input of qualified former students or teaching assistants with significant experience interacting with students in the course.  © 2022 authors.

AB  - Background: Didactic lectures and exam-oriented learning can lead to students becoming passive learners who rely on rote memory. This learning style negatively impacts their ability to cultivate the core nursing values and critical thinking. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the impact of a concept mapping teaching-learning strategy on undergraduate nursing students' ability to integrate theoretical biosciences knowledge into care practice and on their skills in critical thinking and teamwork. Methods: A qualitative research design was adopted. A course entitled Evaluation and Analysis of Adult Nursing Cases was developed based on a concept mapping strategy involving 24 simulated cases relevant to medical and surgical nursing. The participants were students from the two-year undergraduate nursing programme at a university in Taiwan. Data were collected from September 2020 to February 2021. Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 20 students and from 100 reflective reports on students' learning journeys. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Two major themes were identified: (1) changes in learning style and thinking and (2) rewards from learning. The participants reported that their learning style had changed from reliance on rote learning to image memory, and their thinking process from linear (cause-effect) to multifaceted thinking at different levels. The teaching and learning strategies contributed to feelings of ability advancement and psychological safety, which led to learning achievement and confidence. Conclusion: The use of a concept mapping strategy and simulated cases enhanced students' learning by enabling them to integrate theoretical knowledge and improve their thinking abilities. The teaching and learning strategies helped participants in learning about psychological safety and increased their learning confidence. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Concept maps are graphic learning tools that allow teachers and students to organize, represent knowledge, and visualize the relationships between concepts to promote understanding of physics. This study describes an innovative experience based on the development of concept maps with the aim of analyzing the perception of students in a teacher training program in natural sciences and environmental education at a public university in Colombia. The research subjects were 24 students studying basic physics who used concept maps for learning, and the data were analyzed quantitatively using a non-experimental design. The results show that the trainee teachers learned to elaborate concept maps, valuing very positively their educational applications to improve learning. It is concluded that concept mapping can be used to increase students' understanding and motivation which should help to improve their academic performance. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

AB  - Muslim populations in Western countries are growing, and they face biopsychosocial, spiritual, and economic challenges. Although Islam gives utmost attention to mental health stability, Muslims tend to underutilize mental health services. Mental health professionals, whether they be researchers, practitioners, or trainers working in schools, colleges/universities, mental health agencies, and research institutions, are well positioned to serve Muslims. Mental health professionals can address Muslims’ biopsychosocial and spiritual issues and enhance their quality of life. In the current study, as the authors, we (a) reviewed 300 peer-reviewed manuscripts on Muslim mental health to understand how researchers have used concept maps or theoretical frameworks to design their empirical research, (b) prepared a comprehensive concept map based on the literature review to determine the central concepts affecting Muslims’ approach to the use of mental health services, and (c) proposed a contextual theoretical (conceptual) framework. We titled the framework as Muslims’ approach to use of mental health services based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TPB/TRA) in the context of a Social Ecological Model (SEM). We drew the framework based on TPB/TRA, SEM, and the review of Muslim mental health literature (the concept map). The concept map and the framework provide the most important constructs about challenges Muslim’s face when attempting to utilize mental health services. Future researchers can use the concept map and the framework to conduct theoretically and evidence-based grounded empirical research. We provided implications for researchers, practitioners, educators, and social advocates wishing to contribute to service provision to this population. © 2021, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and report on the impact of an in-school science outreach program on children’s self-reported science knowledge, engagement, and skills through a case study of the Science North in-school outreach program “Mission to Mars.” A logic model method was used to outline the specific inputs, outputs, and measurable outcomes of the program. The program outcomes evaluated in this study were (1) experimentation skills, (2) critical thinking skills, and (3) sense of wonder. Results from pre-post surveys demonstrated that participants had increased program topic knowledge. Students self-reported positive emotions toward science more frequently following exposure to the program. Students’ sense of wonder toward science and toward space also increased post-program. This increase in positive emotion toward science could, in the short-term, increase student motivation toward science, which could lead to lasting interests in science in the long-term. Only a small number of students reported an increase in experimentation and critical thinking skills post-program. These skills take time to develop, and the single short-term program evaluated in this study may not have given students enough exposure to these skills for them to experience and show a noticeable change. The results of this study can provide informal science institutions like science centers with important insights into the potential learning impact of their in-school outreach programs, and can be used to improve current and future programs. Other organizations with in-school science outreach programs can benefit from using the methodology in this study to evaluate their programs, as this research includes a combination of innovative data collection methods such as concept maps to determine what students associate with the word “science,” and the use of an emoji scale to capture student emotions toward science. From a larger perspective, this study evaluating the impacts of in-school science outreach could demonstrate the potential benefits and outcomes of this unique area of informal learning, further solidifying the importance of incorporating these inquiry-based programs into classrooms.

AB  - Past studies have found mixed results of the impact of immersive virtual reality (IVR) environments on students' learning. In this study, we examined the effect of using concept maps, a kind of advance organizer, on students' learning of science via IVR. In this exploratory and immersive learning environment, we also explored the roles played by learners' epistemic curiosity and other affective factors. Seventy-four sixth-grade students participated in this research and were randomly assigned to the advance organizer group (AO; experimental group) and the non-advance organizer group (NAO; control group). Data collection included survey questionnaires and a science test for assessing students' understanding of plants. We examined the structural relationships among students’ curiosity and affective factors (including presence, control and active learning, positive emotional engagement, and negative emotional engagement), and compared the learning outcomes of the experimental and control groups. We used analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) for the data analysis. The results showed that students in the AO group had significantly higher scores for science concepts than those in the NAO group. In both groups, the interest-type curiosity and control and active learning positively predicted emotional engagement. Moreover, in the AO group, positive emotional engagement positively predicted the scientific knowledge of plant concepts. Implications for future research and instructional design are suggested in the study. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Aim: To develop a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science. Background: In both academic and clinical settings, the phrase “clinical credibility” is used when discussing the education of health professionals. No clear definition for the concept is evident in the academic literature. To date, there has not been a study undertaken to develop a working definition of clinical credibility in nursing science. Methods: This protocol is stage 1 of a registered report. We will use concept mapping to compare and organise views of three stakeholder groups: nursing students (n = 20) from years 2 or 3 of a three-year Bachelor of Nursing Programme, nurses and other health professionals (n = 20) still practising within a clinical setting, and people who have recently been inpatients in hospital (n = 20). First, participants will take part in separate stakeholder focus groups to generate statements about “What is clinical credibility?”. Second, the same participants will complete two tasks: (1) rank the importance of each statement (prioritising) and (2) put the statements that appear to go together into groups (clustering). The data will then be analysed using a specialised software program called Ariadne. A visual “concept map” will be produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by the participants. The projected timeline for the study is one year. The paper complies with the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines for study protocols adapted for mixed methods research. Conclusion: The findings of this study will provide a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science. Relevance to clinical practice: The findings can be used to develop a measure of clinical credibility to predict student satisfaction and patient safety outcomes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - Internalizing the process and methods of scientific research is fundamental both for young people who are getting prepared to work as scientific researchers, as well as for those who participate in social discourses on scientific issues as responsible citizens. In addition, many current problems can not only be solved from a specialist perspective; interdisciplinary cooperation plays an important role in research and society. It is therefore important that teachers know teaching concepts that enable students to acquire competencies to be prepared for these challenges in life. To implement this, a new pre-service teacher study curriculum was developed as part of the MINTplus2 (engl. STEMplus2) project at TU Darmstadt, which conveys interdisciplinary teaching approaches, especially about STEM. As a part of this project, we developed a new seminar which focusses especially on didactic concepts like inquiry-based learning in order to prepare pre-service science teachers to convey their students the methodological knowledge of the scientific research process. This paper shows the seminar structure embedded in the whole project and the first evaluation results with n=14 concept maps of seven students that show that there is a measurable increase in knowledge regarding the seminar topic.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: The Data and Connectivity COVID-19 Vaccines Pharmacovigilance (DaC-VaP) UK-wide collaboration was created to monitor vaccine uptake and effectiveness and provide pharmacovigilance using routine clinical and administrative data. To monitor these, pooled analyses may be needed. However, variation in terminologies present a barrier as England uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), while the rest of the United Kingdom uses the Read v2 terminology in primary care. The availability of data sources is not uniform across the United Kingdom. Objective: This study aims to use the concept mappings in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to identify common concepts recorded and to report these in a repeated cross-sectional study. We planned to do this for vaccine coverage and 2 adverse events of interest (AEIs), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and anaphylaxis. We identified concept mappings to SNOMED CT, Read v2, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision (ICD-10) terminology, and the UK Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d). Methods: Exposures and outcomes of interest to DaC-VaP for pharmacovigilance studies were selected. Mappings of these variables to different terminologies used across the United Kingdom's devolved nations' health services were identified from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Automated Terminology Harmonization, Extraction, and Normalization for Analytics (ATHENA) online browser. Lead analysts from each nation then confirmed or added to the mappings identified. These mappings were then used to report AEIs in a common format. We reported rates for windows of 0-2 and 3-28 days postvaccine every 28 days. Results: We listed the mappings between Read v2, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and dm+d. For vaccine exposure, we found clear mapping from OMOP to our clinical terminologies, though dm+d had codes not listed by OMOP at the time of searching. We found a list of CVST and anaphylaxis codes. For CVST, we had to use a broader cerebral venous thrombosis conceptual approach to include Read v2. We identified 56 SNOMED CT codes, of which we selected 47 (84%), and 15 Read v2 codes. For anaphylaxis, our refined search identified 60 SNOMED CT codes and 9 Read v2 codes, of which we selected 10 (17%) and 4 (44%), respectively, to include in our repeated cross-sectional studies. Conclusions: This approach enables the use of mappings to different terminologies within the OMOP CDM without the need to catalogue an entire database. However, Read v2 has less granular concepts than some terminologies, such as SNOMED CT. Additionally, the OMOP CDM cannot compensate for limitations in the clinical coding system. Neither Read v2 nor ICD-10 is sufficiently granular to enable CVST to be specifically flagged. Hence, any pooled analysis will have to be at the less specific level of cerebrovascular venous thrombosis. Overall, the mappings within this CDM are useful, and our method could be used for rapid collaborations where there are only a limited number of concepts to pool. © JMIR Form Res 2022.

AB  - Concept maps are powerful tools used to reveal challenges in students’ learning. However, their use introduces complexities when a large group of students’ conceptualizations need to be examined. In this study, concept maps of 344 general chemistry students were analyzed after grouping them based on achievement in chemistry, math proficiency, and gender. The analysis was also expanded with the consideration of eccentricity values and the extended chemistry triplet. Although some similarities exist between the map of high-achieving students in chemistry and that of high-performing students in the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT), the calculated eccentricity values show interesting variations. On the other hand, the analysis of the map of the low-performing students in MPT and that of low-achieving students in chemistry revealed no clear patterns of symbolic, macroscopic, and submicroscopic terms. Practical suggestions were included to increase the use of representative maps in different assessment and teaching scenarios. © 2022 by the authors; licensee Modestum. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This research is conducted to identify the scientific conceptual cognition of ecosystem and the corresponding alternative conceptions by lower-secondary school students in Taiwan. Concept map-ping, interviewing, and two-tier diagnostic test cannot make explicit reasoning path-ways that students may use. Therefore, its purpose is to develop, validate, and utilize a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument for the ecosystem concept (TDIEC). The instrument can assist teachers in ana-lyzing their students’ reasoning. This does not only distinguish alternative conceptions from lack of knowledge but also deter-mines the percentages of false positives and false negatives. One hundred and six students were tested with this instrument in Taiwan. The data analysis reveals common alternative conceptions shared by students, indicating that 35.59% of the samples had inaccurate conceptualizations of ecosystems. Common alternative conceptions of ecosystems include the following: (i) Only biological components constitute an ecosystem; (ii) The Venus flytrap and pitcher plants are preys; (iii) Competition is synonymous to predation; (iv) Ecological balance refers to the sustainable circulation of energy and matter in the environment; and (v) The simpler the species, the more stable the ecosystem. It concludes with the interpretation of the results, suggestions for the application of the TDIEC, and correct alternative conceptions in Ecology classes. © 2022, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

AB  - Traditionally, tools or scales have been developed through a process involving review of the literature on current instruments, expert consultation, and conversations with target groups. While it is an established approach, it does not include the ideas of the STEM community as a whole who are engaged in improving the STEM pipeline. How does one develop a tool that mirrors the diverse perspectives of stakeholders who are uniquely positioned to influence and support students in STEM? The answer lies with the community-based participatory mixed methods methodology of concept mapping that was developed by William Trochim at Cornell University. Concept mapping methodology innovatively engages the stakeholders through participation from outreach to consultation to collaboration through a shared leadership. This methodology integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches in a multi-step democratic process of community engagement and participation through research. This traditional research paper presents the application of this five-step concept mapping methodology to develop the Attitude and Persistence Towards STEM (APT-STEM) tool. The primary objective of this paper is to present an innovative methodology to develop scales through the participatory framework by involving the voices and unique experiences of a STEM community of stakeholders (e.g., students, parents, teachers, researchers, educators, and professionals) as part of the research process to conceptualize the constructs using both quantitative and qualitative methods. While not the focus of this paper, we will also briefly present the validation of this tool for use with secondary and pre-secondary students and an updated version for first-year engineering students in a calculus-based introductory physics class using item response theory. In addition to the methodological (concept mapping for scale development) and theoretical implications (participatory framework) of this study, its practical implications include examining the efficacy of STEM education programs in cultivating specific attitudes and persistence traits as conceptualized by the STEM community. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021

AB  - Physics for medical students is perceived as a sophisticated subject. The sophistication, however, does not lie in the physics concepts themselves or students’ comprehension of the subject, but it is more often related to the ineffectiveness of techniques applied to teach the subject. This study investigates the effect of the Jigsaw technique, a highly structured form of cooperative learning, on the academic achievement of first-year medical students in learning physics. A quasi-experimental research approach with a pretest-posttest design was employed to conduct the study with a purposive randomly selected sample of fifty students made up of twenty-five students in the control group and twenty-five students in the experimental group. The control group was taught using traditional lectures, while the experimental group was taught using the Jigsaw technique which involved students working actively to map the concepts of nuclear radiation in diagnosis and therapy. A comprehensive statistical analysis, which included a Shapiro’s test, paired sample t-test, independent sample t-test, average gain factor, and size effect calculations, was used to test the research hypotheses. The findings of this study showed that there was a statistically significant difference (P < 0.05) between the post-test scores of students exposed to the Jigsaw cooperative learning technique and those who were not. In addition, it was deduced by the educator (first author) that the students were actively engaged with the topic material, took more responsibility for their performance in the activity, learned how to map the radiation physics concepts, and explored a new learning environment that enabled them to use their higher-order thinking skills to solve medical physics problems. © Authors.

AB  - Background: Despite a high rate of bicycle ownership, the prevalence of cycling to school among children and adolescents in Germany has been constantly low. Cycling to school can contribute to meeting the physical activity recommendations, which the majority of children and adolescents in Germany do not meet. Methods: By using intervention mapping, this study protocol describes the systematic planning process of a school-based intervention in Germany aimed to increase the number of days on which students cycle to school and to increase their physical activity levels. To make sure that the intervention will match the needs of students, we conducted a concept mapping study investigating what students need to cycle to school, as perceived by students, parents, and teachers. The logic model of change was based on an integration of the self–determination theory and the social–ecological model. We structured our intervention as two phases, a preparatory phase with weekly components for and a practical phase with a daily repeated component of the targeted behavior. In the 8-week preparatory phase, teachers, parents, and peers will be involved. The content of the 12-week practical phase will involve peers only and was considered promising based on the findings from a systematic review that we conducted to identify the effective strategies of school-based interventions to promote cycling to school among children and adolescents. Overall, our intervention includes 27 behavior change techniques. A researcher, student assistants, teachers, and other collaborators will implement the intervention; a whole-of-school approach with components performed before, during, and after school was chosen. As a study design, we decided to draft a two-arm three-level cluster randomized controlled trial. Both the effect and process evaluation were prepared. In the first instance, approximately 250 students of 12–15 years of age from grade 7 or 8, who attend a secondary school of intermediate or high educational level located in (sub)urban regions in Southern Germany, will pilot the intervention. Discussion: We expect to provide an effective and sustainable intervention for students, which gives insights into the mechanisms of change concerning the behavior of cycling to school and its influence on physical activity levels. © Copyright © 2021 Schönbach, Chillón, Marques, Peralta and Demetriou.

AB  - This is an exploratory study in an undergraduate EFL business-writing course studying participants' ability to read, comprehend, and represent text visually using concept mapping (CM), summary writing, and social network analysis techniques as complementary strategies. The idea with this experiment was to explore if students are capable of analyzing business and technology information from technical readings in a way to represent it graphically with CMs and social networks. Preliminary data from the case study showed that students were reasonably successful in processing texts on topics related to the Tesla electric car company's business and technology models. Multiple iterations and guided instructions when designing CMs demonstrated the interplay of various actors, processes, interactions, and contexts. Student performance indicated significant expertise with CM design and text summarization but inadequate performance designing social networks, indicating the necessity for more structured instructions and practice. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - This preliminary research aims to design instructional material for high school students. The research method used in this development is ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation). The developed Instructional Material refers to the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards)'s first dimension. Our design and development stage includes five parts, namely designing and building the equipment, applying the equipment to measure some physical quantities, data analysis, the effectiveness of teaching and learning, and developing lesson plan for teaching and learning. The result of the development is a comprehensive Simple Solar Energy STEM project lesson plan. This project could discuss various integrated topics, processes, or phenomena such as fusion process in a star, greenhouse effects, electromagnetic waves, alternative energy, thermal physics, and lenses which can be depicted in a concept map. The core competencies, time allocation, assessment, and concept map are incorporated into the lesson plan as part of the instructional material. The designed STEM heater project has discrepancies of 16% and 6.8% compared to advanced tools. These discrepancies are tolerable for educational purposes. The STEM Project is also applicable in every school as it is simple and the material is easy to find. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - At University of California Davis (UC Davis), Fundamentals of Bioengineering is a required 2nd year Biomedical Engineering course aimed to address fundamental bioengineering concepts through the application of conservation principles to biomedical engineering problems. This course serves as a prerequisite course for the upper-division courses in which subsequent courses rely on students' content knowledge from this course. We are therefore continually improving methods to make content more accessible from a learning perspective and enhance conceptual understanding, and as a result, improve overall student performance in the class. Metacognitive skills can have enormous benefits for students within this course, and help students when pursuing higher levels of education, and perform complex tasks in professional life requiring one to take greater responsibility for one's learning. Unfortunately, these metacognitive skills tend to fall outside the content area of most courses, and consequently, they can be often neglected in instruction. In a large Biomedical Engineering class focused on solving mass and energy transfer problems, promoting metacognitive skills was a challenge that was met with two specific interventions - 1) introduction of exam wrappers and class-wide discussion of relevant study strategies, 2) formulating concept maps and discussing them in groups with peers. This paper shares the mechanisms of execution of both of these strategies along with key insights from their implementation in a large sophomore class on Fundamentals of Bioengineering. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021

AB  - Research into students' conceptions is inherently challenged with appropriately transferring profound research questions into suitable research instruments. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to studies with primary school students. In order to investigate individuals' conceptions, besides linear-linguistic questionnaire procedures, classically guided interviews are used, also triangulated with each other or further sub-instruments (e.g. concept mapping techniques). For this latter purpose, seek-and-find-drawings offer a good opportunity, both paper based and digital. This paper presents research on primary school students' conceptions of computers in everyday objects and illustrates a methodical opportunity regarding the use of seek-and-find-drawings in Computer Science Education research. In the presented study, 60 primary school children were presented with a seek-and-find-drawing depicting several everyday encounter situations with computing systems. According to the results, primary school students understand not only personal computers, smartphones, tablets, video gaming consoles and (video) cameras, but in few cases also refrigerators, air conditioners and cars as systems containing (embedded) computers. The experience from the presented paper based hidden objects study can be used especially for future research projects. © 2022 IEEE.

AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a powerful learning tool because of the feedback provider’s active cognitive involvement with the products to be reviewed. The quality of peers’ products is naturally an important factor that might influence not only the quality of the feedback that is given, but also the learning arising from this process. This experimental study investigated the effect of the level of quality of the reviewed product on the knowledge acquisition of feedback providers, as well as the role of prior knowledge in this. Dutch secondary-school students (n = 77) were assigned to one of three conditions, which varied in the quality of the learning products (concept maps) on which students had to give feedback while working in an online physics inquiry learning environment. Post-test knowledge scores, the quality of students’ own concept maps and the quality of the feedback given were analyzed to determine any effect of condition on the learning of feedback providers. Students providing feedback on the lower-quality concept maps gave better feedback and had higher post-test scores. There was no interaction with level of prior knowledge. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Large single-cell atlases are now routinely generated to serve as references for analysis of smaller-scale studies. Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases. © 2021, The Author(s).

AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry-based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi-experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game-based inquiry-based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem-solving performances. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Alternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children’s learning motivation and engagement of game-based inquiry learning activities. Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real-world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles. Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming. What this paper adds An ARG with a mobile concept mapping-based questioning approach (ARG-CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry-based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums). Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs. ARG-CMQ improved children’s learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs. ARG-CMQ might limit children’s divergent thinking and influences their creative problem-solving performance. Implications for practice and/or policy ARG-CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry-based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher-order cognitive abilities. ARG-CMQ can be used to support competency-based education. © 2021 British Educational Research Association

AB  - A concept map is a powerful method that promotes meaningful learning and is highly recommended for use in biology classes. According to multimedia research, the effectiveness of concept maps could be improved by incorporating pictorial elements. Apart from using realistic images, a new field of research claims that specific design manipulations, including human-like features with appealing colors (emotional design), influence learners’ affective state and improve learning. A positive affective state is assumed to evoke emotions and provoke deeper cognitive processing, which increases the cognitive resources available for a task. We conducted two experiments with a total of N = 249 junior high school students, comparing the effect of concept maps with emotional design illustrations (emotional design), with non-emotional design illustrations (neutral design), and without illustrations (control design). Experiment 1 examined the influence of these designs on students’ perceived affective state, perceived cognitive load (extraneous, intrinsic, and germane load), perceived task difficulty, and learning performance (n = 202), experiment 2 focused on the perceived affective state of the students (n = 47). We found that emotional design led to a significant decrease in perceived task difficulty, but we neither found an effect on learning performance nor the positive affective state. Learning with pictorial concept maps (in emotional or neutral design) reduced the negative affect compared to learning with control concept maps. Other than expected, the neutral design led to reduced perceived extraneous and intrinsic cognitive load. Consequently, in terms of learning, emotional design in concept maps did not hamper learning but did not foster it either. Copyright © 2022 Lenski and Großschedl.

AB  - Concept Mapping (CM) is a learning strategy to organize and understand complex rela-tionships, which are particularly characteristic of the natural science subjects. Previous research has already shown that constructing concept maps can promote students’ meaningful learning in terms of deeper knowledge and its more flexible use. While researchers generally agree that students need to practice using CM successfully for learning, key parameters of effective CM training (e.g., content, structure, and duration) remain controversial. This desideratum is taken up by our study, in which three different training approaches were evaluated: a CM training with scaffolding and feedback vs. a CM training without additional elements vs. a non-CM control training. In a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learning outcome of N = 73 university students who each had participated in one of the trainings before. Our results suggest that an extensive CM training with scaffolding and feedback is most appropriate to promote both CM competence and acquisition of knowledge. From an educational perspective, it would therefore be advisable to accept the time-consuming process of intensive practice of CM in order to enable students to adequately use of the strategy and thus facilitate meaningful learning in terms of achieving sustained learning success. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Though concept maps and graphic organisers are useful tools for bilinguals to organise the information being managed and learned, its systematic use is not widened and decisive in CLIL domains. Apart from helping students to acquire meaningful learning, concept mapping might promote in them word-recognition skills for the identification and management of relevant information within foreign language (L2) texts. Hence, this article inquires into the influence of concept maps and graphic organisers as tools for noun category identification from L2 texts. Research sample comprises sixty Spanish primary education students from a bilingual school. Design is quasi-experimental, and the training programme lasted three weeks. Materials used during the training period are not exceptional, but the ordinarily found in regular classrooms. Data gathering procedure consists of the identification and circling of nouns by sample participants. As a starting point, secondary data as the intelligent quotient, learning style, and English level is collected via standardised tests. The analysis of the variance showed a highly significant interaction between the groups and the implemented texts both for noun identification (F 3.171= 12.124, p < 0.000, η 2= 0.175), and the grammatical categories mistakenly identified as nouns (F 3.171= 3.840, p < 0.016, η 2= 0.063). © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Concept maps have emerged as an essential tool for illustrating the mutual relationships between knowledge in the domain. It provides guidance and suggestions in many educational applications such as optimal study order generating, curriculum design and course evaluation. However, there are no consistent datasets for concept map research. In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive dataset for learning concept maps. Specifically, we collect 1292 undergraduate courses in Information Technology (IT) and Computer Science (CS) from 14 Australian universities including course ID, category and prerequisite requirements. Besides, we analyze the semantic properties based on the concepts retrieved from the course description and visualize them to illustrate how our dataset could be used. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset containing course information from Australian universities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Environmental sustainability is important to public health and of particular significance considering the rapidly growing ageing population. While advancement in chemical science has contributed to enhanced quality of life, increasing levels of chemical pollutions and the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment have led to serious concern. The deterioration of environmental quality has been largely due to chemical pollution and the elderly group in the population are more susceptible to the hazardous effects of industrial chemicals and airborne pollutants. This situation also presents uphill challenges to the promotion of healthy ageing which requires a sustainable clean environment, contributed through the advancement of sustainable and green chemistry. However, innovations in gree n chemistry require a systems thinking mindset which is also important in realizing the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment. The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations has called for immediate actions in adopting the SDGs as a central concern in the reform of different domains for the invention of a sustainable future. The practice of chemistry has various impacts on many interconnected systems, re-orientation of chemistry education has been proposed with the implementation of inter-disciplinary approaches as informed by systems thinking, with a growing number of reports suggesting its potentials and applications in chemical education. Despite the vast opinions suggesting the promising prospects of appl ying systems thinking in education, reports on the development of relevant tools and educational resources are only of a limited amount, with recent perspectives identifying the design of educational tools and resources as one of the priority areas. In thi s study, we report the collaborative work across the disciplines of health and chemical sciences in the pedagogic design of incorporating systems thinking in chemistry education adopting the theoretical framework. The design of a system-oriented concept map extension (SOCME) diagram is described, with reference to a case study of chemicals released from the degradation of plastics. The work presented illustrates the potential of systems thinking in sustainable education and adds to the collections of educat ional resources for incorporation of systems thinking in teaching and learning. © 2022 Australasian College of Health Service Management.

AB  - Technology is rapidly changing the world around us and thus, there is a need to adjust education by teaching children skills that are required in the fast-paced digital life. One problem-solving skillset, which has gained considerable attention in the last couple of years, is computational thinking (CT). Up to now, many countries have already implemented CT as an integral part of their education curricula, however, there is still often the misconception that teaching CT requires high technical effort and profound knowledge of computer science. Whereas CT is useful in any subject, it is not necessarily linked to technology and helps children to tackle problems by applying skills that are used in computer science. One effective hands-on approach to foster CT in every subject is modeling. A model is a simplified and reduced version of the real world and modeling is the process of creating it. In this paper, the authors focus on fostering CT skills with models from the field of computer science (CS) in foreign language teaching. The authors present several CS models, that have proven to be useful in language teaching, demonstrate how this approach can foster CT skills and give an insight into their research.  © 2021 Marina Rottenhofer et al., published by De Gruyter 2021.

AB  - Concept maps were created as one of six measures to identify exceptionally talented students during the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM (CDTIS) project, with the goal of identifying and nurturing talents in students from groups traditionally underrepresented in special programs. New methods were compared with conventional methods to select students for an internship in the laboratories of scientists. In this article, we describe development, field testing, and implementation of the concept map assessments in life and physical science. Assessments were field tested in partner schools with high percentages of American Indian (97% to 100%) and Hispanic (83%) low-income students. Students were selected by considering their performance on all six assessments and were placed in internships along with students selected using conventional methods. Concept maps were successful: (a) students from partner schools demonstrated high levels of domain-relevant skills; (b) scores approximated a normal distribution; (c) scores of students from culturally diverse, low-income groups were very similar to the scores of students selected using conventional methods even though many of conventionally identified students had high grade point averages and came from schools in high-income areas with many educational opportunities. Students completed original research and presented posters to the university community and their local communities. Concept maps can be used alone or in combination with other assessments; their use needs to be studied with larger groups of students and in other contexts. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Objective: Team based learning (TBL) is shown to have a positive impact on learning abilities. In this study, we compared the individual and group readiness assurance grades of dental students toward a modified TBL protocol for an orthodontic topic. Methods: All of the dentistry students in 2 different annual intakes from Shiraz University of Medical Sciences took part in the study. The references and methods for holding the class was presented to the vice dean of educational affairs and to the students. At the beginning of the session, individual readiness assurance test (iRAT) was held. Then, the students were asked to arrange in 15-member groups for a modified TBL exercise. Each group took part in the team readiness assessment test (tRAT) and draw concept maps of 5 major topics. Then, they presented their team work, discussed them, and concluded. At the end of the session, the students reported their attitude on the pre-constructed assay form. The data were analyzed with SPSS software 17, using paired T test and Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: We observed statistically significant improvement in the tRAT score compared with iRAT in the male and female participants (P-value <0.001). More than 60% of the participants felt that TBL enhanced the overall satisfaction and pleasure from participation in class. Conclusions: Based on our study, team work depicted significant improvement in the students' scores of an orthodontic topic. According to students, satisfaction with TBL was favorable and improved with additional experience. © 2020 American Dental Education Association

AB  - This study aims to determine pre-service teachers’ conceptual understanding of black-body radiation. Designed as a qualitative study, it employed a case study design, which is one of the descriptive research methods. The study group consists of 18 pre-service physics teachers enrolled as seniors. An opinion form and a concept map were used as data collection tools. In other words, results were intended to be comparatively examined by using two different qualitative data collection methods. Pre-service teachers’ answers were analysed with the help of answer sculptures. At the end of the study, it was determined that while pre-service teachers generally have the correct conceptual structure, they still have some specific gaps in knowledge. It was seen that pre-service teachers have problems with understanding, especially the Wien law and electromagnetic radiation taking place in black-body radiation © 2021.

AB  - Analytical quality assurance, especially testing, is an integral part of software-intensive system development. With the increased usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of such systems, this becomes more difficult as well-understood software testing approaches cannot be applied directly to the AI-enabled parts of the system. The required adaptation of classical testing approaches and the development of new concepts for AI would benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software engineering experts. We see the different terminologies used in the two communities as a major obstacle on this way. As we consider a mutual understanding of the testing terminology a key, this paper contributes a mapping between the most important concepts from classical software testing and AI testing. In the mapping, we highlight differences in the relevance and naming of the mapped concepts. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In 2020, due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the education system passed a fundamental change. Both students and teachers had to acquire new skills in a world with access to a multitude of written or audio-visual information. The role of the teacher in the education process has changed. As his central role diminished, the teacher assumed the position of mentor. This position is reflected in the integration in lessons of modern learning methods that teach the student to use the information he can find from the comfort of his home. The paper presents the neuron, as a cell of the nervous system, an interdisciplinary subject, through interactive concept maps. The conceptual map is realized on two levels, on the first level being presented the nervous system, and on the second level the physical quantities characteristic of the nerve cell membrane and the calculation of their values. The electrostatics and electrokinetics of the nerve cell membrane and its equivalent wiring diagram are presented. By using interactive concept maps, the teacher can present the essential concepts punctually, being necessary to understand them in order to solve new situations in disciplines related to physics. The presentation in Microsoft Office Power Point 365, introduced in the concept map, contains a 3D model of the neuron from its own library of 3D models and has hyperlinks to a video from an online source and to the educational site Mozaweb with interactive 3D content adapted to home learning through maths and information technology. © 2021, National Defence University - Carol I Printing House.

AB  - The current article addressed middle school (13–15 years old) students’ science-related career awareness (SCA) and aimed to determine the effects of a longitudinal intervention, which focused on integrating career education into science teaching, using a pre-and post-test design. During the intervention, five teaching/learning modules (TLMs) were implemented in science lessons that enabled students to experience being (1) an electrical engineer, (2) a food technologist, (3) a forensic scientist or a civil engineer, (4) a team member of oil catastrophe simulation clean-up team, and (5) a customs’ officer. Concept mapping was used to determine the changes in students’ SCA. The suitability of this technique was validated through semi-structured focus group interviews. It was found that concept mapping enabled detection of progression in the intervention students’ SCA among both boys and girls. The interviews provided valuable input on how students interpreted science-related occupations and relevant competences, when constructing their concept maps. An implication from this study was that SCA supportive teaching and learning modules or other similar teaching methods needed to be an inherent part of science teaching to support students making well informed decisions, either towards or away from science-related careers. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - In this study, it is aimed to investigate the effect of prediction-observation-explanation (POE) technique on students' academic achievement and concept learning on seventh grade mass and weight. The research is based on a pretest-posttest simple experimental design model with quantitative background. The sample of the study consists of 19, 7th grade students attending a secondary school in Çorum province. As data collection tool, achievement test consisting of open-ended questions, concept map test and semi-structured interview form were used. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, difference analysis and content analysis. Wilcoxon signed rank test from nonparametric tests was used to compare the achievement of students before and after the application. Interviews with students were conducted through content analysis. As a result of the study, it was determined that POE technique significantly increased the academic achievement of students in terms of mass and weight and was effective in eliminating misconceptions of students and changing their images positively. As a result of the study, various suggestions were made such as conducting similar studies with larger samples and applying different techniques on the same subject. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Past exploration missions have revealed that the lunar topography is eroded through mass wasting processes such as rockfalls and other types of landslides, similar to Earth. We have analyzed an archive of more than 2 million high-resolution images using an AI and big data-driven approach and created the first global map of 136.610 lunar rockfall events. Using this map, we show that mass wasting is primarily driven by impacts and impact-induced fracture networks. We further identify a large number of currently unknown rockfall clusters, potentially revealing regions of recent seismic activity. Our observations show that the oldest, pre-Nectarian topography still hosts rockfalls, indicating that its erosion has been active throughout the late Copernican age and likely continues today. Our findings have important implications for the estimation of the Moon’s erosional state and other airless bodies as well as for the understanding of the topographic evolution of planetary surfaces in general. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Science educators have developed a variety of assessment techniques to help students connect their scientific knowledge and bridge conceptual gaps. In chemistry, concept maps and creative exercises are the two notable assessments that have been implemented into multiple chemistry courses and indicated promising effects on students' conceptual learning and connection-making between chemistry concepts. These two assessment techniques were usually implemented individually in research studies. Herein, we employed a quasi-experimental, mixed-methods approach to explore whether combining concept maps and creative exercises would reveal any synergistic effects for student learning of chemical equilibrium and acid-base chemistry in a college general chemistry course. In this study, student perceptions of the use of the two assessments were examined by open-ended surveys. Interestingly, students perceived creative exercises as an assessment technique while concept maps were viewed as a learning tool for studying or reviewing exams. Additionally, Students believed that concept maps assisted them in answering creative exercises, but not vice versa. The four study groups (control group, concept maps only, creative exercises only, and both concept maps and creative exercises) were compared through concept inventory pre and post-test questions. The results of an ANCOVA indicated that participation in the experimental groups did not significantly impact conceptual learning gains, as measured by the concept inventory post-test scores. However, focus group interviews indicated students from the experimental group that used both concept maps and creative exercises were able to provide more sophisticated scientific explanations for conceptual questions related to the topics of chemical equilibrium and acid-base chemistry. Implications of these research results, best practices for implementation of the two assessments, and future research are discussed. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: Most existing conceptual models of residential environments and housing programs were developed over a decade ago or lack comprehensiveness. The attributes to be used to describe housing programs with adequate specification remain unclear including the attributes that mediate service user outcomes. In this study, group concept mapping was used to develop a conceptual model of housing and community-based residential settings for adults with severe mental illness based on stakeholder perceptions and values. Methods: Participants were selected through purposive sampling and included service users, family members, staff working in residential facilities, mental health workers and managers. Participants (n=221) generated 1,382 statements describing attributes of housing and community-based residential settings for adults with severe mental illness (99% saturation). Thematic content analysis was conducted to analyze the statements and create a list of 140 selected statements. Participants then rated (n=416) and sorted into categories (n=73) the selected statements. Descriptive statistics were computed for each statement relative importance. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis were used to produce the conceptual model (maps). Stakeholders (n=12) were also involved in the interpretation of the maps. Results: The findings show overall concordance between stakeholders in relation to statements perceived importance (rating) and the statements inter-relationships (sorting). The stress value of 0.23 indicates that the two-dimensional solution of the multidimensional scaling analysis fits the data set (goodness of fit). The final conceptualization includes 12 clusters: (1) A balanced and healthy housing system; (2) Quality and management practices (facility/local level); (3) Physical external environment; (4) Services tailored to needs and preferences; (5) Services and interventions provided (linkage); (6) Equality, policies and availability of activities; (7) Organizational structure and staff qualities; (8) Services and interventions (learning skills); (9) Services and interventions (daily living support); (10) Personal space and right to privacy; (11) Physical interior environment; (12) Respect, functioning and atmosphere. Conclusion: The results illustrate the multifaceted and multilevel nature of community-based residential settings through a visual representation. They articulate a number of attributes, clusters and dimensions that could be included in a common conceptual model of community-based residential settings and housing for adults with severe mental illness. © Copyright © 2020 Felx, Kane, Corbière and Lesage.

AB  - As medical schools have changed their curricula to address foundational and clinical sciences in a more integrated fashion, teaching methods such as concept mapping have been incorporated in small group learning settings. Methods that can assess students’ ability to apply such integrated knowledge are not as developed, however. The purpose of this project was to assess the validity of scores on a focused version of concept maps called mechanistic case diagrams (MCDs), which are hypothesized to enhance existing tools for assessing integrated knowledge that supports clinical reasoning. The data were from the medical school graduating class of 2018 (N = 136 students). In 2014–2015 we implemented a total of 16 case diagrams in case analysis groups within the Mechanisms of Health and Disease (MOHD) strand of the pre-clinical curriculum. These cases were based on topics being taught during the lectures and small group sessions for MOHD. We created an overall score across all 16 cases for each student. We then correlated these scores with performance in the preclinical curriculum [as assessed by overall performance in MOHD integrated foundational basic science courses and overall performance in the Clinical and Professional Skills (CAPS) courses], and standardized licensing exam scores [United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)] Step 1 (following core clerkships) and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (at the beginning of the fourth year of medical school). MCD scores correlated with students’ overall basic science scores (r =.46, p =.0002) and their overall performance in Clinical and Professional Skills courses (r =.49, p <.0001). In addition, they correlated significantly with standardized exam measures, including USMLE Step 1 (r =.33, p ≤.0001), and USMLE Step 2 CK (r =.39, p <.0001). These results provide preliminary validity evidence that MCDs may be useful in identifying students who have difficulty in integrating foundational and clinical sciences. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - This Research Full Paper presents the results of a Delphi study. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a term used to describe highly integrated and mutually dependent systems made up of a complex network of hundreds of thousands of interconnected control systems. These systems usually incorporate different mass production and distribution elements to accomplish an industrial purpose. These highly integrated and mutually dependent systems have been deployed to manage, monitor, and control industrial infrastructure to provide essential services, such as electricity, energy, chemical, food and beverage, water, gas, oil, and traffic control systems. As these internet-connected systems and technologies continue to grow globally, the risks and threats of ICS cyberattacks' are rapidly increasing. If left susceptible to cyberattacks, any significant stoppage or interruption can cause real-world damages, considerable loss, and undesirable events. ICS security, the process of keeping these systems secure, is becoming a challenging priority for industrial organizations. A recent study conducted by the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) showed that across eight countries of I.T. decisionmakers, 82 % of employers reported a cybersecurity skills shortage, and 71 % believe this talent gap poses direct and observable harm to their organization. A report by (ISC)2 found that there is a vast ICS cybersecurity workforce gap, and the cybersecurity workforce needs to grow 89% to meet industry needs in the United States and 145% to close the skills gap worldwide. The major factor driving the market is the increasing number of complex cyber-attacks on ICS systems, requiring a high demand for trained and skilled professionals in the ICS cybersecurity field. In 2016, a CSIS survey of IT employers found that only 23 % believed education curriculums were fully training students to join the cybersecurity industry. Likewise, in 2018, ISACA found that 61 % of institutes believe that fewer than half of those filling cybersecurity positions were qualified for the job. The current education curriculum lacks essential cybersecurity programs and degrees. It does not provide a strong foundation for building the role-specific knowledge necessary to meet the needs of the cybersecurity workforce. This deficiency needs to be urgently addressed through the creation of multiple, flexible programs in industrial control systems security. One of the first steps in this development is to identify the most critical knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to become proficient in ICS security. This paper reports on a Delphi study designed to identify these foundational concepts and create a concept map based on the findings. This study used the Delphi method to develop the concept map. A selection of 25 experts in ICS security from academia, industry, and government were contacted and asked to outline a list of core knowledge areas. The researchers developed a summary of the experts' opinions. Two more rounds of input and feedback were solicited from the panel of experts. This paper describes the process and the resulting concept map describing the landscape of ICS cybersecurity.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Concept-maps are widely used to assess students' conceptual understanding in different subject areas. Conventionally, it is mostly built maps which are assessed. In this study, we explore if “concept-mapping” could be used as a case for constructive alignment of both the process and the outcome of learning. Specifically, we have studied how a simple measure of looking at the order in which concept map elements-concepts (cards, C), links (arrows, A), and linking phrases (phrases, P)- are placed on the working space reveals information about the quality of the final generated map. We report findings from analysis of the concept-mapping process in two separate groups of university students (N = 38 (18 + 20)) who were asked, individually, to build concept maps related to two separate concepts in biology and chemistry respectively. We found that, across both groups, students consistently followed the same order of element placement that they began with and found significant differences in the quality of eventual maps resulting from students' map building strategies. Our results suggest that the quality of students' concept maps depends considerably on the strategy used to build it, and point to the supplementary role that the physical working space of the concept-mapping exercise offers to students' own working memory as a possible explanation for these quality differences. © 2020 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB  - Creative thinking skills are one of the skills needed in the 21st century. This study aimed to investigate the Reading-Concept Mapping-Student Team Achievement Division (Remap-STAD) in promoting students' creative thinking skills. This quasi-experiment employed a non-equivalent pretest-posttest control group design. The study participants consisted of 102 eleventh grade students from the Natural Science Program of SMAN 4 Malang Indonesia. The experimental, positive control, and negative control groups were selected based on the homogeneity and normality tests results. The instrument used to measure the participants' creative thinking skills was essay tests. The results of the tests were analyzed using a one-way ANCOVA analysis. This study's findings showed that Remap STAD had the potential to promote students' creative thinking skills. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study with the intention of answering the question: can an intentionally structured online environment stimulate and enhance the processes of mutual interaction and hybridization between digital artefacts and analogic artefacts (books) so as to encourage the development of significant learning in students? This research, carried out in the academic year 2018/2019, involved 183 Italian students enrolled on the bachelor's degree in Primary Education Sciences at the University of Salerno attending the course “School experimentation and educational planning”. The data were collected by working out and using an information retrieval questionnaire and four different tests. The virtual interaction space was e-LENA, the Learning Management System of the RIMEDI@ research lab. The experimental results highlight how this methodology, called DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) by the authors, has had effects in terms of reducing study time and improving learning outcomes. The online learning environment stimulated to study in greater detail with a book, with the learner being able to restructure and systematize his own knowledge. The DMRA valorises the active role of the learner during his process of knowledge construction and may have significant implications for educators who would like to use innovative and effective online learning environments to enhance student learning. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The aim of the present research was to explore the use of concept maps as an assessment tool. The research question posed was: can concept maps be used to quantitatively assess the learning of a physics topic in an engineering course? This paper describes a new approach to quantifying concept maps. The research was preceded by a pilot project that allowed the necessary processes for the proper conduct of the research to be developed. The sample comprised 47 first-year engineering students who were asked to construct a concept map about the content of electrostatic interactions. The concept maps the students prepared were valued quantitatively and qualitatively by an expert instructor. To validate the approach, an analysis of the relationship between the scores given in the three evaluation forms was made. A comparative statistical analysis of the multiple-choice examination data with the quantitative and the qualitative evaluations of the concept maps found not only that there were no significant differences between them in either case, but also that they were moderately, but significantly, correlated. These results suggest that we are on the right track to obtain an effective and easy-to-use tool to evaluate the students’ learning results based on the quantitative assessment of the conceptual maps elaborated by them. Moreover, the analysis of the concept maps in the pilot stage allowed the difficulties that the students had during their learning to be detected, which led to the sequencing of the content of the electrostatic interactions topic being changed. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - The literature study about the structure concept map (CM) of students in the respiratory system aims to find its relationship with scientific reasoning skills. The assessment is carried out by examining the CM structure of literature caused by scientific reasoning skills obtained from the learning process of evidence, events, rejection to be an assumption that allows for further research. The relationship between CM structure and components of reasoning skills is part of the assessment so research requires an instrument of measurement of scientific reasoning skills which is the basis for further research. The assessment showed that the structure of CM is more influenced by students' understanding and knowledge of the concept. The study of the structure of the CM chain derives more from the concept of similarity in meaning, meaning, and level derived from the process of justification and rejection. The spoke structure is dominated more by justification and evidence obtained during the learning process. The net structure is the most complex because in it there is justification, proof, and rejection. The method used is the study of various literature from 2000 to 2020 with limited reasoning skills, structure, and concept map keywords. Literature is analyzed by connecting the CM structure caused by scientific reasoning skills obtained from the learning process of evidence, events, rejection into an assumption that allows for further research. Based on the analysis results of CM structure studies and scientific reasoning skill instruments used to measure reasoning skills are CM structures, the relationship of CM structures with claims, evidence, and evidence. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - Employing scientific reasoning when giving biological explanations comes easily to the experienced scientist. However, students often encounter difficulty when they attempt to explain biological phenomena. One significant obstacle appears to be the failure or inability to bear in mind the levels of organization. To address this issue, learning strategies, such as the yo-yo learning and teaching strategy, recommend moving across the levels of organization and making those levels explicit in the explanation. To support yo-yo learning, we developed a new graphic organizer, the zoom map. The zoom map combines the levels of organization with concept maps. It is specifically tailored to guide students in biology on ways to distinguish, interrelate and reflect the levels of organization. In this paper, we introduce the zoom map as a tool for instruction and diagnosis. We also provide evidence from teaching experiments that demonstrate how the zoom map benefited learning. © 2021, Association of College and Univesity Biology Educators. All rights reserved.

AB  - Over 40 years of research, concept maps have shown that they are beneficial for learning. However, much of this research has been conducted in laboratory settings. Although there are a few studies conducted in the classroom, there is little understanding of the instructional efficacy of using different types of concept maps. In a between-subjects design, the present study investigates the effects of learning chemistry in a large undergraduate classroom with three concept mapping activities: static, fill-in-concepts, and fill-in-labels. Students reviewed a static map or completed a fill-in-the-blank concept map. Results show that students studying static concept maps outperformed those who engaged with the fill-in-the-blank concept maps. Further, prior knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of learning performance. Additional findings show that the accuracy of completing partial concept maps mediates the influence of concept map format on learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in-class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step-by-step hints when conducting problem-posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping-based problem-posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem-posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy-five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map-guided problem-posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP-FL), students in Group B used the problem-posing strategy-based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP-FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop chemistry learning activities using three levels of chemical representations for enhancing upper secondary students' organic chemistry concepts. The three levels of chemical representations are an important framework in chemistry education. Many students held misconceptions in organic chemistry because of students' incapability to connect among the three levels of chemical representations. Development chemistry learning activities using three levels of chemical representations started by analyzing the applications of such a framework in organic chemistry lessons. The teaching strategy would follow the Life-Observation-Notation or LON approach. Chemistry learning activities were developed and received a quality examination by three experts who have experience in teaching chemistry to assess the content validity that arranged the chemistry learning activities according to the content. There are many teaching strategies used in these learning activities, such as concept map, demonstration, analogy, and hands on activities were developed. The learning activities provide abilities to relating the phenomena at a macroscopic level to a microscopic and symbolic level. The learning activities are expected to develop students' understanding of chemical phenomena and organic chemistry concepts.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Physics learning is expected to provide students with the provision to grow and improve critical thinking skills. Learning that is suitable for improving critical thinking is an active learning strategy that is integrated with e-learning. The results of previous studies indicate that college students' critical thinking skills are in low category. This study aims to analyze the improvement of students' critical thinking skills through active learning strategies. The active learning strategies used are Reading guides, Concept Mapping Strategy, and Information Search Strategy. The design of this study used posttest only control group design. Students' critical thinking skills are measured using 6 essays and through student worksheets. The results showed that critical thinking skills of experiment group were higher than control group. © 2021 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: A clinical swallow examination (CSE) provides integral information that informs the diagnostic decision-making process within dysphagia management. However, multiple studies have highlighted a high degree of reported variability within the CSE process. It has been hypothesized that such variability may be the result of the clinical reasoning process rather than poor practices. Aims: To elucidate the nature of expert, speech–language therapists’ (SLTs) clinical reasoning during an initial bedside assessment of patients referred for suspected dysphagia in the acute care environment. Methods & Procedures: An exploratory ‘observation of practice’ qualitative methodology was used to achieve the aim. Four expert SLTs, from two clinical services, completed CSEs with 10 new referrals for suspected dysphagia. All assessments were video-recorded, and within 30 min of completing the CSE, a video-stimulated ‘think aloud’ semi-structured interview was conducted in which the SLT was prompted to articulate their clinical reasoning at each stage of the CSE. Three types of concept maps were generated based on this video and interview content: a descriptive concept map, a reasoning map and a hypothesis map. Patterns that consistently characterized the assessment process were identified, including the overall structure; types of reasoning (inductive versus deductive), facts (i.e., clinical information) drawn upon; and outcomes of the process (diagnosis and recommendations). Interview content was examined to identify types of expert reasoning strategies using during the CSE. Outcomes & Results: SLTs’ approach to clinical assessment followed a consistent structure, with data gathered pre-bedside, during the patient interview and direct assessment before a management recommendation was made. Within this structure, SLTs engaged in an iterative approach with inductive hypothesis-generating and deductive hypothesis-testing, with each decision-making pathway individually tailored and informed by patient-specific facts collected during the assessment. Clinical assessment was primarily geared towards management of an initial acute presentation with less focus on formulating a diagnostic statement. Conclusions & Implications: Variability in reported dysphagia practice is likely the result of a patient-centred assessment process characterized by iterative cycles of fact-gathering in order to generate and test clinical hypotheses. This has implications for the development of novel assessment tools, as well as professional development and education of novice SLTs. What this paper adds What is already known on the subject CSE practices are reportedly variable, which has led to calls for more stringent, standardized assessment tools. Emerging evidence suggests that this variation is non-random, but may arise from clinical reasoning processes. What this paper adds to existing knowledge We directly observed expert SLTs conducting CSEs and identified patterns in practice that were consistent across all CSEs evaluated. These patterns were consistent in structure, whereas the content of the assessment items varied and was tailored to individual patient presentation. Overall, expert SLTs engaged in balanced cycles of inductive hypothesis generation and deductive hypothesis-testing, a hallmark of good clinical assessment and practice. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? Ensuring quality CSE requires a more nuanced approach that considers the role of clinical reasoning in SLTs’ decision-making and the potential unintended negative consequences of standardized assessment tools. © 2020 Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists

AB  - This study aimed to examine the views of preservice science teachers on concept map use in a General Chemistry II class. The study was conducted with 47 preservice science teachers. In the study, an interview form grounded on determining their views on concept maps and comprised of open-ended questions, was used as the data collection tool. In analysis of the data acquired, content analysis was performed. As a result of the analysis of the data, the preservice teachers expressed positive views on concept map use. They stated that it might contribute to their learning and increase the permanence of the knowledge learned. Furthermore, they reported that they liked creating concept maps and among the concept map types they usually chose to create hierarchical concept maps. Most of the preservice teachers stated that they had to know the subject related to the concept map very well to create concept maps more easily, otherwise they might have a difficulty in the concept map creation process and thus concept maps should generally be used after a lecture. In addition the preservice teachers stated that they intended to use concept maps in their teaching experience. As a result, before concept maps are used in teaching, it is recommended to inform students about the creation of concept maps, to use them for re-purpose in teaching activities, and to include activities containing concept maps in textbooks. © 2021 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

AB  - A prerequisite relation describes a basic dependency relation between concepts in education, cognition and other fields. Especially, prerequisite relations among concepts play a very important role in various intelligent education applications, such as concept map extraction, learning object sequencing, reading order list generation. In this paper, we investigate the problem of extracting prerequisite relations among Wikipedia concepts. We take advantage of Wikipedia clickstream data and related concept sets to discover prerequisite relations among Wikipedia concepts. Evaluations on two datasets that include nine domains show that the proposed method can cover most of the concept pairs, and achieves significant improvements (+1.7–31.0% by Accuracy) comparing with existing methods. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Students of initial level programming courses generally face difficulties while learning the programming concepts. The learning analytics studies, in these courses, are mostly anecdotal on the aspect of assessment as less or no attention is given to assess learning at various cognitive levels of specific concepts. Furthermore, the existing work reflects deficiencies in examining the effect of learners' cognitive performance on subsequent stages of the course. This gap needs to be addressed by introducing more granular and methodical approaches of cognitive analysis for sustaining the programming courses effectively in computer science and associated disciplines. In this article, a framework-based approach is proposed for cognitive learning analytics on the concepts taught in initial level programming courses. The framework serves as a platform that provides structure to the concept data using the technique of concept mapping and examines learners' cognitive propagation on related concepts using assessment data. Learners' performance prediction has been examined on relatively higher-level programming concepts through the metrics established from the cognitive maps of learners, acquired by deploying the related layers of framework. Overall maximum prediction accuracy range obtained was 64.81% to 90.86%, which was better than the prediction accuracies presented in most of the related studies. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is the teacher's expertise gained since becoming a student. There are changes in PCK for prospective teacher students during lecture and changes can be seen based on the concept map. This study aims to analyze the changing profile of prospective PCK teachers based on concept maps. This study was conducted for biology education students at one of the private universities in West Java during the 2017/2018 school year. Participants are 6 people. Participants are asked to make a speciation concept map during evolution, micro teaching and PPL. Concept maps were analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. The results show changes in the concept map that includes changes in the form of concept maps from simple to complex, increasingly meaningful and easily understood as propositions, and only important concepts emerge. Based on this, PCK changes with increasing education and training experience of prospective teachers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Communication skills are needed to achieve success in learning because students will easily communicate various matters relating to learning material, in written form or verbally so that the level of academic ability possessed by students, so that students' academic ability level also increases. One of the learning model that can help student communication skills is the learning models Number Heads Together (NHT). This study aims to determine the effect of the Remap-NHT learning model on class XI students of SMAN 1 Sampang's communication skills. This research uses a quasi-experimental design method with a pretest- posttest nonequivalent control group design. The population in this study were all students of class XI IPA SMAN 1 Sampang. The sample of this research is class XI IPA 5 and class XI IPA 6. The class used as a control class is XI IPA 5 and the experimental class XI IPA 6. Data analysis used to analyze data communication skills is Anacova. This study's results are that there is an effect of the Reading Concept Map Number Head Together (Remap-NHT) learning model on communication skills with an increase of 72.41% of students in class XI Science of SMAN 1 Sampang. The next studies, to add a class positive control is by learning model NHT and remapped in order to compare the learning Reading Concept Map Number Heads Together (Remap-NHT), Reading Concept Map (Remap), Number Heads Together (NHT) and conventional so the Communication skills can be measured optimally. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based networks. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers, that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins dedicated to solving surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical-system-friendly big data is a critical issue. Preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for the input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules of digital twins. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human- and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study. © 2021 The Japan Society of Mechanical Engineers.

AB  - Higher-order thinking is crucial to inquiry learning. It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students’ inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students’ written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.

AB  - Collaboration is regarded as one of the core competences of the 21st century when it comes to complex problem solving. In response to high dropout rates among STEM students, we developed a digital-collaborative intervention on a difficult topic, MO theory, for first-year chemistry students. First, students work independently in a Digital Learning Environment (DLE). Afterwards, they collaborate in small groups and create Concept Maps on MO theory. We evaluate this intervention through knowledge tests, tests of attractiveness, cognitive load, and usability during the DLE and concept mapping process, as well as audio and screen recordings during the collaborative group processes. This paper presents the detailed study design together with results from a first study in January 2021, focusing on the practicability of the intervention and students’ feedback. Overall, each small group succeeded in creating a Concept Map. Students rated all phases of the intervention as attractive, with high usability and low cognitive load, although the interactive videos scored better for attractiveness and usability than the concept mapping process. On that basis, first adjustments for a second cycle of the intervention, which will be conducted in January 2022, were derived. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The presented research focuses on verifying the confluent application of concept mapping (CM) and socio-scientific issues (SSI) according to the value-laden and moral dilemma orientation to con-struct problem-solving performance. This research sets up some perspectives for all 146 participants, including 139 students and 7 experts. All findings reveal that the design of SSICM contexts includes a rebut-tal process and incense claim to improve students’ argument response (16.4%), to increase content knowledge and illuminate their science learning by argumentations. To develop an assessment tool with high validity and reliability (Cronbach’s α > .9) and find positive presentations of all learning attitudes in the SSICM context, learning environment and results will concern the best argumentation process. Students’ interview responses and SWOT analysis of teachers indicate that SSICM’s use of argument in the classroom is a real benefit. The research provided a better paradigm of attempts to combine analytical and academic hypotheses to explain literature sources by teachers, researchers, textbook developers, and editors. © 2021, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

AB  - Background: Innovative approaches are needed to maximize fit between the characteristics of evidence-based practices (EBPs), implementation strategies that support EBP use, and contexts in which EBPs are implemented. Standard approaches to implementation offer few ways to address such issues of fit. We characterized the potential for collaboration with experts from a relevant complementary approach, user-centered design (UCD), to increase successful implementation. Method: Using purposive and snowball sampling, we recruited 56 experts in implementation (n = 34) or UCD (n = 22). Participants had 5+ years of professional experience (M = 10.31), worked across many settings (e.g., healthcare, education, human services), and were mostly female (59%) and white (73%). Each participant completed a web-based concept mapping structured conceptualization task. They sorted strategies from established compilations for implementation (36 strategies) and UCD (30 strategies) into distinct clusters, then rated the importance and feasibility of each strategy. Results: We used multidimensional scaling techniques to examine patterns in the sorting of strategies. Based on conceptual clarity and fit with established implementation frameworks, we selected a final set of 10 clusters (i.e., groups of strategies), with five implementation-only clusters, two UCD-only clusters, and three trans-discipline clusters. The highest-priority activities (i.e., above-average importance and feasibility) were the trans-discipline clusters plus facilitate change and monitor change. Implementation and UCD experts sorted strategies into similar clusters, but each gave higher importance and feasibility ratings to strategies/clusters from their own discipline. Conclusions: In this concept mapping study, experts in implementation and UCD had perspectives that both converged (e.g., trans-discipline clusters, which were all rated as high-priority) and diverged (e.g., in importance/feasibility ratings). The results provide a shared understanding of the alignment between implementation science and UCD, which can increase the impact and sustainability of EBP implementation efforts. Implications for improved collaboration among implementation and UCD experts are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Introduction: Vertically integrating physiology into patient care has the potential to improve clinical reasoning. Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is a case-based teaching method that brings together students from all years of medical school to focus on linking clinical presentations to core basic science concepts including anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. In this study, we describe the implementation of CPGR at two different institutions in the United States and assess student-reported outcomes. Methods: We survey students who participated in CPGR at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S) and Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Subjects were queried across three domains: the benefits of attending, the impact of concept maps, and the impact of the mixed-learner environment. Results: Despite differences in session leadership and the underlying medical school curricula, conference attendees reported similar benefits at the two schools included in this study. Students overwhelmingly (92.9%) reported that remembering clinical presentations was easier when they understood the underlying physiology. They also reported gaining a true understanding of concepts that were previously memorized (87.5%). Both clinical (92.5%) and preclinical students (93.1%) valued the mixed-learner environment as a component of the conference. Discussion: By assuring a mixed-learner environment with near-peer interactions, using concept maps as a teaching tool, and rigorously linking clinical presentation and management to physiological concepts, we found that the key benefits of CPGR were replicable across different institutions, despite several local differences in how CPGR was implemented, led, and conducted. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy. © 2021 by The Regents of the University of California.

AB  - Argumentation skills are essential skills needed by students to deal with 21st century life. The implementation of a particular learning model can help students hone their argumentation skills. Reading-Concept Mapping-Numbered Heads Together (Remap-NHT) is a learning model of which syntax has the potential to promote students' argumentation skills. The current study aimed to investigate the effect of the Remap-NHT learning model on students' argumentation skills. This study was designed as a quasi-experiment using a nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design. This study's respondents were 100 eleventh grade students who came from three Natural Science Program classes at SMA Negeri 4 Malang, Indonesia, in the academic year of 2019/2020. This study's data were obtained using a pretest and a posttest that contained essay tests on Biology lessons. The participants' test answers were evaluated using an argumentation skill scoring rubric and analyzed using One-way ANCOVA. Before the ANCOVA analysis, normality and homogeneity tests had been conducted. The statistical analyses showed that there was a significant difference between learners in Remap-NHT, NHT, and conventional groups in terms of performance in argumentation skills. Among the three learning models, Remap-NHT was proven to improve students' argumentation skills compared to NHT and conventional. Therefore, Remap-NHT can be used as an alternative model to promote students' argumentation skills. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - Although medical education has historically emphasized the role and import-ance of basic science in clinical reasoning, educators have struggled to teach basic science to optimize its use for students. Concept mapping helps students develop relationships between basic and clinical science, which can enhance understanding of the material. Educators at the University of New England College of Osteopathic Medicine developed a weekly concept-mapping activity connecting biomedical principles with clinical signs, symp-toms, and laboratory values from a comprehensive clinical case. This activity elicits cross-disciplinary discussion, illustrates content integration by the students, and enhances faculty collaboration across disciplines. © 2020 American Osteopathic Association.

AB  - The organic two-semester undergraduate course at a public urban university began a new design about four years before the COVID-19 Pandemic. When the in-person classes were changed to virtual in March of 2020, the course curricula had already been impacted by incorporation of Open Education Resources (OER), Flipped Classrooms and Backward Design. The new content design was written through the lens of the Anchoring Chemical Concepts Map from the Examinations Institute of the American Chemical Society. These modifications made a more seamless transition from in-person to virtual classroom. New technologies were implemented, which not only matched the successes of the earlier modifications, but often enhanced opportunities for students seeking mastery of organic chemistry. The changes presented faculty with new windows into the student learning process that were unique to virtual learning adaptations. This chapter provides evidence of success, and modifications for future courses that likely will have a very different layout even with a return to in-person learning. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

AB  - This study aimed to analyze the effectiveness of concept maps on the academic achievements of Biology teacher candidates and the elimination of misconceptions comparing the method with the traditional rote learning method. The quasi-experimental design, specifically, the pre- and post-test control group type was used in this research to address the research questions. The research was carried out with 60 Biology teacher candidates. Achievement test and diagnostic test were used as data collection tools throughout the research. SPSS version 20 software was used to analyze the obtained quantitative data. Independent samples t-test was used to determine, whether there was a significant difference between the control and experimental group students’ level of prior knowledge regarding the subject of protein synthesis. The findings revealed no statistically significant difference between the groups in pre-test (ρ > 0.05). However, the findings revealed a statistically significant difference between the groups, in the post-test, in favor of the concept map method used for the experiment group (ρ < 0.05). The increase in the post-test scores of the experiment group students indicated that the teaching method based on concept maps positively affected the students’ academic achievement and elimination of misconceptions. Research indicated that students could not establish a correct relationship between the concepts of DNA, RNA, mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, nucleus, chromosome, gene, genetic code, codon, anticodon, translation, transcription, ribosome, protein, and amino acid terms taught in protein synthesis subject. It was concluded that the areas of use for concept maps should not be limited as a teaching tool, but should be further extended to for determining misconceptions, eliminating misconceptions, and evaluating the instruction. © 2021 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question “Who am I?,” was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom. © 2021 The Author(s).

AB  - Greater attention to promoting entrepreneurial mindset and innovation among STEM disciplines in recent years enhances the potential role for science and engineering majors as changemakers. The efforts by the emerging and growing Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) community in recent years bear resemblance to and overlaps with the efforts of engineering educators in terms of cultivating entrepreneurial mindset among college students. Physics Innovation and Entrepreneurship (PIE) efforts at Loyola University Maryland is shaped by the launch of two NSF funded initiatives; the Pathways to Innovation in 2015 and the PIPELINE Network; an NSF collaborative research grant in 2016. One of the outcomes of these efforts is a new course on Technical Innovation and Entrepreneurship, a cross listed course by Physics, Computer Science, and engineering. In this course students are introduced to innovation and entrepreneurial mindset through User Innovation concept, which is the focus of this report. Physics, computer science, and engineering students, as well as those majoring in communication, business, chemistry, biology, and psychology often take this as an elective course. The User Innovation module introduces Innovation and Entrepreneurship (I&E) concepts in context of students' passion and their personal experience instead of using textbook definitions. Students are engaged in active learning practices that guides them through a journey, starting with User Innovation module and ending with a team project. In this process students identify needs, pains, and issues they care about, and concluding with a prototype developed through a team project that represent solutions to student defined problems. Teams project members collaboratively work on the necessary steps for launching a startup based on the team project product. They develop and submit a team project portfolio that document the challenges they faced, and their progress and achievements, while documenting how their prototype was treated to launch a startup. The success of the team project is measured by the quality of the prototype created, ability to adhere to a project timeline, quality of the written project report and documentations, the oral presentation, and the team project portfolio. Future plans include leveraging concept map to assess the impact of the whole course as well as the User Innovation module on students' perception and attitudes about entrepreneurial mindset. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - Education is critical for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 concentration, but collaboration between countries is also critical. It is a global problem in which we cannot isolate ourselves. Our students must learn to collaborate in seeking solutions together with others from other countries. Thus, the research question of this study is whether interactive cross-border science classes with energy experiments are feasible and can increase awareness of energy efficiency among middle school students. We designed and tested an interactive cross-border class between Chilean and Peruvian eighth-grade classes. The classes were synchronously connected and all students did experiments and answered open-ended questions on an online platform. Some of the questions were designed to check conceptual understanding whereas others asked for suggestions of how to develop their economies while keeping CO2 air concentration at acceptable levels. In real time, the teacher reviewed the students’ written answers and the concept maps that were automatically generated based on their responses. Students peer-reviewed their classmates’ suggestions. This is part of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education project on energy efficiency using APEC databases. We found high levels of student engagement, where students discussed not only the cross-cutting nature of energy, but also its relation to socioeconomic development and CO2 emissions, and the need to work together to improve energy efficiency. In conclusion, interactive cross-border science classes are a feasible educational alternative, with potential as a scalable public policy strategy for improving awareness of energy efficiency among the population. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Accurate clinical decision-making of dentists should be based on their knowledge and experience. In the past 10 years, interest in competency-based dentistry education has rapidly increased, but there has been little attention paid to methods of improving dental education competency. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical presentation education model that provides opportunities for students to practice problem-solving from the moment they greet the patient so that students can obtain the practical experience of competency-based education and the effectiveness of this model can be confirmed through pilot test. Methods: This article is divided two parts: First, developing the clinical presentation dental education model (CPDEM) and Second, a pilot study adopted CPDEM. To confirm the effectiveness of this model, the students' satisfaction, their perception of self-achievement were analysed. Results: Clinical presentation dental education model has been developed to provide practice-related education experience and provide linkage between basic science and clinical science. The result of applying this education model to 10 students as a pilot test was shown an overall high satisfaction level. In addition, self-achievement students’ reported of all intended competencies was higher than for non-participating students of this model. Conclusions: This study focuses on practical education centring on clinical presentation. This model could get a meaningful and realistic experiences through the practice using clinical presentation of patients, use their metacognition for organizing and memorizing the patient's case by using concept map. It can be used as a future instructional method to enhance students' competency. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons A/S. Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd

AB  - As an ability to support claims by collecting evidence and establishing connections between evidence and claims, the cultivation of argumentation ability plays an important role in science education. In this study, an online concept map tool was introduced into argumentation instruction separately with the method of flipped classroom. A control group post-Test true-experiment was conducted in a classroom with 79 pre-service teachers. The results showed that the total score and all aspects of the experimental group were generally superior to the control group. However, no significant difference was found between the two groups in the post-Test. For this, this study analyzes the possible reasons. In addition, the students showed a positive attitude towards learning using concept maps. Implications for future research are discussed.  © 2020 ACM.

AB  - The lack of students' critical thinking skills especially in Science can affect the Malaysia education system. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of Collaborative Concept Mapping (CCM) and Individual Concept Mapping (ICM) in improving students' critical thinking skills in science subjects. This study used the quasi-experimental research design that involved 189 form one students from public secondary schools in Malaysia. The manipulated variable in this study is teaching approaches, which includes Collaborative Concept Mapping (CCM), Individual Concept Mapping (ICM) and conventional method (CM). Meanwhile, the dependent variable is students' critical thinking skills in Science. Data was collected using critical thinking skills diagnostic tests and analysed using one-way ANOVA test. The one-way ANOVA indicated that the students in CCM group showed significantly higher level of critical thinking skills as compared to those in the ICM and CM groups. While, there is no significant difference in the level of critical thinking skills between students in ICM and CM groups. Therefore, CCM is effective in fostering students' critical thinking skills compare to ICM and CM teaching approaches. CCM can be used as an alternative teaching approach in science classroom to enhance students' critical thinking skills. © 2020 Published by ISRES Publishing

AB  - This study adopted a quasi-experimental design with the support of qualitative information to investigate the impact of the mobile microscope on students’ science learning outcomes in a laboratory setting. The duration of the educational experiment was 5 weeks. Research participants comprised 56 third graders from two different classes at a public elementary school in Taiwan. Two classes with an equal number of students formed the experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group employed mobile microscopes to support their scientific inquiries, whereas students in the control group used only tablet computers to facilitate their science learning. A standardized test was developed to measure students’ basic understanding of botany. Additionally, semi-structured concept mapping was employed as an alternative non-standardized test to evaluate students’ natural science learning. The quantitative findings indicated a significant instructional effect in the students’ concept mapping but not in the standardized test. The qualitative results revealed that mobile microscopes might motivate students to actively engage in knowledge discussion and sharing during plant observation. © 2021 by the authors.

AB  - Objectives: There are currently no recommendations on following the ketogenic diet (KD) in the context of diabetes and, therefore, health-care professionals may not be comfortable in supporting this dietary regimen. In this qualitative study, we aim to understand the perspective of patients with diabetes when following the KD, particularly with regard to reasons for starting the diet, motivators, support systems, sources of information and challenges. Methods: Adults diagnosed with type 1 or type 2 diabetes who followed a KD for ≥3 months were recruited for inclusion in this study. Semistructured interviews were conducted, audio recorded and transcribed. Themes were analyzed using concept mapping until theme saturation was achieved. Results: Participants were 54.5 (standard deviation 10.1) years old, on average, and had been following the KD for 6 to 19 (median 5) months; 43% were male and 79% had type 2 diabetes. The main motivation to start the diet was to improve blood glucose control or to reduce/stop taking diabetes medications, followed by weight loss and diabetes reversal. Participants reported benefits of the diet, such as improved glycemic control, weight loss and satiety, which appeared to strongly prevail over challenges, such as lack of support from health-care professionals and lack of information sources. Most participants considered the KD as a normalized way of eating that they would continue for the rest of their lives. Conclusions: A wide range of reported benefits, either expected or that emerged, strongly motivated individuals to follow the KD despite the lack of safety information and/or support. Further studies are needed to establish guidelines that health-care professionals can use to provide direction for individuals with diabetes who wish to follow the KD. © 2020 Canadian Diabetes Association

AB  - The research aims to calculate the increase of student's Concept Map (CM) scores through the implementation of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The research is a classroom action. Research procedures include planning, observation, implementation, and reflection. The subjects were 34 X grade students. The data were collected by observation, assessment, interviews, and documentation. CM scores were calculated as a percentage based on expert CM. The research data consisted of the percentage of students' CM scores, performance assessment, the implementation of PBL syntax, interviews, and documentation of the learning process. The validity test used data triangulation. The analysis techniques are through reduction, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The results show that the percentage of CM scores in the pre-cycle, cycle I, and cycle II, respectively have a range of values of 4.62-20.80%; 11.56-24.25%; and 12.14-30.86% with an average increase in the first cycle is 10.96%, and the second cycle is 4.06%. The increase in the average percentage of CM score is supported by the linear increase in the average components of H, P, B, and E, thus the application of PBL is able to increase the percentage of CM scores based on the linear increase in the average components of H, P, B, and E. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In Trinidad and Tobago, occupational therapy is an emerging profession with limitations in the number of practitioners and the scope of practice. With the development of a new Master of Science Occupational Therapy programme in the country, the profession is continuously growing. There has been an increased demand for culturally relevant research to build the occupational therapy evidence base locally. However, the narrow range of occupational therapy literature in the country makes it difficult to highlight research gaps and decipher what research areas should be prioritised to best impact occupational therapy practice at present. This group concept mapping study is aimed at identifying priority areas for occupational therapy research in Trinidad and Tobago from the perspectives of occupational therapy students and practitioners. Participants brainstormed and contributed specific research ideas they would like to see developed in the country. Individually, participants sorted these ideas into themes and rated each idea based on perceived importance and feasibility. Using the GroupWisdom™ software, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to the sort data to create idea clusters within a concept map. Rating values were analysed to determine priority research themes within the concept map. The resulting concept map illustrated seven research priorities: Contextualising Practitioner Development, The Realities of Emerging OT Practice, Localising Mental Health OT, Occupation and Participation of Children and Youth, School-based OT in the Local Context, OT with Special Populations, and OT Contributions to the Public Health Sector. These findings represent the research needs of the occupational therapy profession in Trinidad and Tobago and will help to focus future researchers' efforts to expand the local evidence base.  © 2021 Savannah Murray-Mendes et al.

AB  - This aim of this project is to improve students' abilities in solving chemical engineering problems by implementing, in the chemical engineering curriculum, a consistent and effective approach to problem solving. The key concept is to foster in students an understanding of the structure of chemical engineering problems from early courses, and to implement the same approach throughout their undergraduate training by reinforcing a consistent methodology. The project is supported by surveys on students' confidence level in problem solving which are used to adapt our teaching to students' needs. In the present contribution, an overview of the project is given and potential applications of a proposed concept map throughout the curriculum is discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - This study aimed to identify what male coaches of elite female team sport athletes want to know about the menstrual cycle and its influence on athlete health and performance. Using a mixed-methods concept mapping approach, 18 male coaches of Australian female elite football-codes brainstormed what they wanted to know about the menstrual cycle to work more effectively with female athletes. Ideas were sorted into groups of similar ideas and rated for importance and influence. Thirty-eight unique statements emerged from the brainstorming. These were organised into five clusters/topics following multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis: 1) How does training need to be managed; 2) How is physical performance impacted; 3) What are the medical and dietary considerations; 4) When and how should we communicate with athletes; and 5) How are athletes affected psychologically and emotionally. These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive education framework to improve the knowledge of and practices related to the menstrual cycle. This education should 1) facilitate better recognition and referral of female athletes regarding menstrual cycle dysfunction and related health concerns; 2) encourage collaboration between athletes, coaches, and medical and dietary professionals; and 3) promote effective communication between athletes and coaches about the menstrual cycle. © The Author(s) 2021.

AB  - Introduction Health literacy research has focused predominantly on the adult population, and much less is understood about this concept from an adolescent perspective. The tools currently available to measure adolescent health literacy have been adapted from adult versions. This limits their applicability to young people because of the developmental characteristics that impact on adolescents' behaviour, including impulse control and judgement skills. This protocol describes the intended development and validity testing of a questionnaire to measure health literacy in adolescents. Methods and analysis This protocol describes this mixed methods study that has three phases: the first phase will involve grounded research with adolescents using qualitative group interviews, co-design and concept mapping workshops to understand what health and healthy behaviours mean to adolescents and to explore their health literacy needs and the potential domains for the questionnaire. The draft health literacy domains identified will be presented to the youth advisory panel, and the questionnaire will be altered based on their feedback. Cognitive pretesting of the questionnaire items will also be conducted. Phase 2 will involve piloting the questionnaire to a two-stage random sample of young people in five urban and rural schools in Ireland. Test-retest reliability will be conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis will also be conducted to analyse the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Phase 3 will involve the questionnaire being rolled out to a nationally representative sample of adolescents (n=6052) in Ireland to assess their levels of health literacy. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval to conduct this study has been granted from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee - Sciences (LS-20-08). Informed assent from adolescents and informed consent from parents/guardians will be sought. The findings of this research will be disseminated at national and international conferences, as well as through publication in peer-reviewed journals.  © 2020 Author(s)

AB  - The research aimed to calculate the increase of student's hierarchy concept map (CM) scores through the modification of problem analysis and learning issue (2nd stage of problem-based learning (PBL)) using question instructional techniques. The type of research is classroom action. Research subjects were 36 X grade students. Research procedures: planning, action, observation, and reflection. Research data is the percentage of hierarchy CM score which is calculated based on the Expert CM score according to the material in each cycle. Data validity is done by confirming the percentage of hierarchy CM score with the result of interviews and documentation of the learning process in each cycle. The analysis techniques use reduction, presentation, and drawing a conclusion. The results show that the average increase in hierarchy percentage scores from pre-cycles to cycle I was 25% and cycle I to II was 38%. The number of students who experienced an increase in percentage hierarchy scores from pre-cycle to cycle I was 83% and cycle I to II by 90%, thus the modification of instructional techniques in problem analysis and learning issues PBL increased the students' CM hierarchy score. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In constructivist pedagogy, students create their own meaning of the course material. One way for students to represent connections between ideas is by creating a concept map. This paper describes different approaches to using concept maps as a study tool in undergraduate fluid mechanics courses at two different institutions. The two instructors worked together to create a concept map of the topics covered in the courses, which had similar learning outcomes and covered most of the same topics. The goal of creating this concept map was to provide the students with a visual representation of how the different topics were related. At the first institution, the instructor-created concept map was used primarily as a visual aid (passive approach). The instructor showed the map at regular intervals in class, where the map grew as students learned new material. At the second institution during the following semester, students were encouraged to create individual maps, which could be used as an aid during assessments (active approach). The instructor-created map was presented in class after allowing the students to develop their own maps. No significant differences in course performance were found compared with courses taught by the same instructors when concept maps were not used. Concept maps were found to be a useful tool for connecting and organizing course topics for both students and instructors. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - The effectiveness of 21st century learning emphasizes higher order thinking skills, one of which is analytical thinking. The analytical thinking-based module used includes indicators based on the integration of analytical-thinking aspects and Concept Map components. This study aimed to measure improvement in student learning outcomes using Concept Map through an analytical thinking-based module. The research method used was quasi-experimental with a field test design in the form of a pretest-posttest non-equivalent control group design. Participants were 66 students divided into control class using conventional modules and experimental class using analytical thinking-based modules. The calculation of students' Concept Map scores is based on the Concept Map experts. The data were analyzed using the Ancova test. The effectiveness results showed: 1) the average score of the Concept Map of the experimental class (81.39%) was higher than the control class (47.89%), 2) the average score of the Concept Map component in the experimental class was higher than the control class, but the cross-link score obtained the lowest score. Concept Map is a powerful tool for educating new knowledge and supporting learning outcomes because has a positive effect on improving students' learning outcomes and assessment of long-life learning in the teaching and learning process. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In this project, we sought to uncover the cognitive processes and skills that are involved in completing a theoretical physics project. Theoretical physics is often portrayed as a field requiring individual genius and can seem inaccessible to undergraduate students, as well as the public. We drew upon the foundations of Cognitive Task Analysis and completed semi-structured interviews with eleven theoretical physics faculty members from several different research institutions who specialized in subfields including quantum optics, biophysics, computational astrophysics, and string theory. We analyzed the processes and skills of these physicists, focusing on an analysis of idea origin, which is typically the first cognitive process within a project, and how it was connected to collaboration and motivation. We used concept maps to organize these codes and portray the factors that influence the creation of project ideas. We found that motivation and collaboration are fundamental determinants of project ideas and their origins, which contradicts the lone genius stereotype. These findings on cognitive processes and skills can help us understand how to better prepare students to do theoretical physics research. Finally, the information gathered during this project may be useful for improving the public understanding of theoretical physics, dispelling the belief that the field requires genius and making it accessible to more students.

AB  - The chapter begins with the origins of concept maps as a tool to promote constructivist learning, an educational philosophy and practice, and is followed by a concept map taxonomy. A definition of concept maps is provided and the main differences between Mind Maps(iD), Thinking Maps®, and Concept Maps are discussed with Thinking Maps classified as a type of concept map that is separate and different from both other maps. The chapter then offers a second definition of the term "concept maps, ″ with a detailed discussion of Thinking Maps resulting in a new taxonomy of knowledge or concept maps. The authors then investigate integrating concept maps with cognitive styles theory to determine if concept mapping might have a neuro-psychological basis and if mapping theory can be related to different academic fields and professions. The chapter concludes that the use of concept mapping can promote more holistic and effective teaching, learning, and practice in STEM education. © 2021, IGI Global.

AB  - The Introduction to Programming and Computation at Wayne State University (WSU), which is a required foundational course in MATLAB taken by six different engineering majors, was not perceived well by students, which affected engineering retention. At the onset of the course, many students were apprehensive about the material. From discussions with students, we learned that a number of students did not see connections between this course and courses in their major, or the usefulness of the material in their future careers. Beginning in Fall 2016 several pedagogical changes were incorporated into the course. The full study collected student data to see the effects each aspect had on different student groups. This work in progress paper will examine the student's perceptions of course structure and support based on their demographic information. Prior to this study, the course was taught in 70-100 person sections primarily in a lecture style. Topics in the course were only vaguely connected to their chosen disciple and thus students would struggle to find the benefit in the course. Many students had never programmed before and found the thought process completely foreign. As has been seen at other universities, this contributed to students' lack of engagement and dissatisfaction [1]. Females and minorities are chronically underrepresented in engineering [2] and industry is continually calling for additional engineers [3, 4]. Extensive research has been done on ways to increase student engagement and success in STEM fields [5-7]. The 2012 President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology report Engage to Excel lists these as strongly supported practices: small group discussion and peer instruction, testing, one-minute papers, clickers, problem-based learning, case studies, analytical challenges before lectures, group tests, problem sets in groups, concept mapping, writing with peer review, computer simulations and games, and combinations of active learning methods [8]. Studies have shown that female engineering students cite the availability of external support and group work as supporting their success [9]. We capitalized on that foundation by incorporating a wide range of active learning strategies into an entry-level class creating a more interactive environment to support all students' success. In addition to the classroom environment, student motivations and perceptions can affect outcomes for programming courses. Previous work has been done on several student factors. Initial motivation, goal orientation, and instrumentality were studied by Shell et al as contributing factors [10]. Bergin and Reilly reported on the role of intrinsic and extrinsic motivations and self-efficacy in learning programming [11]. Duckworth has reviewed the role of grit and self-control [12]. Data was collected in this study related to these topics, retention, and achievement of learning outcomes and is currently being analyzed for future papers. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results. © 2020 IEEE.

AB  - Developing students’ ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students’ recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students’ thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students’ representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - [Work in Progress] The grid of the (near-) future is envisioned as an intelligent system consisting of millions of smart devices and interconnected decision-makers that can be monitored, supervised, and controlled in real-time. This emerging paradigm calls for a revamping of the power and energy engineering curriculum, with the goal of developing a future workforce with strong foundational skills in not only traditional power systems topics, but also in renewable energy and distributed resources grid integration and in data analytics. This paper presents the vision and the preliminary work of an ongoing engineering education project aimed at improving students' skill sets in renewable energy-integrated power distribution system analysis with data analytics. The project will develop an integrated research-oriented power engineering curriculum that uses active and situated learning pedagogy. This paper presents the preliminary assessment methodology used by the project team to evaluate the current curriculum's effectiveness in developing students' conceptual knowledge of these emerging concepts. Concept maps are used and a scoring rubric is being developed. The data gathered through this graded concept maps will guide the project team in their curriculum redesign.  © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - An understanding of chemistry is critical for many engineering disciplines. Students taking an introductory environmental engineering course at the University of Wisconsin- Madison (with a typical cohort of 100 undergraduate students) have historically struggled to overcome cognitive and affective challenges related to chemistry. Analysis of historical data confirmed that many students were not able to master certain key chemistry concepts during the course. To improve attitudes towards chemistry and student performance on chemistry problems, we implemented a week-long case study on the Flint Water Crisis. The case study included short on-line videos related to the history of Flint, MI, and the chemistry of lead in distribution systems. The unit also included two lectures: one covering the chemistry and another telling the story of the crisis that unfolded after the water source was switched in Flint. Students used classroom response systems, concept maps, and minute-papers to engage with the material during lectures. We dedicated a 2-hour problem solving session for students to answer quantitative questions designed to assess learning gains. Students also completed a writing assignment to describe the chemistry behind the Flint water crisis and to suggest ways for preventing another 'Flint' from occurring. Based on student assessments of their learning gains (SALG), 98% of students reported good or great gains in their understanding of the Flint Water Crisis. Additionally, 78% of students reported that their understanding of chemistry improved (a fair amount or a great deal) and 75% of students reported that their attitudes towards chemistry improved (a fair amount or a great deal) because of the Flint Water Crisis Case Study. Student writing assignments demonstrated that they met learning outcomes related to the Flint Water Crisis and 91% of students responded that the writing assignment was beneficial to their learning (a fair amount or a great deal). We also compared the performance of the cohort that included the Flint Water Crisis Case Study to a cohort that did not include the case study. On final exam questions, students who were taught the Flint Water Crisis performed significantly better on an acid-base chemistry problem (p < 0.05). While the change in mean performance on a redox chemistry question was not significantly different, the number of students who performed poorly on the question decreased. Students also identified the components of the case study that they found to be most beneficial. Based on these results, we propose several modifications for teaching the Flint Water Crisis to future cohorts. This study demonstrates that high-impact case studies can improve learning outcomes for engineering students. In our study, both cognitive and affective learning outcomes improved for chemistry-related outcomes in an introductory environmental engineering course. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that including writing assignments with case studies can benefit student learning. Case studies may be especially beneficial for motivating students to engage with and learn material that could otherwise be deemed as unimportant for their chosen field of study. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - Background: The unique immunomodulatory capacity of helminth parasites has been investigated as a novel strategy in the prevention of allograft rejection after transplantation. This review was conducted to fully evaluate the specific effects of helminth therapy on allograft survival reported in published studies of animal models of allogeneic transplantation. Method: Following PRISMA protocol guidelines, a literature search was conducted using PubMed, MEDLINE via OvidSP, along with additional manual searches of selected reference lists. Publications describing helminth intervention within allograft transplantation models were screened for relevance to eligibility criteria. Primary and secondary outcomes were extracted using standardized data collection tables. The SYRCLE risk of bias assessment tool was used for quality assessment. Due to heterogeneity of study designs, meta-analysis could not be performed; rather outcomes are presented as a narrative synthesis with concept mapping. This review was registered in PROSPERO with ID: CRD42018097175. Results: The literature search generated 1,443 publications, which after screening for relevance to the eligibility criteria yielded 15 publications for qualitative analysis. All 15 publications reported improvement to allograft survival as a result of helminth therapy. This prolonged allograft survival was not significantly different when helminth-derived products were used compared to live infection. However, the extent of positive impact on allograft survival was noted to be dependent on study design factors, such as the chronicity of the live helminth infection, allograft type and the species/genus of helminth selected. Conclusion: Both live and product-based helminth therapy have potential applications as novel immune regulators or adjuncts for the prevention of allograft rejection. However, there were differences in efficacy between different worms and preparations of worm-derived products. Therefore, further studies are required to determine the most appropriate worm for a specific allograft, to elucidate the optimal dose and route of administration, and to better understand the modulation of immune responses that can mediate tolerance. © Copyright © 2020 Kiss, Burns, Donnelly and Hawthorne.

AB  - Learning metabolic pathways is vital for understanding biochemical processes and all of their implications for life. Their learning in the virtual environment is complex and generative learning strategies, such as the construction of online conceptual maps, can help in this process. This article presents a proposal for the collaborative construction of virtual concept maps on metabolism by students in the CMap Cloud browser application (free). A sequence of steps is suggested, which include online group brainstorming and discussions, peer assessment, and teachers feedback. This proposal is flexible and can be adapted to the didactic and technological reality of each teacher. © 2021 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB  - Giving and receiving peer feedback is seen as an important vehicle for deep learning. Defining assessment criteria is a first step in giving feedback to peers and can play an important role in feedback providers’ learning. However, there is no consensus about whether it is better to ask students to think about assessment criteria themselves or to provide them with ready-made assessment criteria. The current experimental study aims at answering this question in a secondary school STEM educational context, during a physics lesson in an online inquiry learning environment. As a part of their lesson, participants (n = 93) had to give feedback on two concept maps, and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions—being provided or not being provided with assessment criteria. Students’ post-test scores, the quality of feedback given, and the quality of students’ own concept maps were analyzed to determine if there was an effect of condition on feedback providers’ learning. Results did not reveal an advantage of one condition over the other in terms of learning gains. Possible implications for practice and directions for further research are discussed. © 2020, The Author(s).

AB  - Industry 4.0 relevant systems (eg, cyber-physical systems, digital twins, and alike) need digitized knowledge to function. Before digitizing knowledge, a fundamental question arises: What is knowledge? In order to answer this question, this study first reviews the definitions of knowledge found in the extant literature of epistemology, engineering design, manufacturing, organization science, information science, and education science. Since the definitions reported so far are not succinct and suffer circularity, this study overcomes this by introducing a three-element-based definition of knowledge—a piece knowledge consists of three elements defined as claim, provenance, and inference. This results in four types of knowledge defined as definitional, deductive, inductive, and creative knowledge, and each type of knowledge is again divided into some categories. Some real-life scenarios relevant to engineering design and manufacturing are used to clarify the proposed knowledge types/categories; the relevant pieces of knowledge are represented by knowledge graphs (concept maps) for the sake of digitization. The myriad proximal and distal relationships between knowledge and other relevant entities (human/machine learning, logical inferences, experimental data, analytical results, creative thinking, and cognitive reflections) become succinct and transparent due to the proposed definition of knowledge. Consequently, this study establishes the fundamentals of developing sophisticated methods and tools for the advancement of Industry 4.0. © 2020 The Authors.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in the worldwide disruption of teaching and learning in main stream schools and in institutes of higher learning. Singapore was not spared. With the closure of schools in early April, it was imminent that the delivery and assessment of our freshman general chemistry course must be overhauled for the new semester. While the delivery of Home-based Learning (HBL) was a challenge for all educators, it was a mammoth roadblock for chemistry courses because of laboratory classes. Besides being thrusted to learn and use new technology tools for online lessons, instructors also had to quickly explore and design alternative assessments to substitute in-person written examinations and tests. This paper documents the struggles that played out in the decision to implement concept map assessments and “split-half” laboratory classes for safe distancing. Although these interventions are not novel, we confronted tensions as we sought to address academic integrity, administrative guidelines, and our own inadequacy particularly in concept map assessments. In light of positive and negative feedback from both staff and students, lessons were drawn to enhance future implementation and for further research. © 2020 by the authors.

AB  - Introduction: Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a high-yield undergraduate medical education topic that lends itself to adaptability of content. We used a CF case paired with activities to deliver content in a near-peer teaching session. First-year (M1) and second-year (M2) medical students contributed acquired knowledge of protein structure and obstructive lung disease, respectively, to generate a concept map and address discussion questions. Methods: Combined groups of M1 and M2 students reviewed a CF case and a concept map prompt. For 30 minutes, they created a concept map describing connections between molecular biology and clinical manifestations. We summarized by reviewing concept maps and discussion questions. The efficacy of the session was determined by comparing exam performance of class attenders and nonattenders (M2) and performance on questions related and unrelated to the exercise (M1). We also determined students' perception of the session and incorporation of additional core competencies. Results: M2 students' performance was 3.8% higher (p = .296) and M1 students' performance was 1.8% higher (p = .286) than their respective controls. Students commented positively on the exercise and perceived more than one core competency as part of the session. Discussion: Although there was no significant improvement in exam performance, this curriculum used near-peer teaching to reinforce previously learned material and apply recently acquired material in an engaging format without detriment to either group. This method can be adapted to different learner groups and provides an opportunity to deliver and assess other core medical competencies. © 2020 LeClair and Binks.

AB  - In the Cultivating Diverse Talent in STEM project, funded by the National Science Foundation in the United States, new assessments were developed, field tested, used to identify students with exceptional talent in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), and compared with existing methods (grade point average [GPA], letters of recommendation, self-statements). Students identified by both methods participated in an internship program in laboratories of scientists on the campus of an R1 university in the Southwest. Existing methods limited the diversity of students identified. Significant differences were found between students identified by the new methods (M2) and existing methods (M1) in GPA, ethnicity, and parent level of education. Ethnicity differences may be due to the ethnic makeup of the partner schools, but differences in GPA and parent level of education cannot be attributed to the location of schools. Although GPAs of M1 students were significantly higher (3.71) than those of M2 students (3.07) and M1 students came from higher income groups and schools in higher income areas, the M2 students scored higher on all the performance assessments of creative problem-solving and at similar levels on concept maps and mathematical problem-solving. Studies of the usefulness and psychometric properties of the new assessments are needed with different groups and in different contexts. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - Background: One approach to enhancing the pedagogy of science education is to employ academics who are not only science-trained but also engaged in education research. As some academics begin their Scholarship of Teaching and Learning research careers with a pure science background, shifting in disciplinary perspectives can be a source of professional tension. The pedagogic frailty model provides a framework that helps us to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching improvements by maintaining a simultaneous focus on critical areas that are thought to impede academic development. Purpose: This paper draws attention to the importance of disciplinary crossover by uncovering and comparing academics’ teaching perspectives, views and beliefs from three disciplines: natural science (chemistry), social science (education) and science education. Method: Through a case study design using the pedagogic frailty model and concept map-mediated interviews as a tool, three academics engaged in a non-linear discourse in which their conceptions could be visualised and analysed. Findings and Discussion: Analysis of the case study interviews indicated that the academics’ conceptions of teaching were highly individualised. The discourse surrounding the curriculum, and the embeddedness of and connection between pedagogy and discipline, were both subject-sensitive and influenced by professional backgrounds and research areas. On the other hand, because they operated under the same institutional values and regulations, we found a considerable overlap in terms of how the academics perceived the tensions between research and teaching and academic leadership. By comparing three academics who were at a different stage in the journey from disciplinary experts (chemistry) to teaching expert (education), we were able to uncover and understand more about the ways that the teaching environment impacted upon their practices. The science educator shared aspects of the other two perspectives, which suggests that his profile was a transitory state in comparison with the chemist and the educationist. Conclusion: The findings provide a glimpse of the distinctive nature of the values that underpin teaching and offer insights that can be used to promote dialogue about quality enhancement in science education. © 2020 NFER.

AB  - With the expansion of maker programs in school and out-of-school settings, investigating the connections between making and learning is important for many reasons, not least to build the evidence base needed by educators committed to its practice. In this paper, we argue that, as a relatively new area of inquiry, studies of making can benefit from close dialogue between researchers and the practitioners who have pioneered and continue to develop the practice. We share how a research-practice partnership sought to amplify the voices of informal educators leading afterschool maker programs to address the research question: How can afterschool maker programs support student learning that is valued and relevant to the school day? We show how the research-practice partnership helped to refine a pedagogical framework describing learning dimensions of making and tinkering in ways that reflect the values and expert knowledge of informal educators committed to liberatory forms of education for young people, particularly those from socio-economically and racially marginalized communities. © Copyright © 2020 Bevan, Ryoo, Vanderwerff, Wilkinson and Petrich.

AB  - Students' understanding of genetics and its associated mechanisms can be a difficult task. Though there are several instructional approaches to enhance the teaching and learning of genetics among medical, nursing, midwifery, and other allied health students in Ghana, little is known about the use of concept mapping as a teaching strategy. This study aimed to investigate the effect of using concept maps to enhance the teaching and learning of genetics among midwifery students in Ghana. We conducted an experimental study using the pre-test/post-test control group design. Fifty-one (51) midwifery students (females) in Ghana were voluntarily recruited and randomly assigned into either experimental or control groups using a ‘balloting method.' In the pretest phase, the groups were first administered a Genetics Achievement Test (GAT) to measure their understanding of basic genetic concepts. The experimental and control groups received two (2)-weeks of lessons in genetics using concept mapping and lecture methods respectively during the intervention phase. Following the intervention phase, a posttest (GAT) was administered a week after the intervention to determine whether concept-mapping as a teaching strategy significantly improved the learning and achievement of students. Data analysis was conducted using JASP software (Version 0.14.1). Results showed that there was no significant difference in GAT scores between the groups during the pretest phase, (t = 0.763, df = 45, ρ = 0.194, d = 0.214). However, the experiment group performed better in the GAT than the control group, (t = 9.402, df = 45, ρ <. 001, d = 2.634). In conclusion, the concept mapping teaching strategy is recommended as a useful approach for the teaching and learning of genetics. Teachers can blend this method with the traditional lecture approach to improve learning outcomes among nursing students. © 2021 Academic Publishing House Researcher s.r.o. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Purpose: Fatigue is a disabling and prevalent feature of many long-term conditions. Orthostatic dizziness is a commonly experienced by those with fatigue. The purpose was; to evaluate factors contributing to successful delivery of a novel group exercise program designed for people with chronic fatigue and orthostatic symptoms and identify targets to improve future program content and delivery. Research methods: We used group concept mapping methodology. Participants of the exercise program with a long-term physical health condition and chronic fatigue- contributed ideas in response to a focus question. They sorted these ideas into themed piles and rated them for importance and success of the program delivery. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were applied to the sort data to produce ideas clusters within a concept map. Value ratings were compared to evaluate the success of the program. Results: The resulting concept map depicted seven key themed clusters of ideas: Exercises, Group atmosphere, Physical benefits, Self-management of symptoms, Acceptance and Education. Value plots of the rating data identified important and successful conceptual ideas. Conclusions: The concept maps have depicted key concepts relating to the successful delivery of a novel exercise program for people with fatigue and identified specific targets for future program enhancements.Implications for rehabilitation Orthostatic symptoms are common in those with fatigue and might be a target for group-based exercise programs. People with fatigue value a group-based exercise program that targets orthostatic symptoms. The key concepts of a group-based exercise program valued by those with fatigue are the exercises, group atmosphere, physical benefits, self-management support, acceptance, education and support with looking forwards following the program. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Safe, effective and ethical clinical decision-making in nursing depends on critical thinking, yet there is no consensus on the educational strategies that are most effective in developing and refining this foundational skill. A qualitative inquiry among graduating Bachelor of Science in Nursing students sought to determine whether one such educational strategy, an operationalized critical thinking framework, would assist nursing students to better understand acute care patients' complex profiles. The Safe Care Framework™, consisting of the ‘Concept Map Template’ and the ‘Priority Setting Tool Template’, was developed using a constructivist pedagogical approach. The framework illustrates and operationalizes the systematic critical thinking processes that expert nurses use to provide safe, comprehensive care. Thematic analysis of qualitative survey results revealed the following three main themes; (1) greater organization and understanding of patient data; (2) guiding of assessments and priorities of care; (3) better communication with others, and several subthemes. Thus, the Safe Care Framework™ may be a practical operational tool that can support novice nurses in developing critical thinking skills. This framework adds to the literature on innovative pedagogy for nurse educators. © 2020 The Author

AB  - The motivation for the design of this study was to understand the possibility and impact of the involvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals on school STEM education. This involved two stages, with the design of a set of authentic STEM inquiry activities firstly and implementation in primary classrooms secondly. Five teachers from a local primary school, who were making their first attempt in implementing STEM learning with students at senior primary levels, participated in this study. The teachers worked collaboratively with an Environmental Scientist with support from the research team to design authentic STEM activities to solve a problem which is currently affecting the school environment. The study used a qualitative approach with teachers’ pre- and post- concept maps, self-reflections and interviews to capture changes in teachers’ STEM conceptions. The findings showed that “School-STEM Professionals’ Collaboration” had a positive impact on teachers’ conceptions of STEM education and STEM professionals. © 2020 Australian Teacher Education Association.

AB  - In recent years engineering curricula have had a renewed focus on engineering design. At the University of British Columbia undergraduate students have a general first year and then apply to engineering majors for their second-year of study. In the first-year engineering program, there is a two-course sequence where students are introduced to general engineering design. This is done through a variety of case studies in modules lasting 3 to 4 weeks. The Chemical and Biological Engineering Department through consultations with stakeholders such as students, faculty, alumni and industry saw a need to integrate more engineering design practice into the second and third years of the undergraduate programs it offers. Based on this, the department has introduced a series of two new second-year undergraduate courses introducing engineering science fundamentals and design. These courses integrate some content from courses they replace while also introducing new content, specifically around engineering design. The new second-year courses build on student design experiences from first-year while introducing students to more discipline-specific design processes. The first course in this series focuses on chemical engineering and the second course on biological engineering. This current research focuses on the impact of the first course in this series. Concept maps have been shown to be a powerful and flexible way of assessing student learning. They have been implemented in a wide variety of contexts such as in design and conceptual knowledge assessment. Students were asked to create a concept map for chemical engineering at the start (pre) and end (post) of the course outlining the 10-20 most important concepts in chemical and biological engineering and how they are related. Students completed this exercise using a concept mapping tool (CmapTools). These responses were then analyzed using a thematic analysis. Results from this were used to compare common themes in class responses at the start and end of the course. It was found that students at the end of the course converged on five particular topics which were focus areas in the newly implemented design course, suggesting an effective teaching practice. A shift in themes was seen from scientific topics (eg. organic chemistry, math) to engineering science or design topics (material balances, energy balances, process control, etc), which can be explained by the gain in familiarity with the field. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.

AB  - As the Baby Boomer generation reaches old age, there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults needing healthcare over the past decade. The physiology of aging is therefore a highly relevant topic for the preclinical medical curriculum. I describe a new capstone unit on the physiology of aging, placed at the end a medical physiology course, to provide a vehicle for integration of prior learning about physiology of each individual body system. Students were provided with online selfstudy modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a “Review of Systems” predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components. © 2021 the American Physiological Society.

AB  - This paper presents a digital learning tool, MESTRAL (“Modélisation Et Simulation des TRansformations ALimentaires”, “Modelling and Simulating Food Processing” in English), that can provide educators with a tool to teach food processing using simulators and a broad range of models derived from research in food science & engineering. It was built using electronic knowledge books (eK-book). The eK-book represents knowledge in the form of concept maps and knowledge sheets, connected via a network of hypertext links. MESTRAL encompasses 15 modules, that cover approximately 150 h of teaching and a broad range of real systems, from a single unit operation (e.g., frying a banana) to a logistic chain (e.g., ham cold chain). Each module conveys information on a food product or a food process, and includes a simulator based on a published scientific model. Altogether, the models address various scale of systems and are based on different theoretical frameworks. For each simulator, the model inputs and outputs are stored in a database. Outputs are visualized through abacuses, which can be used for virtual practice. MESTRAL modules also include training exercises and tests to help students to assess the knowledge they have acquired during consultation of the modules. Finally, MESTRAL has already been successfully tested by different audiences according to various learning forms. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - One of the critical aspects of building intelligent tutoring systems regards proper monitoring of student's activity and academic performance. This paper presents a continuous student knowledge tracing method implemented for Tesys e-Learning platform at the Faculty of Automation, Computers and Electronics in the University of Craiova. The student's knowledge level is continuously monitored and, after each recommended test by the SVD-based mechanism, a new set of knowledge weights are computed. We aim to achieve a comprehensive monitoring environment which can provide an accurate insight upon the student's knowledge level at any moment. In our approach, we added weights for both students and tests to improve the student's evolution monitoring and provide more accurate feedback. The setup for validation consisted of ten tests with eight questions per test and we used both current and past year tests data. Results revealed that assigning weights to questions, tests and students and using them in the recommendation process offers a better view of the student's evolution along with more accurate recommendations. Progress in this direction will provide more insight into available teaching materials and SVD-based recommender system such that the e-learning platform that integrates the presented mechanism will provide a better learning experience. © 2021 AECE

AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real-world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi-directional peer-assessment-based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers’ concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers’ ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi-directional peer-assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi-directional peer-assessment-based concept mapping system can not only increase students’ learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment. © 2020 British Educational Research Association

AB  - Objectives: The objective of the study is to estimate the difference in knowledge gain between the students of varied learning approaches during didactic lectures and concept mapping lectures. Materials and Methods: The study participants included 118 second-year medical undergraduate students. The learning approaches of the participants were assessed using the ASSIST questionnaire on a 5-point Likert-type scale. Two lectures in pharmacology subject were taken using the concept mapping technique and two lectures were taken in didactic format with an equal difficulty level. The students’ prior knowledge was assessed using 40 MCQ’s that were given 4 days before the commencement of the lectures with 10 MCQs from each topic. The same questions were given to the students 3 weeks after the completion of the each lecture. Results: The score improvement of the three categories of learners was significantly higher for concept mapping session when compared to the didactic lectures. There was no significant difference in the score improvement between the surface, strategic and deep learners in both didactic and concept mapping sessions. Conclusion: The learning approach did not influence the long-term knowledge retention following didactic and concept mapping sessions. Learners study strategy and the mode of assessment could play a role in determining the knowledge outcome. © 2021, Association of Pharmaceutical Teachers of India. All rights reserved.

AB  - In peer assessment, both receiving feedback and giving feedback (reviewing peers’ products) have been found to be beneficial for learning. However, the different ways to give feedback and their influence on learning have not been studied enough. This experimental study compared giving feedback by writing comments and by grading, to determine which contributes more to the feedback providers’ learning. Secondary school students from Russia (n = 51) and the Netherlands (n = 42) gave feedback on concept maps during a physics lesson. The lesson was given in an online inquiry learning environment that included an online lab. Students gave feedback in a special Peer Assessment tool, which also provided assessment criteria. Findings indicate that post-test knowledge scores were higher for students from the commenting group. The difference between the groups was largest for the low prior knowledge students. Possible educational implications and directions for further research are discussed. © 2020 The Author(s)

AB  - Objective To develop a concept map in order to evaluate the factors associated with continuing of vancomycin after 48 to 72 hours of prescription despite the lack of supporting microbiological data. Methods This study was conducted in a teaching hospital affiliated to Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Iran, between January 2017 and March 2017. After demonstrating the high rate of overuse and inappropriate use of vancomycin in our teaching hospital in the first arm of the study, we attempted to evaluate the factors associated with this behavior by developing a concept map. In this study, cluster approach of concept mapping was used and the importance of statements was scored by using the 5-point Likert method (1 for the lowest score and 5 for the highest score). Results Twenty-one physicians were participated, with a male to female ratio of 2. During the brainstorming session, about 25 statements were generated, which eventually resulted in sorting of 16 appropriate statements. The highest scored statements for continuing vancomycin after 48 to 72 hours of prescription in the absence of supporting microbiological data was worries and concerns of physicians regarding critically ill status of patients (score, 3.76) and lack of updated information on microbiological spectrum and antimicrobial resistance pattern of infections at the regional level (score, 3.57). In the final cluster analysis, the mean of importance of a cluster consisted of "health care system-physician related factors"was scored highest (score, 3.2), as compared with other created clusters. Conclusions According to the result of our study, improving vancomycin use requires more effective education of basic principles of diagnosis of infectious clinical syndromes and the concept of deescalation of antibiotics. It should also address physicians' concerns about the management of critically ill septic patients. In addition, providing the physicians with updated information on microbiological spectrum and antimicrobial resistance pattern of infections at the regional level can be effective in improving vancomycin prescription behavior.  © Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

AB  - Critical thinking is the ability that helps individuals make a logical and structured decision in solving a problem. The implementation of an applied learning model in the classroom can empower students to think critically. This study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of Reading-Concept Mapping-Numbered Heads Together (Remap-NHT) in promoting students' critical thinking skills. A nonequivalent pretest-posttest control group design was employed in this study. The participants consisted of 100 eleven-grade students from the Natural Science Program of SMA Negeri 4 Malang, Indonesia. The data were collected using essay tests that had been tested for reliability and categorized as reliable. Data analysis was performed using one-way ANCOVA. The analysis results showed a significant improvement in the students' critical thinking scores after being taught using Remap NHT. It was apparent that the Remap NHT syntax facilitated the indicators that support the students' critical thinking development. © 2021 Author(s).

AB  - General Data Protection Regulation came into effect across the European Union in May 2018 but its implications in healthcare are yet to be fully understood. The aim of this study was to identify the fronts and hot topics in research on GDPR in healthcare. We analyzed the relevant records in Scopus through bibliometric and scientometric approach and visualization techniques. A set of 155 records was obtained and processed for co-occurrence analysis of key terms and concept mapping. The number of published papers showed a steep rise in the past two years, mainly by European countries. Analysis of the abstract of the papers showed that data protection, privacy, and big data were the most frequently used terms. Three dominant research fronts of GDPR are 1) general implications of GDPR, 2) technology aspects of GDPR, and 3) GDPR in healthcare service. Blockchain and machine learning are among the remerging topics of GDPR research. © 2020 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

AB  - Purpose: The concept of workforce agility has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, defining it has sparked much discussion and ambiguity. Recognizing this ambiguity, this paper aims to inductively develop a behavioral taxonomy of workforce agility. Design/methodology/approach: The authors interviewed 36 experts in the field of agility and used concept mapping and the critical incident technique to create a behavioral taxonomy. Findings: The authors identified a behavioral taxonomy consisting of ten dimensions: (1) accepting changes, (2) decision making, (3) creating transparency, (4) collaboration, (5) reflection, (6) user centricity, (7) iteration, (8) testing, (9) self-organization, and (10) learning. Research limitations/implications: The authors’ research contributes to the literature in that it offers an inductively developed behavioral taxonomy of workforce agility with ten dimensions. It further adds to the literature by tying the notion of workforce agility to the performance literature. Practical implications: The authors’ results suggest that it might be beneficial for companies to take all workforce agility dimensions into account when creating an agile culture, starting agile projects, integrating agility into hiring decisions or evaluating employee performance. Originality/value: This paper uses an inductive approach to define workforce agility as a set of behavioral dimensions, integrating the scientific as well as the practitioner literature on agility. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - There is widespread evidence showing that concept maps are effective for learning. However, little is known about the effects of various concept map activities. We conducted an experiment to examine the comparative effectiveness of three concept map activities: (i) translating a complete map to a paragraph format, (ii) filling in concepts in a partial map, and (iii) filling in labels in a partial map. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general chemistry course were randomly assigned to the three groups. Each concept map depicted the relationships between concepts on the topic of reaction enthalpy. Results showed that the map-translation group significantly outperformed the fill-in-concepts and fill-in-labels groups in conceptual understanding indicated by open-ended questions while there were no significant differences among the three groups in conceptual understanding indicated by multiple-choice questions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: unknown, maybe, probably, definitely, and wow. The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t(41), p >.38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups. © The Author(s) 2020.

AB  - The aim of the research is to measure the increase of valid relationship (VR) concept map (CM) scores using a teacher's question in the stage of solution presentation and reflection problem-based learning. The research is a classroom action consisting of pre-cycle, cycle I, and cycle II. The research procedure included planning, implementing actions, observations, and reflecting on 36 high school X grade students. The research data was VR scores calculated based on expert CM, supported by syntax implementation and performance assessment. Validation of data used triangulation methods which confirmed VR scores with documentation and interviews. The data analysis used data reduction, data presentation, and conclusion. The results showed that the number of students who has an increase in VR scores in linear, trend, and fluctuating fashion as follows: 44,44%; 22,22%; and 33,33%. The teacher's question in the stage of solution presentation and reflection increased VR scores, therefore the teacher can apply the action to train student's ability to connect concepts in class. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - It is difficult to establish the relationship among complex concepts learned in virtual learning activities in the absence of appropriate instructional scaffolds, which may lead to students' confusion and frustration. To address such an issue, a mixed reality (MR) friction experiment system integrated with interactive hierarchical concept maps with the name of MMRCM is proposed as a scaffolding tool to guide students in learning friction concepts. Results of a quasi-experiment assessing the effectiveness of MMRCM showed that students' academic performance improved significantly. Interviews with students and teachers also showed that the MMRCM system could help learners navigate educational concepts and material efficiently. © 2021 IEEE.

AB  - Scaffolds are considered to be a promising method of supporting learning. In this study, we investigated the learning efficacy of scaffolds in an inquiry-based learning scenario. Three tasks posed a question/problem to facilitate inquiry-based learning, and scaffolds offered the answer/solution in multiple steps (so-called incremental scaffolds). The use of the scaffolds was voluntary and students' learning efficacy was compared with a traditional teaching approach. A total of N = 105 seventh graders participated in the quasi-experimental study. Incremental scaffolds were available to the students in the treatment group. Students in the control group received the same question/problem but could only ask the teacher about the answer/solution. Concept maps were used at pre- and posttest to assess conceptual knowledge acquisition. In-line with our hypothesis, results show that students in the treatment group outperformed controls concerning conceptual knowledge acquisition. Regarding the number of misconceptions students used, there were no differences between the groups. Our study indicates that incremental scaffolds are an appropriate method to provide students with the exact help they really need. Based on our findings, we offer practical implications and recommendations for future research. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Concept mapping helps learners to understand complex ideas. However, studies confirming that statement are scarce. A quasi-experimental and Design-based approaches were applied to understand the effectiveness of concept mapping based teaching method on grade eight students´ conceptual lunderstanding of photosynthesis. Two sections of grade eightc onsisting of 103 students were selected randomly.Pretest results were used to assign students as experimental and control groups and treated with concept mapping and lecture methods,respectively. The post-test results of the two study groups revealed astatistically significant difference indicated that students´ treated with concept mapping method exhibited better conceptual understanding on the concept of photosynthesis than those treated with lecture method. This study suggests that science teachers should apply concept mapping method to teach science concepts systematically. The use of concept mapping method in science classes can help students to better understand the important concepts © 2020 by the authors; licensee Modestum.

AB  - Is science value-free? Or is it valuable only for the scientists? Does someone have ethical or moral obligations for the knowledge they have? If education is defined as a process of “teaching” knowledge, what kind of knowledge should be taught? What function does education have in regards to science? Does education have a role in determining the direction and shade of science in the future? By using philosophical critical analysis, this study describes the concept map of ethics in science, the procedure of developing ethical science, and the construction of functions and roles of education in the development of science. Science does not only have pragmatic values, but the process should also follow the applicable ethics. Science, through the actors, must be able to consider the ethical values or aspects of the development of science itself. Scientists, including educators, need not only to share scientific facts and information with the society, but also to explain the use-values, impacts, and expectations carried by science. © 2020 SERSC.

AB  - A firm definition of geography is often elusive and at times, the field is criticized for borrowing heavily from other disciplines. However, this article argues that the real strength of geography is its integrative nature. The purpose of this article is to discuss geography’s integrative nature and how this strength can be integrated into the undergraduate environmental science curriculum. Two brief examples are provided from the author’s own teaching and research experiences. Concept mapping in an introductory environmental science class allows students to visualize the complexity and integrative nature of environmental issues. In the atmospheric science classroom, students are introduced not only to the physical processes of weather hazards, but to the social dimensions as well. It is imperative that future scientists, advocates, and decision makers learn to critically integrate across disciplines to solve the world’s most pressing environmental issues.

AB  - Meaningful learning occurs by relating new information to and revising prior knowledge, making it essential to understand student knowledge before helping them move toward a more scientific understanding. In this study, we characterise prior knowledge about cellular respiration in undergraduate students enrolled in introductory biology by analysing student-constructed concept maps (N = 182) and interviews (N = 9). Students were instructed to create concept maps from a bank of 20 concepts with the purpose of interconnecting the processes of cellular respiration, showing how pools of ATP are generated and used, and identifying where the events of cellular respiration occur. Student maps were analysed for content, quality and organisation of knowledge. Interviews were used to corroborate inferences made from concept maps. Students had a simplified understanding of cellular respiration and its processes as evident by cognitive structures with limited quantities of schemas that were vaguely connected and linearly organised. Furthermore, students had a better understanding of glycolysis than fermentation. Instructors can use these findings to help students build better knowledge of cellular respiration by focusing on incorporating relevant schemas, creating quality connections among schemas, and organising their knowledge of cellular respiration to reflect biological complexity. © 2018, © 2018 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - Immunology is a fascinating and extremely complex field, with natural connections to many disciplines both within STEM and beyond. Teaching an undergraduate course in immunology therefore provides both opportunities and challenges. Significant challenges to student learning include mastering the volume of new vocabulary and figuring out how to think coherently about a physiological system that is so anatomically disseminated. More importantly, teaching immunology can be complicated because it requires students to integrate knowledge derived from prior introductory courses in a range of fields, including cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy and genetics. However, this also provides an opportunity to use the study of the immune system as a platform on which students can assemble and integrate foundational STEM knowledge, while also learning about a new and exciting field. Pedagogical theory has taught us that students learn best by engaging with complicated questions and by thinking metacognitively about how to approach solutions. Building this skill set in today's students, who now hail from a broad demographic and who are accustomed to acquiring their knowledge from a variety of different media, requires a new set of teaching tools. Using perspectives from four different immunology educators, we describe a range of student-centered, active learning approaches that have been field-tested in a number of different immunology classrooms and that are geared to a variety of learning styles. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that active learning approaches to immunology improve comprehension and retention by increasing student engagement in class and their subsequent mastery of complex topics. © Copyright © 2020 Stranford, Owen, Mercer and Pollock.

AB  - Evaluation thinking skills are vital component under the cognitive standard of the 21st-century skills for developing knowledge. Evaluation is related to the cognitive thinking process can be visualized using the concept map. The research objective is to find out the profile of integration evaluation thinking skills with concept map in body immune system material. The research procedures are setting up the indicators based on the integration of evaluation thinking skills aspects with concept map aspects to analyze the body immune system material. The analysis employed in this research was descriptive qualitative study. The material analysis is the content, while the way to deliver the material is the context. The analysis results show that: 1) the highest aspect of the content was located in checking-crosslink aspects, 2) the highest aspect of the context was located in critiquing-crosslink aspects, 3) the lowest aspect both of the content and context was located in checking-examples and critiquing-examples aspects. In conclusion, this result can be used to improve the content and context of biology modules that are integrated with high-level thinking skills, especially the evaluation thinking skills and concept map to achieve effective learning. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - This study aims to describe students' perceptions of the characteristics of assisted learning mapping methods such as concept maps (CM), mind maps (MM), and link maps (LM). The study was conducted with qualitative and quantitative data collection with a sample of 10 students as pre-service physics teachers. Quantitative data becomes a supporting part of the qualitative description. Each student was asked to make a concept map, mind map, and link maps with physics material. Furthermore, students' performance is analyzed in the description form of the differences and effectiveness of the mapping when applied in physics learning. These results indicated that mapping has a positive effect on the development of students' thinking abilities, especially in identifying the right concepts for physics material. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The main objective of pathophysiology teaching is to facilitate the learning of mechanisms of diseases and the understanding of their expressions in patients (symptoms, signs and tests). This objective requires the application of basic biomedical science to explain the abnormalities expressed by the patients. The capacity to integrate this new organization of knowledge is essential to the understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, which explain expressions of specific diseases. Our group has a longstanding experience in the teaching of pathophysiology to medical students using problem-based learning (PBL) and concept mapping (CM). This semestral discipline has a yearly intake of 190 students, divided into 18 tutorial groups and supported by 14 tutors. The students' learning progress is evaluated by their performance during the tutorial sessions and the CM methodology has been introduced as an additional tool to visualize the integration of knowledge and how it is displayed in the different pathophysiological mechanisms. Until now, the evaluation of CM has been qualitative and used as an additional assessment tool by the tutors. The presentation will show how we are changing this approach by training the tutors and developing a scoring methodology, together with a preliminary application of the score to selected maps. © This work is licensed under a Creative Commons License CC BY-NC-ND 4.0

AB  - Novakian concept mapping has been shown to offer great potential in the undergraduate science classroom as a tool to support student learning. However, a number of papers in the research literature have been less than rigorous in their application of concept mapping. This chapter highlights a number of key questions that researchers should ask themselves when embarking upon a concept mapping intervention in order to optimize the application of the tool. Firstly there needs to be clarity about the purpose of an intervention: Is it designed as a research protocol to obtain generalizable results, or is the intervention only of local interest in a unique context? This raises the question of whether the maps are research artifacts (data) or tools to support development. Secondly, we need to be clear about the type of knowledge being mapped. Is the map of agreed upon curricular knowledge for which there may be a correct response (where scoring of maps may have some utility), or is the map of “yet-to-be-known” knowledge (of personal reflections and values) where scoring would be inappropriate? Thirdly, will the initial maps provided by participants provide the data that is being sought, or will students need feedback and supportive dialogue to help increase the map quality? Finally, appreciating the ways in which the mapping relates to the philosophy of the curriculum is crucial. If the curriculum requires deep, cumulative learning as part of a collaborative learning community, then mapping is likely to be helpful. If the intention is only for individuals to memorize content, then mapping has no real part to play. By considering each of these issues before embarking upon a mapping intervention, the value of the research outputs is likely to be enhanced. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) leverages technology and concept mapping to support conceptual understanding, as well as collaborative learning to foster knowledge co-construction. This article investigated the effect of different instructional designs using CSCCM on students' conceptual understanding, and on the type of processes of knowledge co-construction that students engage. Participants (N = 120) were 10th graders enrolled in their physics course, randomly distributed in dyads. They were asked to draw concept maps related to the conservation of energy law, by using CSCCM with different instructional designs (i.e., control, Exp. 1 and Exp. 2). In the control condition, dyads worked collaboratively all the time. In both Exp. 1 and Exp. 2, dyads worked first individually (one week) and then collaboratively (two weeks). However, in Exp. 2, the individual concept map was shared with the peer before collaborating. Conceptual understanding improved significantly for learners in all three experimental conditions, especially in Exp. 2. Statistically significant differences were found in students' knowledge co-construction among the three conditions. Dyads in the control group showed a significantly higher use of quick consensus-building. Dyads in Exp. 1 showed a significantly higher reliance on externalization and elicitation. Dyads in Exp. 2 showed a significantly higher enacting of integration- and conflict-oriented consensus building. Accordingly, an instructional design like Exp. 2 optimizes CSCCM learning outcomes in terms of conceptual understanding and knowledge co-construction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Network science is an emerging area of complexity science that uses mathematical techniques to study complex systems and could represent a new way of quantifying and investigating the internal structure of domain-specific knowledge as approximated by students' concept maps. Students enrolled in introductory psychology constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of a psychology chapter. Concept networks were constructed based on the concept maps generated by students. Network analysis revealed that the structure of concept networks differed across students (i.e., some networks were better connected than others), and network structure significantly predicted quiz scores, such that concept networks with larger average shortest path lengths (a network metric representing the average of the shortest paths between two nodes in a network) were associated with higher quiz scores, after controlling for network size. This paper illustrates how network science techniques can be used to quantify the conceptual structure of a learner's knowledge. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

AB  - The term describing the students' notions of scientific concepts dissimilar from scientifically acceptable by the scientist is still debated. This study explores of how scientific concepts performed by high school students (HSSs), pre-service teachers (PSTs), and in-service teachers (ISTs) simultaneously to make clear between their conception vs. scientists' conception, especially in the ionization energy concept. Therefore, it is crucial to raise the position of scientific conception and misconception. For diagnosing the misconceptions, some methods can be used: Concept maps, interviews, multiple-choice tests (one-tier), multiple-tier tests (two-tier, three-tier, fourtiers), open-ended tests, and others. This study utilized multiple-tier tests with three-tier. Totally, 326 participants from Indonesia, including 118 HSSs, 165 PSTs, and 43 ISTs majoring in chemistry, were invited to complete an online -Ionization Energy Diagnostic-Modification (IEDI∗M) test. The test consisted of 12 three-tier diagnostic items. The study indicated four substantial alternative conceptions were acknowledged: Conservation of energy, half-filled sub-shells or stable fully-filled, octet rule framework, and relation-based reasoning. ISTs performed better than HSSs and PSTs on the understanding of ionization energy. The study has also specified the distribution of ionization energy conceptions of Group 1 and 2, and Period 2 and 3 on the periodic system. By utilizing the IEDI∗M, the percentages of alternative concepts decreased from one-tier to two-tier and from two-tier to three-tier. This study gives some implications for the government, policy-makers, chemistry teachers, preservice teachers, and university faculty members. © 2020 Tche Quimica Group. All rights reserved.

AB  - Disease ecology is a rapidly growing subdiscipline, and mammals and their parasites feature prominently in both historical and more recent research efforts. Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions. © 2019 The Author(s).

AB  - Digital literacy skills of students in Indonesia are still very low. This study aims to examine the effectiveness of Online Laboratory Simulation with Concept Mapping and Problem-Based Learning model in improving students’ digital literacy skills. Specifically, the research objectives have been to explore the significant difference between students who learned through the PBL model, Online Laboratory Simulation with Problem-Based Learning (OLS-PBL) model, and Online Laboratory Simulation with Concept Mapping and Problem-Based Learning (OLS-CMPBL) model. It is a quasi-experimental with pre and post-test design. The population of this research is students at Islamic State School Yogyakarta (MAN), Indonesia. There were 97 students of class XI science at Islamic State School 1 (MAN 1) as participant. The main data analyses used in this study were the paired-sample t-test, comparative-descriptive analysis, and ANOVA mixed design using SPSS 24. The study reveals that (1) The OLS-CMPBL group had a significant difference in the level of digital literacy skills (sig.0000); (2) the OLS-CMPBL was the most effective model to improve the skills with a gain score of.207 (low). Learning with the OLS-CMPBL model can be an alternative for policymakers and teachers to solve the problems of digital literacy. © 2020, Universitas Negeri Yogyakarta (Yogyakarta State University).

AB  - One of the key agendas for the emerging field of disciplinary-based education research is the evaluation of the trajectory of disciplinary knowledge development from novice to expert. However, with the ongoing promotion of student-centered and collaborative undergraduate science classrooms, it is unknown how peer discourse during these exercises might influence (promote or hinder) student construction of expert knowledge. This study documented the knowledge structures of n = 13 undergraduate biology students in a first semester biology course for majors across four instructional units. Participants constructed both individual and group-negotiated concept maps and map complexity, propositional stream similarity, and propositional accuracy were used as measures of quality of knowledge structure. Results indicated that on individually-constructed maps, in general, students had moderate quality knowledge structures when compared to experts. Individual map complexity seemed to increase over time, but stream similarity and propositional accuracy were more dependent on content unit. Group-constructed maps were consistently more accurate than individually-constructed maps. Results are discussed in the context of the use of collaborative concept mapping as a means to develop disciplinary expertise in biology. © 2018, © 2018 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - This study examined the effects of Concept Mapping (CM) and Mind Mapping (MM) on the creativity of the ecology of senior secondary schools' students in Nigeria. The study employed quasi-experimental, which adopted the Pre-test Post-test non-equivalent group design to achieve the research objectives. Three components of creativity (fluency, flexibility and originality) were used to test the level of the creative ability of the students by using the CM and the MM as pedagogy in the classroom. The two groups (CM and MM) were all experimental. A sample of 78 students in two intact classes of two different senior secondary schools in Plateau State, Nigeria, were used for the study. The collection of data was carried out using the Ibadan Creativity Assessment Scale (ICAS) as the instrument, and MANOVA was used for data analysis. The findings show that there is a significant difference between the two experimental groups; that is, there are variations among the students in terms of their creative ability on ecology in favour of the CM group. However, this study will serve as an instructional strategy for teachers in teaching Ecology and improve the creativity of students in Nigeria. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.

AB  - Context: This work is a part of the evaluation of learning for nursing students at the My Youssef hospital center in Casablanca The purpose of this study was to evaluate student learning strategies using the concept map technique for learning the concept of Therapeutic Education of the Diabetic Patient (TEDP) among nursing students.. Method: As part of the training of nursing students, we suggested that they make 2 concept maps based on the concept of TEDP, a map before the clinic internship and a second map after 2 months of internship. The concept maps were analyzed by calculating the complexity index of the first and the second map by counting the number of concepts on the map and the number of links. The Wilcoxon test was used to describe the differences between the first and second cards produced by the students. Results: 40 concept maps made by 40 participants were analyzed with the corresponding comments. The evolution of the concept maps of the 40 participants shows a real appropriation of this concept; the knowledge is enriched and organized progressively. The students produce several links between the concepts, which can make think of deep learning. Conclusion: the concept map is an interesting technique for learning a new concept during a self-training activity because it encourages, simultaneously with its development, a metacognitive reflection. © BEIESP.

AB  - Many children do not meet the recommendations for healthy sleep, which is concerning given the potential negative effects on children’s health. To promote healthy sleep, it is crucial to understand its determinants. This concept mapping study therefore explores perspectives of children and parents on potential determinants of children’s inadequate sleep. The focus lies on 9– 12 year old children (n = 45), and their parents (n = 33), from low socioeconomic neighbourhoods, as these children run a higher risk of living in a sleep-disturbing environment (e.g., worries, noise). All participants generated potential reasons (i.e., ideas) for children’s inadequate sleep. Next, participants sorted all ideas by relatedness and rated their importance. Subsequently, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were performed to create clusters of ideas for children and parents separately. Children and parents both identified psychological (i.e., fear, affective state, stressful situation), social environmental (i.e., sleep schedule, family sleep habits), behavioural (i.e., screen behaviour, physical activity, diet), physical environmental (i.e., sleep environment such as temperature, noise, light), and physiological (i.e., physical well-being) determinants. These insights may be valuable for the development of future healthy sleep interventions. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Students always encounter difficulties in studying biochemical pathways. They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one-by-one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The “AG City” is a self-learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy-to-understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as “railway stations”. Students can easily identify common “railway stations” presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together. This interactive self-learning tool has been packaged as a courseware using the Articulate Storyline eLearning authoring software. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(5):532–537, 2019. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB  - Students of human anatomy face domain-specific and generational challenges in their acquisition of the subject material. Anatomy is detail-heavy and overwhelming, as the larger conceptual framework is built upon interdependent components connected by several types of multidirectional relationships in four domains, all acting simultaneously. Adding to the difficulty of the material are changes in the educational and social environment, including “teaching to the test” and extensive cell phone usage among students, which has been found to correlate positively with inattention. Proper scaffolding of student development of higher-level cognitive processes has the potential to create positive learner outcomes in tomorrow’s medical workforce. Based on over 100 hours of expert interviews, our new ITS for teaching human anatomy and physiology uses a hierarchical concept map with unlockable content, shows multiple types of relationships, and is color-coded by domain to help students master the complex material. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Background and aim Understanding the barriers to programme use is important to facilitate implementation of injury prevention programmes in real-word settings. This study investigated the barriers to coaches of adolescent female soccer teams, in Victoria, Australia, implementing the evidence-based FIFA 11+ injury prevention programme. Methods Concept mapping with data collected from 19 soccer coaches and administrators. Results Brainstorming generated 65 statements as barriers to 11+ implementation. After the statements were synthesised and edited, participants sorted 59 statements into groups (mean, 6.2 groups; range, 3-10 groups). Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis identified a six-cluster solution: Lack of 11+ knowledge among coaches (15 statements), Lack of player enjoyment and engagement (14), Lack of link to football-related goals (11), Lack of facilities and resources (8), Lack of leadership (6) and Lack of time at training (5). Statements in the 'Lack of 11+ knowledge among coaches' cluster received the highest mean importance (3.67 out of 5) and feasibility for the Football Federation to address (3.20) rating. Statements in the 'Lack of facilities and resources' cluster received the lowest mean importance rating (2.23), while statements in the 'Lack of time at training' cluster received the lowest mean feasibility rating (2.19). Conclusions A multistrategy, ecological approach to implementing the 11+ - with specific attention paid to improving coach knowledge about the 11+ and how to implement it, linking the 11+ to the primary goal of soccer training, and organisational leadership - is required to improve the uptake of the 11+ among the targeted coaches. © Article author(s) (or their employer(s) unless otherwise stated in the text of the article) 2019.

AB  - The article analyzes the contributions of a didactic sequence regarding water in promoting scientific literacy in the early years. A pedagogical intervention research was developed with 24 students from Elemetary public school in Araucária/PR, during the second semester of 2016, involving the implementation of a didactic sequence based on the three pedagogical moments and the elaboration of conceptual maps. A semi-structured interview was conducted with the students, using the concept maps built as a base, so that they could explain the knowledge acquired during the didactic sequence, supporting the analysis of the presence of indicators of scientific literacy. The results showed that the implementation of the didactic sequence materialized the necessary skills to be scientifically literate, showing that the school has the important role of enabling access to scientific knowledge, being fundamental that it provide a formative process from an early age, aiming to form critical and conscious citizens. who understand scientific language and know how to use it more actively in society. We found that the didactic sequence developed skills necessary for the promotion of scientific literacy in that it provided students with the experience of situations in which they had to position themselves, putting in check their previous conceptions about the studied themes, demonstrate the appropriation of several concepts. evidencing the construction of knowledge. In order for the student to become a critical citizen, aware of society and take a stand on processes and innovations that affect him/her daily, new actions and didactic resources are needed to help increase scientific literacy. © 2020

AB  - Abstract Background: Clinical experiences are an essential foundation of nursing education. While there have been many significant investigations into models of clinical education and student learning, how students ‘make sense’ of their experiences is less well investigated. Senior nursing staff in a tertiary health service partnered with nurse researchers to explore how students can learn more about practice through structured discussions with peers to promote shared understandings. Objectives: The study aimed to evaluate the contributions to student learning from structured peer discussions about patient care. Design: Exploratory observational study of the effects of learning circle discussions on individual understanding of patient care. Setting: A metropolitan health service in southeast Queensland, Australia. Participants: 72 Bachelor of Nursing students in Years 2 and 3. Methods: Students developed concept maps about patient care prior to peer discussions, and subsequently added further concepts (in another colour of text) after those discussions. Researchers' review of student generated concept maps and coded concepts indicated a five a priori ways of knowing categories: empirical, aesthetic, ethical, personal and socio-political. Descriptive analysis of categories was then conducted. Results: Empirical knowing was high in both groups, with more concepts included in Year 3 student maps. Aesthetic knowing was relatively high in both groups. Socio-political knowing was lower than anticipated overall. Personal and ethical forms of knowing were rarely included on the concept maps. Conclusions: While clinical placement is valued for developing empirical and aesthetic forms of knowing, the other forms of knowing have value for patient and family care and warrant strategies to improve their further development. Developing strategies to support student learning of ethical and personal forms of knowing deserves further investigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Research has shown that primary school teachers often have a poor background in science and scientific concepts, and as a consequence may feel particularly under-prepared to teach science. This study examines the effect of an intervention that investigated the knowledge and understanding of science concepts for a group of 8 first-year preservice primary teachers. The intervention consisted of engaging the participants using two technology-based resources: Omosa, a 3D game-like virtual learning environment (VLE), and Omosa NetLogo, a simulation/modelling environment. A small-N study design was used in this study to determine whether or not the intervention resulted in improving preservice teachers’ science content knowledge. Data sources included semi-structured interviews and concept maps. Overall, the findings suggest that the combination of the immersive and modelling environments facilitated and provided appropriate knowledge-building opportunities for participants by supporting their cognitive engagement. © 2019, Beijing Normal University.

AB  - This study aims to explain teacher content knowledge in generalizing mind maps of quadrilateral. This research use descriptive qualitative approach. The research subjects were 26 mathematics teachers (9 men and 17 women) who had taught at least 5 years and fulfilled the requirements for the teacher certification program. Knowledge of teacher content in generalizing quadrilateral concept maps was analyzed using De Villiers's framework on three types of definitions in geometry. The results showed that there were three types of knowledge of teacher content in defining rectangle, namely (1) fulfill the necessary requirements and sufficient conditions for minimal definition, (2) fulfill the necessary and sufficient condition but excessive requirements, and (3) not meet the necessary requirements and sufficient conditions. The mistakes shown by teachers are: Incorrectly stating the nature or attributes; does not state sufficient conditions of definition; necessary conditions and sufficient conditions are excessive. The results show that there are two types of teachers content knowledge in generalizing hierarchically and partially mind maps. © 2018 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

MESA Press, Chicago, 1982), and this paper extends these ideas with a specific focus on Rasch measurement theory. Rasch’s measurement work reflects a key milestone in a paradigmatic shift from classical test theory to item response theory (van der Linden WJ, Handbook of item response theory, volume 1: models. CRC Press, Boca Raton, 2016). We include a categorization of measurement models that are commonly viewed as Rasch models (dichotomous, rating scale, partial credit, and many-faceted), as well as extensions of these models (mixed, multilevel, multidimensional, and explanatory models). Georg Rasch proposed a set of principles related to objectivity and invariance that reflect foundational concepts underlying science. Rasch measurement theory is the application of these foundational concepts to measurement. Concept maps provide useful didactic tools for understanding progress in measurement theory in the human sciences, and also for appreciating Rasch’s contributions to current theory and practice in psychometrics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - Decision-making in complex environments requires a detailed understanding of causality to avoid unintended consequences and consider multiple scenarios. Concept mapping is of the key tools to support such decision-making activities. A system is abstracted as a ‘map’ or graph, in which relevant factors are represented as nodes and connected through causal links. Although studies have shown that concept maps help students recall the evidence and apply the knowledge gained to new cases, barriers such as the difficulty of assessment have prevented a wide adoption of concept maps by instructors. Previous works have partly addressed this concern by using graph algorithms to automatically assess or score a student’s map, but instructors are often more interested in correcting their students’ misconceptions than in only counting mistakes. In this paper, we design and implement a system to automatically guide students in modifying their conceptual models such that they get increasingly similar to the models produced by experts on the same problem. Although a simple automatic feedback may tell students to add/remove concepts or links based on whether they appear in the expert’s map, our approach combines expertise from systems science and participatory modeling to help students better understand why low-level changes are motivated by higher-level structures such as loops and alternative paths. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - In an effort to improve student conceptual understanding and help students better connect pre-existing knowledge to new ideas, a concept map assignment was implemented in a first-year college level general chemistry course. This implementation included a quasi-experiment that was carried out in discussion group recitation sections within a third-quarter general chemistry course. Students enrolled in a single section of the course were divided into two groups in which a concept map treatment was compared to a control group that completed short journal entries. Comparison of a concept inventory post-test using an independent samples t-test indicates students in the concept map treatment appear to perform better than the students in the journal control group (t = 2.34, mean difference = 0.844, p < 0.05). However, a multi-variable regression analysis in which the concept inventory post-test scores were compared between the treatment and control groups, while traits related to incoming academic preparation were held constant, suggests there was no significant difference in performance (unstandardized b = 0.222, p = 0.540). The quality of the students' concept maps was also evaluated and correlated to student performance on the concept inventory, and it appears students who were better at concept mapping made greater gains in conceptual understanding (Pearson's r = 0.295, p < 0.05). When the relationship between the quality of concept mapping and concept inventory post-test was determined while holding constant covariates related to incoming academic preparation, the unstandardized B coefficient was positive, but was not significant at the p = 0.05 level (unstandardized b = 0.215, p = 0.134) This study does not provide unequivocal evidence that a concept map treatment leads to greater gains in conceptual understanding compared to a control population, or that students with better concept mapping skills performed better on the concept inventory instrument. Nevertheless, a template for implementing a concept map assignment in a large enrollment course is provided, and the results presented herein might prompt chemistry instructors to consider including concept map assignments in their instructional toolbox. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - For learners to be successful in an information problem solving task, they should be able to effectively regulate their own behaviour. Despite views that such behaviour may come naturally to an individual, research generally shows that some learners do experience problems with information problem solving that may stem from such things as limited prior knowledge. As a means of addressing this challenge, the authors explored how the provision of both a concept map and search tool could overcome barriers to effective information problem solving. This was explored in the current study using data collected from 111 undergraduate students who completed an information problem solving activity, wherein a concept map and search tool were provided to help them write two short essays. Through the use of event-sequence analysis and hierarchical clustering, two information problem solving strategy groups were identified (High Engagement and Low Engagement), which differed across time-on-task and essay grades. Additional analyses were undertaken to explore self-reported prior knowledge or motivation as predictors of group assignment. The findings show that even when presented with opportunities (i.e., concept map) to support effective information problem solving, not all learners will take advantage or glean the benefits of such tools. Trace data methodology is shown to be a promising approach to explore information problem solving behaviour that can overcome the limitations of solely relying upon self-report measures. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Introduction: Ever-expanding medical literature demands successful amalgamation of huge information and clinical practice for budding doctors. This study aimed to find the effectiveness of the concept map, a novel method of teaching to improve performance among undergraduate pharmacology students. Methods: The undergraduate medical students pursuing pharmacology in 2017-18 in our institute was divided into two groups after stratified randomization based on the last semester grades. After a session of didactic lecture on ‘Drugs affecting Calcium Metabolism’ and a pre-test, one group was taught using traditional tutorial methods and another group using the concept map method. Finally, a post-test was taken and feedback received from the intervention group. Results: A significant improvement of student performance was found in both groups using validated questionnaire from pre-test to post-test. There was no significant difference in the percentage of improvement between the groups. This finding was consistent in both Low scorers and High scorers of the previous semester examination. Students found the new method better in terms of understanding the concept and interactivity. Conclusion: Concept mapping encourages the students to actively participate and get a comprehensive and accurate overview of the topic, but the improvement in performance in the test was not evident. © 2019, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times. It is a central aspect of social development, but it is hardly discussed in schools and often neglected in the natural sciences. In order to promote creativity in science teaching in a targeted way, it is important to understand the perspectives and views of prospective teachers on this topic. For this purpose, a qualitative cross-sectional study was conducted with 83 German chemistry student teachers at the beginning and at the end of their study programme. We used concept maps and questionnaires to characterize changes in students' perspective on creativity in the chemistry classroom during their course of study. The quantitative analysis of the concept maps and the content analysis of student's proposition revealed similarities and differences in students' perspective on creativity between beginners and advanced student. All student teachers showed a diverse range of conceptions and views on creativity in general and in the context of chemistry education. Furthermore, almost all of the students had a positive attitude towards creativity and its integration in chemistry lessons. Although, there are no large differences in the perspective on creativity from beginner to advanced student teachers, subtle differences in students' perspectives revealed that advanced students had a more sophisticated perspective on fostering creativity in students in their prospective classrooms. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the elements of psychotherapists’ informal education and features of concept maps reflecting the properties of thinking structure. Design/methodology/approach: To study the structure of professional thinking, a complex diagnostic task (computer-aided conceptual mapping task) was used. The diagnostic task consisted of categorising the client’s statements, presenting relations between the categories and concept maps accounting for problems reported by the client and contributing factors and links between them. Findings: The obtained results showed that self-education, through participation in scientific conferences and attending training courses, was significantly associated with the number of perceived causal relationships between categories and the number of perceived reciprocal links between conceptual categories. Originality/value: This research show factors which may contribute to more reliable case conceptualisation in psychotherapy. The method used to measure integrative complexity was original. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - Objectives: To engage physiotherapists experienced in female elite sport and athletes to co-create a sport-specific anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury risk reduction program. Design: Concept Mapping. Methods: The Concept Systems Global MAX™ web platform was used to collect and analyse data from 27 context and content experts (22 physiotherapists, 5 athletes). Participants brainstormed statements representing the critical elements that should be included in an ACL injury risk reduction program for women playing elite Australian Football (AF). Results: Twenty-two participants brainstormed 56 statements that were synthesised and edited to 62 statements. Statements were sorted into clusters by twenty-three participants and rated on importance and feasibility using six-point scales. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis identified a 5-cluster solution as follows: Football-specific preparation (15 statements); Movement skills (17 statements); Strength and conditioning (15 statements); Individual preparation (7 statements); and Education (8 statements). Calculation of mean ratings for each cluster and statement identified the Movement skills cluster as most important (mean = 3.61 out of 5) and the Football-specific preparation cluster as most feasible (3.75 out of 5). By contrast, the Individual preparation cluster was rated the least important (mean = 2.9 out of 5), and the least feasible (3.12 out of 5), to include in the program. Conclusions: The five clusters of critical elements to include in an ACL injury risk reduction program for women playing elite AF, in order of most to least importance were: movement skills, football-specific preparation, education, strength and conditioning and individual preparation. © 2019 Sports Medicine Australia

AB  - Chemical education for health profession curricula has the rigorous task of balancing chemical concepts in relation to healthcare and concepts presented on health profession graduate school admissions and/or licensing exams (such as NCLEX, nursing licensure; and MCAT, medical school admissions), often within a limited time frame. In an attempt to achieve this measure, an engaging learning activity was designed to help nursing (and a number of exercise sciences) students identify chemical education topics in published medical case studies. Student perception of the significance and practicality of this activity was examined. Three groups of students (Ntotal = 167) were provided with a number of published medical case studies and instructed to employ concept mapping techniques to "map out" how examples of four chemical education topics (analytical, biological, general, and organic) were identified in these clinical cases. The overall goal of this project is to allow students to (1) identify, (2) categorize and conceptualize, and (3) apply chemical knowledge in their present studies and overall future healthcare professions. As a result, a marked decline in course fail/pass ratios was observed. Additionally, over 80% of the students who completed the concept map activity voluntary survey highlighted their ability to identify chemistry in healthcare settings after completing the assignment. Student polling also highlighted recommendations for chemistry education in undergraduate health profession curricula, following this activity. Copyright © 2019 American Chemical Society

METHODS: The quasi-experimental case-control study was conducted from April 2015 to October 2016 at the University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran, and comprised students of Fatemeh-Zahra School of Nursing and Midwifery, Shiraz. The students were randomly assigned to intervention and control groups. Baseline data was collected using a two-part questionnaire, including demographic items and California Critical Thinking Skills Test. Both groups underwent 24 six-hour training sessions 3 times a week. The intervention and control groups were trained by conceptual map and integration methods, respectively. Post-intervention data was collected using the same questionnaire and was analysed using SPSS 13. RESULTS: Of the 81 subjects, 41(50.6%) were in the intervention group and 40(49.4%) in the control group. The mean age was 25.12}3.71 years in the intervention group and 25.5}4.10 years in the control group (p>0.05). At baseline, there was no significant difference between the mean critical thinking scores of the two groups (p=0.781). Postintervention values increased in both groups, but the mean critical score was significantly higher in the intervention group (p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Concept mapping was found to be an effective approach for improving students' critical thinking skills.

AB  - The aim of present research was to examine the effects of interdisciplinary teaching approach on teaching the topic of proteins. In the research, unequal control group model-one of the quasi-experimental research designs was used. The experimental group included 16 students (8 female and 8 male) whereas the control group included 14 students (6 female and 8 male) in this research-which was conducted with the participation of the 12th grade students. A lesson plan in which the topic of proteins was taught in interdisciplinary approach was prepared as the tool of application. A concept map prepared by the researcher and a 5-point Likert type of question were used in collected the data. The data collection tool was given to both the experimental group and the control group as a pre-test and post-test. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a non-parametric methodwas used in comparing the participants’ scores in the pre-test and post-test of concept map and Likert type question. As a result, it was found that the application of interdisciplinary teaching conducted in the experimental group had caused differences in students’ associating the concepts in biology and chemistry available in the topic of proteins and in their perceptions of their skills in this respect. © 2020, Scientia Socialis Ltd.

AB  - In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles of non-relativistic theory. The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of undergraduate textbooks, and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties. The answer consists of seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed to account for the results of measurement and time evolution. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets of the interplay between the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables, and to highlight the educational significance of the relations between observables. The maps can be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure and by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While this framework may be adapted to different approaches and interpretive stances, it provides indications in favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one. © 2020 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - This study introduces issue concept maps (IC map) as an instructional tool for exploring students' idea about socio-scientific issues (SSI). By visualizing students' ideas in two dimensions, context and occurrence, IC maps represent what kinds of ideas students have on the issues, and how their ideas change and connect. In the study, we implemented a SSI program on fine dust for 77 seventh graders and used IC maps to investigate how their ideas changed after the program. Students collaboratively constructed IC maps in groups before and after the program. Results show that the number of ideas written on IC maps significantly increased after the program from 92 to 254 ideas, indicating that the program contributed to enhancing students' awareness about the issues in terms of its causes, effects, and countermeasures at various context levels. Students also presented a greater variety of types of connections among their ideas after the program.  © KIM, MUN AND LEE, 2020.

AB  - A well-designed instructional module ensures that the subject matter content is effectively integrated with the presentation format. In other words, the instructor attempts to blend the presentation and content in theory as well as practice. In reality, the instructor should assume the role of a facilitator and effectively utilize modern technology to experiment on innovative ideas. The ultimate objective is a delivery mechanism that can lead to new classroom instructional strategies. Researchers are also of the opinion that education in a new learning paradigm will better prepare students for the work ahead of them. Whether it be performance arts like theatre and music, or be it a laboratory setting like physics or biology, student performance can be effectively accentuated by adopting creative instructional lesson plans. Furthermore, many of our educational institutions have tried to move away from emphasizing the establishment of a strong knowledge-base. In this paper the author discusses two models that he has successfully utilized for accentuating student performance. The first is identified as Concept Mapping Model and the second in identified as Structured Content Model. These two models are of particular interest to Ocean Engineering Courses because certain topics and subject matter can be better presented to the students by selective choice of one of these two models. In certain Ocean Engineering foundation courses it is very important to stress and cover the fundamental concepts and one has to utilize Structured Content Model. In upper level courses, however the students may benefit with the use of Concept Mapping Model because strong foundation and important concepts have already been established in lower level, elementary and basic courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2019

AB  - Concept maps are used in teaching to aid the learning process. Use of concept mapping for other purposes such as communicating course contents is not always successful for STEM courses due to complexity of subjects taught. This paper proposes a new type of maps, the course teaching map (CTM). To create a course teaching map, course elements as well as relationships between them must be represented on the map. The position of elements relative to each other is also significant. The resulting map is easy to read and convey a great deal of information, such as course learning outcomes, pre-requisite knowledge and more importantly teaching stages leading to achievement of course learning outcomes. This information and other can be easily extracted from the map even if one has little knowledge about subject. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - E-Learning has emerged as an important research area. Concept maps creation for emerging new domains such as e-Learning is even more challenging due to its ongoing development nature. For creating Concept map, concepts are extracted. Concepts are domain dependent but big data can have data from different domains. Data in different domain has different semantics. So before applying any analytics to such big unstructured data, we have to categorize the important concepts domain wise semantically before applying any machine learning algorithm. In this paper, we have used a novel approach to automatically cluster the E-Learning concept semantically; we have shown the cluster in table format. Initially, we have extracted important concepts from unstructured data followed by generation of vector space of each concept. Then we used different similarity formula to calculate fuzzy membership values of elements of vector to its corresponding concepts. Semantic Similarity is calculated between two concepts by considering repeatedly the semantic similarity or information gain between two elements of each vector. Then Semantic similarity between two concepts is calculated. Thus concept map can be generated for a particular domain. We have taken research articles as our dataset from different domains like computer science and medical domain containing articles on Cancer. A graph is generated to show that fuzzy relationship between them for all domain. Then clustering them in based on their distances. © BEIESP.

AB  - Low high-level thinking skills (HOTS) of students, especially in physics can not be separated from the process of learning activities of students in schools that have not emphasized the student-centered. One problem is the books or reading material that is used by high school physics students and teachers have not led to the aspects of cognitive domains that are part of high-level thinking skills. Based on those developed for high school physics textbook using concept maps in both the material and the exposure to examples and exercises for students. The study aims to gain if the book is worth to be used in schools. Development model used in this study is a model of Plomp. ModelPlomp consists of three stages of development that preliminary research (initial investigation), prototyping phase (phase prototypes) and assessment phase (phase assessment). To assess the feasibility of this book used some experts consisting of several professors of physics and school physics teacher. The results of the feasibility test of power obtained an average score of 3.65 with very good category. Feasibility in terms of the depth of material, kesesuai with the development of the students thought patterns and linkage map concept with high-level thinking skills.

AB  - While summary writing has been acknowledged by many scholars as an integral skill that builds the background knowledge of learners, and enhances writing outcomes, only a handful of theory-based online summary writing tools have been developed to date. In view of this, the Summary Writing-PAL (SW-PAL) was developed, rooted in several learning and education theories, in the attempt to assist ESL non-English majors in improving their summary writing skills. This study presents both the development and the evaluation of SW-PAL. The three primary features of SW-PAL are prior knowledge activation, summarising strategies instruction, and scaffolding. Prior knowledge activation applies a concept mapping tool as an advance organiser that activates the students’ prior knowledge while comprehending the text. The worked examples tool is meant to aid students in acquiring the essential summarising strategies. The self-generated feedback provided by the tool serves as a scaffolding tool to assist students through the summarising process. Pre- and post-tests, as well as an interview session held with students, ascertained the effectiveness of the tool and perceptions of its users. The study outcomes revealed that the developed SW-PAL had managed to improve their summary-writing ability at a significant level. © 2019 International Conference on Computers in Education, Proceedings.All right reserved.

AB  - During instruction of electronic circuits engineering courses, which consists of 'Fundamentals of Electronic Circuits,' 'Fundamentals of Analog Circuits' and 'Communication Circuits', students are generally found to have misconceptions-misunderstanding and cognition biases by the authors. By designing concept maps and lists for circuit courses, the authors discuss the causes of misconceptions and attempts to diagnose them in teaching and learning. Most of the misconceptions are found to come from inadequate understanding and misuse of the core concepts of the circuit. The authors use the concept maps to find out the core concepts of the course, and asks students to draw the concept maps themselves to explore the correct method to understand circuit models, thus encourage students to actively and consciously find the misconception in the circuit course learning and finally reach the purpose that students have a deep understanding and grasp of the circuit course related content. The results show that the adoption of this strategy in the circuit course teaching has a significant impact on the improvement on students' performance. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal–by using the concept mapping tool–the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students’ concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - The use of technology in the classroom has been a regular practice in the 21st century learning as compared to the traditional teaching and learning. However, the technology has been identified as a separate set of knowledge by most of the instructors in their pedagogical practice which is causing problems in effective teaching and learning. This article describes the process of using the conceptual framework of Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge (TPACK) which integrates the knowledge of educational with an instructor’s knowledge of pedagogy and course content, to technologically enhance a sophomore-level undergraduate electrical machines course. Concept map tool has been used to integrate and demonstrate the effective utilization of TPACK in the classroom teaching. The effective teaching learning process for the Electrical Machines course has been observed in this paper by designing a course website. The information in the paper will impact the effective integration of technology in teaching and learning process. © 2020, Rajarambapu Institute Of Technology. All rights reserved.

AB  - Education research offers strong evidence that social supports, learning interventions situated in meaningful social interaction, during learning can aid in developing interest and promote understanding for the content. However, children are often asked to complete homework tasks in isolation. To address this discrepancy, we build on prior work in social robotics to demonstrate the effectiveness of a socially adept robot, as compared to a socially neutral robot to generate situational interest and improve learning while reading a science textbook. We conducted a randomized controlled experiment (N = 63) of one reading interaction with either the socially adept or socially neutral robot. Our results show that children who read with a socially adept robot found the robot to be friendlier and more attractive, reported a higher level of closeness and mutualliking for the robot, had higher situational interest, and made more scientifically accurate statements on a concept-map activity. We discuss the practical and theoretical implications of these findings. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

AB  - The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. On the one hand, the investigation of such abilities is the purview of psychology; on the other hand, subject-specific educational research is also of interest, as a number of research works in the field of science education show. For computer science education, no corresponding studies are currently available. However, investigating how learners build categories from a choice of given terms may be useful for several reasons; for example, learners’ perspectives on relations between terms, as well as potential misconceptions, can be detected and made available to educators aiming to improve lesson planning. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study with 490 German students from primary to higher education, in which we presented them with 23 information technology-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) on a questionnaire, with the task of assigning these to self-defined categories (and then giving their categories individual names). In the results, we identified a number of potential categorization strategies the participants might have used to categorize the given terms; these include generalization, purpose, place of use, state, part-whole relationships, and association. Recognizing and defining such categorization strategies can help teachers construct learner-adequate concept maps of the domain, which helps foster the elaboration of learners’ knowledge structures in this field. We found that the younger participants used less abstract names for their categories, and observed that some participants had difficulty categorizing some terms (such as robot and 3D). © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today’s schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants’ correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed. © Hammill Institute on Disabilities 2019.

AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Remap RT (Reading – Concept Mapping – Reciprocal Teaching) learning model on low-ability students’ achievement in biology. This quasi-experimen-tal research made use of a pre-test-post-test non-equivalent control group design. The population of this research was 125 tenth-grade students from the Natural Science classes aged around 16 years old. Four classes were randomly selected as the samples, and they were divided into two groups: two classes belonged to the high ability classes, and the other two were categorised into the low ability groups. The students’ achievement was measured using an essay test. The results of the test were analysed using ANCOVA. The findings indicated that 1) students who learned using Remap RT had better academic achievement in biology than students who learned using a conventional method; 2) students with high academic ability had better academic achievement than students with low academic achievement; and 3) low-ability students who learned using Remap RT and high-ability students who learned using a conventional method had equal academic achievement. The results of the research suggest that Remap RT was effective in improving low-ability students’ achievement in biology. © 2020, University of Ljubljana. All rights reserved.

AB  - We are a year into the development of a software tool for modeling and simulation (M&S) of 1D and 2D kinematics consistent with Newton’s laws of motion. Our goal has been to introduce modeling and computational thinking into learning high-school physics. There are two main contributions from an M&S perspective: (1) the use of conceptual modeling, and (2) the application of Finite State Machines (FSMs) to model physical behavior. Both of these techniques have been used by the M&S community to model high-level “soft systems” and discrete events. However, they have not been used to teach physics and represent ways in which M&S can improve physics education. We introduce the NSF-sponsored STEPP project along with its hypothesis and goals. We also describe the development of the three STEPP modules, the server architecture, the assessment plan, and the expected outcomes. © 2019 Association of Computing Machinery.

AB  - “Didn't understand or not fully understand” is the most common situation that students experience when they learn medical biochemistry and molecular biology (MBMB). Therefore, the primary task of teaching MBMB is to help students overcome the difficulties in “conceptual understanding.” The core of the solution to these problems lies in the acquisition and application of cognitive skills. The key to applying Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory (A's CAT) is to expand the knowledge capacity of students’ cognitive structure through the purposeful “production” and employment of advanced organizers, with which students can replace “rote learning” with “meaningful learning” and ultimately develop an interest in MBMB courses. The results showed that the application of A's CAT did not only encourage the students to use cognitive skills to learn and understand MBMB knowledge and overcome the barrier to learning that results from the characteristics of the MBMB course, but also expanded and deepened the MBMB course contents. As a branch of learning theory, A's CAT provides practical methods for the several hypotheses of learning theory. Among these, the advanced organizer strategy realizes the organization and reorganization of new knowledge; the progressive differentiation strategy reduces the difficulty of complex and abstract knowledge; the implementation of the advanced organizer strategy and integrative reconciliation strategy forms the concept map. Taken together, the application of A's CAT includes cognitive strategy and metacognitive strategy when the cognitive process is conducted in a meaningful way. More importantly, application of A's CAT guides students to participate in active learning and builds “scaffolding” for the teaching/learning MBMB of student-centered goals. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB  - Nowaday students don’t want to study in the way their parents did. The problem could be solved by changing the teaching methods, by creating a constructivist learning environment. This paper proposes an interdisciplinary study of the fluids in our lives through conceptual maps, by combining the fields of instruction and technology. The concept map, made on three levels, introduces a presentation in Microsoft Office Power Point 365 with some hyperlinks to 3D educational animations on the Mozabook digital interactive lesson creation platform through which the teacher can show his creativity in teaching. Level 2 concept map is an exposition of fluids in science. The level 3 concept map presents some applications of fluid dynamics in biophysics, more specifically in blood circulation, namely: the first application involved calculating the speed of blood flow through the aorta, the second application estimated the value of Reynolds number for blood flow through the aorta, through the third application the value of the blood speed in the capillaries was obtained and the last one refers to the pressure exerted by the blood on the walls of the blood vessels, being able to explain the phenomenon of regulating blood flow through fluid dynamics laws. © Bucharest University Press.

AB  - The goal of environmental education is not protecting the natural environment or coping with environmental problems through simple solutions. It addresses people and social groups of all ages and aims at developing free and responsible citizens who participate effectively in social acts. It tries to convey meanings which seem to be elusive or ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations. In this way, societies will be able to act collectively in order to discover, probe and set their priorities. It is considered to be a progressive type of education, which is not stable in time. Actually, it discerns and assimilates all the social, financial, technological and cultural changes. In this particular paper, innovative teaching approaches concerning water and more particularly its saving are presented. In the past few decades, the creation of a new mentality on saving water and on proper use of water resources appears to be an imperative need. This effort aims mainly at addressing the constantly increasing needs of modern society as well as ensuring the preservation of all types of ecosystems locally or globally. The subjects of the survey were students at the department of chemistry of Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. The data was processed with the SPSS 21.0 programme and techniques of descriptive statistical analysis were used. The conclusions of the present paper revealed that the implementation of alternative methods of approaching knowledge as well as the analytical description of the whole teaching approach based on lesson plans, concept maps, brainstorming and projects contribute to viable water resources to a great extent. Moreover, they facilitate in altering the mentality on how to consume water (proper use), how to economize on water (waste elimination, reduced consumption, improvement works) through suitable techniques and how to perceive that water is an invaluable commodity (information, education, sensitization). © 2020 School of Science, IHU.

AB  - Concept maps can be used in undergraduate biology as ways to visually communicate the relationships among things and events. One strength of concept mapping is that there is not just a single, correct way to compose one, given a list of particular concepts. Nevertheless there seem to be associations among ideas that are expressed frequently while teaching biology. For example, hierarchical relationships among structures and steps within processes are two common kinds of relationships that students encounter regularly. Based on our own classroom experiences and surveys of concepts appearing in two popular textbooks, we provide here a resource for composing propositions within biological concept maps. This list of more than 50 linking words and phrases is appropriate for freshman biology but can be adapted for use in more advanced courses. © 2019, Association of College and Univesity Biology Educators.

AB  - The aim of this research is to ask what kind of geography is taught in Finnish upper secondary schools and whether this knowledge is powerful knowledge. This is achieved by analysing 11 in-service geography teachers’ concept maps and in-depth interviews with qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the dominance of three terms: spatiality, phenomena and a holistic approach running through the teachers’ conceptions of geographical knowledge, skills and assessment. Geography is described by the teachers as a science which studies extensive spatial phenomena with the help of concepts and a holistic approach and in which values and students’ own lived experiences play a major role. We conclude that the in-service Finnish upper secondary teachers’ perceptions of geography are a form of powerful knowledge because they: (1) urge students to form new geographical thinking about the world, (2) give possibilities for students to study geographical phenomena and (3) evaluate their own knowledge, (4) encourage students to follow topical debates in different scales, (5) open up the students’ world views and (6) support the general objectives of Finnish upper secondary schools by applying four of the six cross-curricular themes to a great extent in teaching geography, particularly sustainable development. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A popular and intuitive way to capture the quality of life in cities is by evaluating ‘livability.’ This study aims to gain insight on the types, importance, and availability of skills needed to develop livable cities, as perceived by researchers and practitioners. Participants in a separate concept mapping project were asked to provide a list of the skills they found most important to the development of livable cities. Responses were synthesized into broader categories. Survey respondents most referenced Collaboration, Communication, and Community Engagement. In a second phase, respondents were asked to select those that they felt were most important. Collaboration and Community Engagement were the two most frequently selected skills in the second phase. Results were compared against competency requirements for program accreditation in the fields of Public Health, Urban Planning, Architecture, Landscape Architecture, and Parks and Recreation Administration. All are vital partners in livable city development. Further trends, similarities, and differences are discussed. This study underscores the enduring need for ‘soft skills,’ non-traditional approaches to education and workforce development, and the increasing relevance of team science. Understanding the skills needed for livable city development helps ensure researchers and practitioners are equipped to participate. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In the present paper, we focus on conceptual mapping. This is a method that performs product analysis of the verbal activity of student. It serves as a graphical representation of the content structure. The concept map expresses a hierarchical arrangement of terms as well as relationships and links between them. Our work aimed to create a model of a conceptual map that should have function as a scientific conceptual map. It contains all the energy concepts that pupils should involve in their knowledge structure. Based on content analysis of textbooks used in elementary schools, we have included concepts not only of physics but also of various disciplines. The second aim was to find out the correspondence between the model scientific conceptual map and the map created in the mind of students. The results reflect valuable information for the teacher-whether the students have in their minds a conceptual network of this knowledge focused on the concept of energy. Based on this comparison, we found out which concepts the students used and recovered from their long-term memory. Another element to which we have focused our attention was the hierarchical layout of the concepts in the map created in the mind of the students. Through this research, we have identified if students can perceive energy within a single comprehensive view at the level of their education. © 2019 Author(s).

AB  - This contribution seeks to draw attention to the integrated use of different languages (graphic, visual, audio-visual…) in relation to the development of an innovative didactics. A multimodal and multimedia approach to didactics relates to the possibility to stimulate and trigger pre-knowledge adequate to the objects of learning, to develop the capacity to problematize, to foster processes of acquisition and re-elaboration of knowledge. In respect to this specific field, the results of an explorative investigation conducted in two university courses proposed by the Department of Education Sciences of the University of Bologna are presented. Indeed, within these courses, special emphasis was given to the use of visual and audio-visual languages to elicit the creation of multiple and original points of view, through activities based on encounters and sharing. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

AB  - The initial and continuing training of natural science teachers should be implemented in interdisciplinary contexts. This paper shows how concept maps can generate training activities in which teachers of various disciplines can discuss macro concepts such as water, air, wind, temperature, motion, power, energy, etc. mapping the students' learning pathway. Drawing concept maps and discussing them in training sessions from the perspective of students, teachers and trainers can be a decisive professional experience in changing the ways of improving concepts representations of all the actors of classroom activities and educators. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - In recent years, the flipped learning teaching model has attracted much attention. To ensure that students participate in the activities of watching instructional videos at home, it is important to design an efficient learning strategy for students to learn at home and in class. In this study, we integrate the personalization mechanism into a flipped learning 'Computer Science' course (n = 138) to improve students' engagement and learning achievements. Moreover, some studies have indicated that concept maps can help students to construct their knowledge. When students learn difficult chapters of Computer Science, they need to understand the structure. Therefore, after they have finished their personalization mechanism flipped learning, they have to draw a concept map of what they have learned on the system. More importantly, the personalization mechanism flipped learning system can record students' learning behavior and analyze it. Using the system records, we can investigate the different behaviors of the experimental group and the control group. © 2019 IEEE.

AB  - Numerous reports decry the deficiencies in thinking skills of students at all educational levels. Students had memorized and could apply the equations and problem-solving procedures without understanding the physics concepts they were representing mathematically. An effective method for supporting the representation of learner knowledge through multiple formalisms is to use computers as mindtools to represent their knowledge. Mindtools are computer software applications, like databases, spreadsheets, semantic networking programs, expert systems, systems modeling tools, microworlds, hypermedia authoring tools, and computer conferencing, that enable learners to represent what they have learned and know using different representational formalisms. Semantic organization tools enable learners to analyze and organize what they know. Two of the most commonly used semantic organization tools are databases and semantic networking tools. Database management systems are computerized filing systems designed to accelerate the storage and retrieval of information. Semantic networking tools provide visual screen tools for producing concept maps. © 2020 Taylor and Francis. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study is to examine a week-long science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (PBL) activity that integrates a new educational technology and the engineering design process to teach middle and high school students the concepts involved in rotational physics. The technology and teaching method described in this paper can be applied to a wide variety of STEM content areas. Design/methodology/approach: As an educational technology, the dynamic and interactive mathematical expressions (DIME) map system automatically generates an interactive, connected concept map of mathematically based concepts extracted from a portable document format textbook chapter. Over five days, students used DIME maps to engage in meaningful self-guided learning within the engineering design process and STEM PBL. Findings: Using DIME maps within a STEM PBL activity, students explored the physics behind spinning objects, proposed multiple creative designs and built a variety of spinners to meet specified criteria and constraints. Practical implications: STEM teachers can use DIME maps and STEM PBL to support their students in making connections between what they learn in the classroom and real-world scenarios. Social implications: For any classroom with computers, tablets or phones and an internet connection, DIME maps are an accessible educational technology that provides an alternative representation of knowledge for learners who are underserved by traditional methods of instruction. Originality/value: For STEM teachers and education researchers, the activity described in this paper uses advances in technology (DIME maps and slow-motion video capture on cell phones) and pedagogy (STEM PBL and the engineering design process) to enable students to engage in meaningful learning. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - The development and interest in mathematics textbooks in Indonesia have a considerable increase in the last decade. In this study, we discuss on structure analysis of Indonesian mathematics textbooks in Relation and Function Topics. We focused structure analysis of mathematics textbooks for 8th-grade students. Three Indonesian mathematics textbooks were analyzed for this study. An analysis framework was developed to investigate the characteristics of the structure in the textbooks from three perspectives: the physical features, the schematic of the math contents in the textbooks, and the patterns in the sequencing of content. We counted the distribution of block types, contents and performance expectation types to help us in examining and analyzing the structure of textbooks in relation and function topics for 8th grade. Our analysis showed that the three textbooks generally have a common structure. Firstly, the textbook A has more pages than the others. Mostly the textbook provided many learning activities with a scientific approach. Secondly, the schematics showed that the brief of structure of the three textbooks which have a common structure: 1) illustration about relation and function; 2) a concept map; 3) a set of narrations, learning activities, worked examples, and exercise to help students in understanding the topics; and 4) a competency test to examine whether students have achieved the aims of learning or not. Lastly, the patterns in sequencing content of the three textbooks showed that they have different patterns. Based on the results, recommendations are given for investigating the linkage between the structure of textbook and performance expectation in order to do further research on these topics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - One challenge associated with introducing systems thinking in chemistry classrooms is the increase in content complexity that students face when they engage in this type of approach. Placing core chemical ideas within larger systems has promise, as long as students are not overwhelmed by the added complexity. Although there are many potential strategies for dealing with complexity, one common tool is to employ visual or graphical tools to help conceptualize the problem or system at hand. In part because systems thinking touches on many potential levels of implementation, there are different visual tools that are helpful in conceptualizing different aspects. Some tools, such as systems-oriented concept map extension (SOCME) diagrams and systemigrams, use methodologies often associated with concept mapping but add features that enhance their applicability in systems thinking. Object-Process Methodology (OPM), which has seen fairly wide use in systems engineering contexts, uses formally defined components and links between them to help conceptualize systems and problems. Many systems of interest are dynamic in nature so tools such as behavior over time graphs (BOTG) are helpful in calibrating the temporal aspects of systems. Such dynamics are also captured via causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams. Here, we introduce and describe the affordances of multiple types of graphical tools that can be used to support systems thinking approaches in chemistry education. Knowing the uses and advantages of these different tools will allow instructors to make informed choices about the tools that will best meet a particular educational goal when using systems thinking approaches in the classroom.

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking (CT) studies in e-learning settings to provide a comprehensive analysis of CT studies. Research indexed in the Web of Science database which includes major peer-reviewed social sciences citation index journals in the e-learning field from January 2006 to November 2017 was searched for a systematic review and analysis. A total of 42 studies were selected and synthesized. The distribution of publishing years, geographical areas, education sectors, publications, disciplines, research methods, activities, CT measurement instruments, teaching instruction, the CT roles applied in the studies, and the experiment durations were reviewed. The results showed that most CT studies were conducted in nontraditional teaching environments using strategies such as online discussion or concept mapping; the most used quantitative method was the California critical thinking skills test (CCTST), whereas the most frequently adopted qualitative method was the practical inquiry model of cognitive presence (PIMCP). The common method to enhance students’ CT was online synchronous or asynchronous discussion, and the role that CT played in these studies was as a dependent variable for evaluating whether the designed e-learning instruction(s) can cultivate CT. This study concludes that with active learning instruction and experienced tutor facilitation, students’ CT could be enhanced in a variety of e-learning environments. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Two common goals of science teacher professional development (PD) are increased content knowledge (CK) and improved readiness to teach through inquiry. However, PD assessment challenges arise when the context is structured around inquiry-based, participant-driven learning, and when the content crosses scientific disciplines. This study extended the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool for examining changes in the content knowledge of 21 high school science teachers who participated in a field-based environmental science summer institute. The scoring rubric focused on documenting concepts, links, and map organization and scope in an attempt to capture development of cross-disciplinary knowledge in ways that correspond with theories of expertise development. The analysis revealed significant gains from pre-PD to post PD maps in the sophistication of links between concepts and in the number of additional, participant-generated scientifically valid concepts. Relative to the initial maps, post PD maps also manifested more complete clustering of concepts. Findings are discussed in reference to previous studies on teachers’ learning and implications for future research using concept mapping as a means of assessing teacher PD. © 2019, © 2019 Association for Science Teacher Education.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the ability of physics teacher candidates’ to read a concept map previously prepared by the researchers about a light topic and then convert the concept map into the appropriate text. The study was carried out in the form of case study method in a Turkish University in the Black Sea Region with 32 physics teacher candidates in the 2016–2017 academic years. To collect data, the concept map about light was given to the physics teacher candidates and they were asked to convert this concept map into meaningful text. The meaningful texts that teacher candidates tried to transform according to the concept map were evaluated according to a reference text. The reference text was prepared by experts. When the findings obtained from the study were examined in general, it was concluded that 78.123% of these physics teacher candidates could read the concept map related to light subjects and concepts at medium level. According to the results of this study, it is recommended that studies related to reading concept maps should be studied for different subjects and concepts. © International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

AB  - Concept mapping between two different ontologies in the biomedical field are commonly conducted. When one of the ontologies changes, the changes should be propagated to the other ontology in the mapping. This propagation process is an issue that must be addressed because the knowledge in biomedical field develops rapidly. In this paper, we present the change propagation method from Gene Ontology (GO) to Medical Subject Headings (MeSH). The change propagation is conducted by mapping GO change operations into MeSH change operations. There are three steps that must be performed. Firstly, the change operations on each ontology are identified and represented formally. Secondly, change operations in both ontologies are classified and compared. Finally, each GO change operation is mapped into a MeSH change operation based on the semantic meaning of the change operation. A proof of concept is also presented to show how the process works. In the experiment, the method has been applied to ten concept deletion operations of GO, with 80% of operations being successfully propagated to MeSH. The 100% success cannot be achieved because some GO concepts do not have relevant corresponding MeSH concepts due to the specificity of GO concepts. © 2020, Intelligent Network and Systems Society.

AB  - Lately the industrial revolution era 4.0 has become a discourse in various fields. One of them is education. The education sector is the front guard of the country. In the field of education, there needs to be a plan that is structured in the making of teaching materials because teaching materials are the main learning for students. This study aims to describe and analyze teachers and students on the national curriculum teaching materials based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The study was involving grade XI 233 senior high school students and 3 physics teachers. The method is used in this study with sequential explanatory. The research instrument used questionnaires, interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The results showed that to support STEM learning in national curriculum needed teaching materials to include lesson plans, books, animation, stimulation, and video. Components of book teaching materials include core competencies, basic competencies, indicators, objectives, concept maps, pictures, videos, animations, material that is explained in detail in each chapter, detailed discussion, internet links, summaries, and questions. The video components include core competencies, basic competencies, goals, indicators, abducting, using everyday language, complete materials and easy to understand. The material needed to develop teaching materials in physics between stationary waves, dynamic and static electricity, temperature and heat and Newton law. All teaching materials are expected to be based on e-learning or mobile learning. In the national curriculum, the teacher has not started STEM-based teaching materials. So in the future, there needs to be the development of STEM-based teaching materials to support the national curriculum that is designed to the maximum. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Like some other countries, seldom being sometimes addressed in classes, the Earth system approach is not emphasized enough in Portugal, nor is the interconnection between the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. To evaluate the Earth system holistic view of a group of 8th grade (13–15 years old) Portuguese students from a public school of the north of Portugal, an improved conceptual map-based to approach Earth system was investigated. After learning about concept mapping, students were asked to collaborate in the production of four conceptual maps regarding each one of the geochemical and biogeochemical cycles, further combining these maps in a common one. Through teamwork-based task, each group was asked to establish relations between the cycles, integrated into each one of the four Earth subsystems. The final combined maps demonstrated that, in the first phase, students had some difficulties in completing the pre-designed improved maps, being more evident in the rock cycle. Contrarily, the food chain cycle revealed fewer mistakes and more appropriate terms were added. In the second phase, the students exhibited difficulties in relating the cycles to the four subsystems and the remaining cycles, drawing many arrows without any kind of connecting words. Nevertheless, in general, students have realized how to build an improved concept map but do not possess a holistic view of the Earth system. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Educating the next generation of physicians is a key means of communicating and disseminating impactful immunologic scientific knowledge, and its practical application to human disease. We present our perspective, using as our model a first-year medical school course entitled Host Defense. As the name suggests, immunology is the overarching principle that links the multiple subjects in the course. We address a range of immunologically relevant topics, including innate and adaptive immunity, vaccines, inflammation, allergy, tumor immunotherapy, transplantation, and autoimmunity. These topics are integrated with the fields of infectious diseases, pathology, clinical laboratory testing, and public health, to illustrate how the basic science discoveries in immunology are relevant to clinical practice. The course objectives are not only to deliver “first principles” and molecular mechanisms, but also to connect these principles with the clinical world of diagnosis and therapy. We detail the different methodologies used to achieve these objectives and to reach today's medical students. This provides a framework for course structure and execution designed to engage both the novice and the more “immunologically experienced” learner. The framework includes classical didactic components and personalized instructor access, aligned with current approaches to self-directed learning and using digital media. We also address some of the challenges of assembling a course like Host Defense in the context of an academic medical center with multiple scientific, educational, and clinical missions. This perspective is not meant be proscriptive, but rather to outline our experiences on the strategies tried, while describing their advantages and drawbacks in teaching immunology. © Copyright © 2019 Haidaris and Frelinger.

AB  - As an instructional tool, models can transform the student experience from the static to the dynamic, the flat to the 3D, and the siloed to the integrated. Few practical resources exist to help instructors transition toward model-based classroom practices. The Modeling in the Classroom evidence-based teaching guide provides instructors with a tool kit for incorporating models and modeling into their classrooms (https://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/modeling-in-the-classroom). The guide discusses the underpinnings of modeling as a core scientific practice, one that can enable student development of systems thinking skills and understanding of biological concepts. The guide describes a variety of model types, including phylogenetic trees, simulations, animations, diagrams, conceptual models, concept maps, and tactile models supported by summaries of and links to articles and resources. In this paper, we will introduce key findings describing why and how to use models in the classroom. We also describe open research questions needed to address classroom implementation, instructional design, and development of students’ knowledge and skills. It is our hope that the guide will provide a suitable combination of research-based findings and practical suggestions that instructors will be supported and encouraged to thoughtfully incorporate modeling to support learning goals. © 2020 K.

AB  - Purpose: Concept maps have been described as a valuable tool for exploring curriculum knowledge. However, less attention has been given to the use of them to visualise contested and tacit knowledge, i.e. the values and perceptions of teachers that underpin their practice. This paper aims to explore the use of concept mapping to uncover academics’ views and help them articulate their perspectives within the framework provided by the concepts of pedagogic frailty and resilience in a collaborative environment. Design/methodology/approach: Participants were a group of five colleagues within a Biochemical Science Department, working on the development of a new undergraduate curriculum. A qualitative single-case study was conducted to get some insights on how concept mapping might scaffold each step of the collaborative process. They answered the online questionnaire; their answers were “translated” into an initial expert-constructed concept map, which was offered as a starting point to articulate their views during a group session, resulting in a consensus map. Findings: Engaging with the questionnaire was useful for providing the participants with an example of an “excellent” map, sensitising them to the core concepts and the possible links between them, without imposing a high level of cognitive load. This fostered dialogue of complex ideas, introducing the potential benefits of consensus maps in team-based projects. Originality/value: An online questionnaire may facilitate the application of the pedagogic frailty model for academic development by scaling up the mapping process. The map-mediated facilitation of dialogue within teams of academics may facilitate faculty development by making explicit the underpinning values held by team members. © 2019, Joana G.

AB  - Background: As health care technologies continue to advance rapidly, resulting in improved standards of practice, it is essential for health care professionals to continually expand on their current skills and knowledge. We describe here an initiative to use open education resources to provide ongoing education in radiation medical sciences and imaging. Aims: The aim of this study to design an interactive, engaging, multilevel radiation medical physics resource, which is fully open to the public, and functional on all types of computing devices. Our primary target audiences are students and workers in medical radiation technology and other health care professionals as part of their continuing professional development. Design and Development: The three tasks of design, development, and content creation were most efficiently performed in parallel wherever possible. A modern responsive web design was adopted to target all desktop and mobile devices. Only open-source tools and libraries were used in developing the OpenPhys website. Overall Website Design and Navigation: The homepage is a modern tile-based design containing one coloured tile for each lesson. Clicking anywhere on a coloured lesson tile will open up a two-dimensional interactive concept map linking to content pages. Currently, 10 lessons are available online ranging from the electronic structure of the atom to MRI basics: “NMR” and “Inside a Pixel”. Lesson pages include text, images, graphics, equations, quizzes, and interactive animations. User Feedback: An online questionnaire was emailed to current radiation therapy students at the University of Alberta and alumni regarding the functionality and navigation of the website. Discussion/Conclusion: To our knowledge, OpenPhys is the first open education resource specializing in radiation physics and medical imaging. We believe OpenPhys will fill existing gaps in the realm of physics education delivery and could be a component of a blended learning initiative. Future steps will include a formal evaluation of the website and content. © 2019

AB  - Today’s rapidly changing world calls for sustainability-minded scientists who are prepared to solve complex, interconnected problems. Service learning is a pedagogical approach that allows students to engage with the needs of the community by integrating academic work with complex civic issues. Student learning was examined during a short-term ser-vice-learning experience focused on water-quality monitoring in an urban watershed to determine whether community-engaged fieldwork in an upper-level ecology lab course enhances sustainability knowledge for future biologists. We used concept map scoring methods and reflection assessments to evaluate and understand changes in the structure and content of student knowledge as a result of the experience. Students showed increas-es in sustainability knowledge breadth, depth, and complexity, particularly in demon-strating biological-sociological connections. Student reflections indicated most students identified at least one community-engaged serving-learning objective as a result of this experience. These results suggest that community-engaged fieldwork can illustrate eco-logical and sociological sustainability concepts for students and that engagement works best when we make explicit our objective of engaging communities in the learning pro-cess. Short service-learning experiences are effective, can be quickly assessed using con-cept maps, and can be readily incorporated in other classrooms to enhance sustainability education. © 2020 J. L.

AB  - Conceptual change theories assume that knowledge structures grow during the learning process but also get reorganized. Yet, this reorganization process itself is hard to examine. By using concept maps, we examined the changes in students’ knowledge structures and linked it to conceptual change theory. In a longitudinal study, thirty high-achieving students (M = 14.41 years) drew concept maps at three timepoints across a teaching unit on magnetism and electrostatics. In total, 87 concept maps were analyzed using betweenness and PageRank centrality as well as a clustering algorithm. We also compared the students’ concept maps to four expert maps on the topic. Besides a growth of the knowledge network, the results indicated a reorganization, with first a fragmentation during the unit, followed by an integration of knowledge at the end of the unit. Thus, our analysis revealed that the process of conceptual change on this topic was non-linear. Moreover, the terms used in the concept maps varied in their centrality, with more abstract terms being more central and thus more important for the structure of the map. We also suggest ideas for the usage of concept maps in class. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Latinos represent a critical resource of talent that could be cultivated to expand the HIV research workforce. However, their rapid growth, as the largest and fastest growing ethnic minority group in the US population, has yet to translate into a significant increase in Latino health academic researchers. Historically, strategies to build a diverse research workforce have grouped together individuals from underrepresented minority populations obscuring significance between and within group differences. This limits approaches that are responsive to the diversity of needs and experiences of emerging investigators from underrepresented groups. In this article, we discuss challenges associated with heterogeneity of Latinos and barriers that impede research independence/ career success in the context of a review of Latino-investigator targeted mentorship approaches on the behavioral-social science of HIV infection. Mentorship workforce strategies could benefit from a personalized framework emphasizing individualized and tailored approaches to address the limitations and gaps in knowledge regarding Latino research development. This perspective encourages increased emphasis on organizational and structural processes to aid in overcoming institutional-level barriers that impede research and career development. Recommendations are proposed for features and components of effective mentorship programs that will lead to robust outcomes for strengthening the Latino research workforce in the HIV research field and elsewhere. © 2020 Ethnicity and Disease, Inc..

AB  - Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a molecular imaging elective course that would expose Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students to fundamentals of various imaging modalities and their pre-clinical and clinical applications. Methods: The “Surveys of Multi-Modality Imaging” course is a two-credit hour elective course offered to third-year PharmD and doctoral students. Experiential learning methods including active learning application-based exercises were used to supplement didactic lectures in the form of field trips (with follow-up debriefings), small group team-based tasks, hands-on demonstrations, visual modelling, gamification with problem sets, concept maps regarding given modalities, and concluding with written summary reports and formal in-class group presentations. In addition to standard course evaluations, a pre- and post-course survey were conducted to assess the students' confidence regarding course content. Results: Since its implementation in 2013, 101 students have completed the course with 72% being PharmD students (n = 73) and the remainder being doctoral students in pharmaceutical science (n = 28). Pre- and post-assessments completed by the students the last two offerings (n = 40 of a possible 43) indicated a shift in students' self-reported confidence in discussing imaging modalities from a total of 2.4% confidence (pre-course) to 97.4% confidence (post-course). Also, post-course survey indicated that 77.5% (n = 31 of 40 participants) students strongly agreed that our immersive and experiential learning activities were beneficial to overall learning for this elective. Conclusion: Students who participated in this innovative experiential learning-grounded course gained an appreciation for molecular imaging and its value and role in modern drug therapy. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Structured query language (SQL) is difficult to master because the execution process of SQL statements is invisible. When learning to construct an SQL query, learners must visualise the evolution process of the intermediate datasets of the SQL statement in working memory, which may burden learners' cognitive load and consequently jeopardise learning outcomes. This study describes the execution process of SQL statements by using concept maps to improve learners' understanding of SQL. An empirical experiment was conducted using two database courses, namely concept map-based and conventional instruction, to examine the relationship between concept maps and the understanding of SQL from a cognitive load theory perspective. The experimental results demonstrated the superiority of concept map-based instruction over conventional instruction because concept map-based instruction reduces extraneous load but increases germane load. Concept map construction facilitated learner engagement and promoted meaningful learning. Studying the instructors' concept maps helped learners follow the cognitive structures used by instructors to perform SQL queries, and enabled them to perceive the execution process of SQL queries relatively easily. These results potentially help educators understand the learning difficulties caused by the declarative nature of SQL and motivating researchers to resolve the inherent problem by considering learners' cognitive processes. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Introduction People with depression, anxiety, or psychosis often complain of confusion, problems concentrating or difficulties cognitively appraising contextual cues. The same applies to people with neurodegenerative diseases or brain damage such as dementia or stroke. Assessments of those cognitive difficulties often occurs in cross-sectional and controlled clinical settings. Information on daily moment-to-moment cognitive fluctuations and its relation to affect and context is lacking. The development and evaluation of a digital cognition task is presented. It enables the fine-grained mapping of cognition and its relation to mood, intrapersonal factors and context. Methods The momentary Digit Symbol Substitution Task is a modified digital version of the original paper-and-pencil task, with a duration of 30 seconds and implemented in an experience sampling protocol (8 semi-random assessments a day on 6 consecutive days). It was tested in the healthy population (N = 40). Descriptive statistics and multilevel regression analyses were used to determine initial feasibility and assess cognitive patterns in everyday life. Cognition outcome measures were the number of trials within the 30-second sessions and the percentage of correct trials. Results Subjects reported the task to be easy, pleasant and do-able. On average, participants completed 11 trials with 97% accuracy per 30-second session. Cognitive variation was related to mood, with an interaction between positive and negative affect for accuracy (% correct) (p = .001) and an association between positive affect and speed (number of trials) (p = .01). Specifically, cheerful, irritated and anxious seem to covary with cognition. Distraction and location are relevant contextual factors. The number of trials showed a learning effect (p < .001) and was sensitive to age (p < .001). Conclusion Implementing a digital cognition task within an experience-sampling paradigm shows promise. Fine-tuning in further research and in clinical samples is needed. Gaining insight into cognitive functioning could help patients navigate and adjust the demands of daily life. © 2019 Verhagen et al.

AB  - Metacognition is aspect in an effort to build students' understanding of chemistry. Preliminary study conducted at SMAN 1 Banjarmasin showed that only a few students who can evaluate their learning process, so that the ability of students using metacognition in learning process is still low. The guided inquiry assisted concept map with metacognition approach is an alternative to improving students' metacognition skills in learning process. The research was carried out using classroom action research design with two cycle. Each cycle consists of planning, action, observation and reflection stages. The subjects of this study were students of XI Natural Science 5 SMAN 1 Banjarmasin with 36 students. The research data collected using metacognition skills test instrument and non test instrument. Data were analyzed with quantitative descriptive and qualitative analysis. Metacognition skills of students has increased after treatment with guided inquiry assisted concept map. The process of implementation of the action is seen from teacher and student activity. Teacher activity increased from 71, 77 to 87.94. Student activity increased to 87, 4 from beginning at 68, 16. Implementation of quided inqury assisted concept map model with metacognition approach can improve students metacognition skill, student activity and teacher activity. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The flow of materials and energy through society is an integral but poorly visible element of global sustainability agendas such as the Planetary Boundaries Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). Given that the primary activities of chemistry are to analyze, synthesize, and transform matter, the practice of chemistry has a great deal to contribute to sustainability science, which in turn should play an increasingly important role in reshaping the practice of chemistry. Success in integrating sustainability considerations into the practice of chemistry implies a substantial role for chemistry education to better equip students to address the sustainability of earth and societal systems. Building on the framework of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project, we develop approaches to using systems thinking to educate students about the molecular basis of sustainability, to assist chemistry to contribute meaningfully and visibly toward the attainment of global sustainability agendas. A detailed exemplar shows how ubiquitous coverage in general chemistry courses of the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia could be extended using systems thinking to consider the complex interplay of this industrial process with scientific, societal, and environmental systems. Systems thinking tools such as systems thinking concept map extension (SOCME) visualizations assist in highlighting inputs, outputs, and societal consequences of this large-scale industrial process, including both intended and unintended alterations to the planetary cycle of nitrogenous compounds. Strategies for using systems thinking in chemistry education and addressing the challenges its use may bring to educators and students are discussed, and suggestions are offered for general chemistry instructors using systems thinking to educate about the molecular basis of sustainability.

AB  - The literature indicates that the use of mobile devices, wireless communication and sensing techniques can enhance students' learning in authentic environments and improve their learning effectiveness. Good learning strategy guides are essential for successful inquiry learning, and the question-posing strategy has been acknowledged as a type of high-level cognitive strategy that plays an important role in facilitating students' knowledge integration in the inquiry learning process. However, question posing seems challenging for many students and may lead to heavy cognitive load when appropriate scaffolding is not available. To solve this problem, the present research imported a concept mapping knowledge representation model as an auxiliary strategy for question-posing activities based on the research finding that visual knowledge representations are conducive to high-order thinking. It also developed a ubiquitous learning system which integrated multilevel concept mapping and question-posing strategy guidance to investigate the application effects of this learning model. A quasi-experimental design was applied, and an experiment was conducted to measure 5th graders’ learning of a plant unit of the natural science curriculum. Students in the experimental group learned with the proposed ubiquitous learning system based on the multilevel concept mapping and question-posing approach, while those in the control group learned with the ubiquitous learning system based on the question-posing approach. The results showed that the students in the experimental group significantly outperformed those in the control group from the perspectives of learning achievement and question-posing performance, but no significance was found in their cognitive load, meta-cognitive awareness, and science learning strategies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - The goal of this study was to identify and understand the mental models developed by 67 high school biology students as they learn about the human body as a complex system. Using concept maps, it sought to find an external way of representing how students organize their ideas about the human body system in their minds. We conducted a qualitative analysis of four concept maps created by each student throughout the 3-year learning process, which allowed us to identify that student’s systems thinking skills and the development of those skills over time. The improvement trajectories of the students were defined according to three central characteristics of complex systems: (a) hierarchy, (b) homeostasis and (c) dynamism. A comparative analysis of all of our students’ individual trajectories together revealed four typical learning patterns, each of which reflects a different form of development for systems thinking: “from the structure to the process level”, “from macro to micro level”, “from the cellular level to the organism level,” and “development in complexity of homeostasis mechanisms”. Despite their differences, each of these models developed over time from simpler structures, which evolved as they connected with more complex system aspects, and each indicates advancement in the student’s systems thinking. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - Systems thinking is a necessary skill towards solving complex civil engineering problems with interconnected environmental, social, and economic inputs and outputs. The dynamic relationship between systems components can act as a barrier for sustainability if decision makers work to reduce rather than understand complexities. To help advance methods for assessing and measuring students' ability to think in systems, multiple methods were used and compared, including: a previously developed 15-item self-report survey named Systems Thinking Scale Revised (STSR), three scoring approaches to concept mapping and advanced cognitive neuro-imaging methods to measure physical changes in cognition. Engineering students (n=28) completed the STSR survey to report their capacity of systems thinking. They were outfitted to wear a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system and asked to draw a concept map related to sustainability topics about energy, food, climate, and water. Their concept maps were scored using three approaches: the traditional, holistic, and categorical scoring method. The result shows that students' self-evaluated systems thinking tendency is negatively (Spearman's r = -0.50, p = 0.016) correlated with their concept map performance graded with the traditional scoring method, while positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.038) correlated to the sub-scores on the environment concepts using the categorical scoring method. Efficiency in brain connectivity, which is calculated using fNIRS data, is positively correlated with the complexity index using the categorical scoring approach (r = 0.45, p = 0.016) and the sub-scores of comprehensiveness in holistic scores (r = 0.42, p = 0.025). The results suggest students with higher performance of systems thinking were also more cognitively efficient. This study contributes to engineering education by demonstrating a new measurement tool to understand systems thinking and students' cognitive abilities. The results also demonstrate possible discrepancies in previously developed surveys, concept map scoring techniques and cognition measured through changes in cortical activation. This trans-disciplinary approach bridges engineering education, sustainability, and neuroscience and begins to open new avenues of research helping measure the effectiveness of assessment techniques with physical responses of cognitive activation. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

AB  - In recent decades, internationalization within higher education has emerged as a distinct field for practice and research. However, there are few meta-analyses of how the research trends and foci of this topic have evolved and shifted over time. This article analyzes the content of the Journal of Studies in International Education (JSIE), a central outlet for internationalization research, thus shedding light on overarching developments and trends within the field. In this investigation, the text-mining tool Leximancer™ is used to generate concept maps based on the titles and abstracts of all 406 scientific articles published in the JSIE between 1997 and 2016 (first issue). Four major developmental waves in this research area are revealed: delineation of the field (1997-2001), institutionalization and management of internationalization (2002-2006), consequences of internationalization: student needs and support structures (2007-2011), and currently, moving from the institutional to the transnational context of internationalization (2012-2016). The results show how the meaning of the concept has evolved to encapsulate several other related concepts in research on higher education, while reporting practices toward internationalization at individual, institutional, and national levels. © 2017, © 2017 European Association for International Education.

AB  - Planning, implementation, and evaluation of multicomponent, case-based learning for first-year Indian medical undergraduates. Adv Physiol Educ 43: 504-511, 2019; doi:10.1152/advan.00080.2019.-Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problemsolving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures. © 2019 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - The aim of this research was to reveal the relationship between student's reading interest and critical thinking skills through Reading Concept Map Group Investigation (Remap GI) and Reading Concept Map Jigsaw (Remap Jigsaw) learning models. To do so, two science classes from first grade of two Senior High Schools in Malang, Indonesia were selected as the participants of the study. They were given the reading interest questionnaire and critical thinking skills essay test after thought by two different learning models. The obtained data were analyzed through Pearson Product Moment Coefficient of Correlation and doing a statistical regression analysis. The result revealed that there was no correlation between two variables both in Remap GI or Remap Jigsaw class. Because of no correlation between two variables was found, two variables were compared through Remap GI and Remap Jigsaw using descriptive analysis. The finding of this study has some implications for teachers to consider some aspect or skills from students and their relationship with each other. So the teacher can predict what needs to be developed and how to do it. © 2018, Eskisehir Osmangazi University.

AB  - This paper discusses the application of concept maps in a senior level design course that is the second in a two course sequence in geotechnical engineering. A significant component of the course is an individual specialization project that requires students to research and investigate a topic related to geotechnical, geo-environmental, or geological engineering and synthesize the resulting information into a cohesive five thousand word paper and a five to seven minute multimedia presentation. The course culminates with each student being tasked with creating a concept map that ties their specialization topic to the course topics, previous course topics, specialization topics of other group members, and potentially to topics from other courses or personal experience. This paper presents an introduction to the benefits and limitations associated with concept map activities, an overview of the semester specialization project with a specific focus on the concept map activity, a discussion on the evolution of this activity, and an analysis of the developed concept maps. Concept maps are analyzed in both a qualitative manner with regards to themes developed in key concepts and connections and in a quantitative manner by considering the number of key concepts directly related to the course, the number of concepts related to other courses or outside topics, and the number of connections and cross-connections included. © The authors and IGS: All rights reserved, 2019.

AB  - Concept maps, which are network-like visualisations of the inter-linkages between concepts, are used in teaching and learning as representations of students’ understanding of conceptual knowledge and its relational structure. In science education, research on the uses of concept maps has focused much attention on finding methods to identify key concepts that are of the most importance either in supporting or being supported by other concepts in the network. Here we propose a method based on network analysis to examine students’ representations of the relational structure of physics concepts in the form of concept maps. We suggest how the key concepts and their epistemic support can be identified through focusing on the pathways along which the information is passed from one node to another. Towards this end, concept maps are analysed as directed and weighted networks, where nodes are concepts and links represent different types of connections between concepts, and where each link is assumed to provide epistemic support to the node it is connected to. The notion of key concept can then be operationalised through the directed flow of information from one node to another in terms of communicability between the nodes, separately for out-going and in-coming weighted links. Here we analyse a collated concept network based on a sample of 12 original concept maps constructed by university students. We show that communicability is a simple and reliable way to identify the key concepts and examine their epistemic justification within the collated network. The communicabilities of the key nodes in the collated network are compared with communicabilities averaged over the set of 12 individual concept maps. The comparison shows the collated network contains an extensive set of key concepts with good epistemic support. Every individual networks contain a sub-set of these key concepts but with a limited overlap of the sub-sets with other individual networks. The epistemically well substantiated knowledge is thus sparsely distributed over the 12 individual networks. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Despite increasing attention to STEM education worldwide, there is considerable uncertainty as to what constitutes STEM education and what it means in terms of curriculum and student outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the commonalities and variations in educators’ conceptualizations of STEM education. Sensemaking theory framed our analysis of ideas that were being selected and retained in relation to professional learning experiences in three contexts: two traditional middle schools, a STEM-focused school, and state-wide STEM professional development. Concept maps and interview transcripts from 34 educators holding different roles were analyzed: STEM and non-STEM teachers, administrators, and STEM professional development providers. Results: Three themes were included on over 70% of the 34 concept maps: interdisciplinary connections; the need for new, ambitious instructional practices in enacting a STEM approach; and the engagement of students in real-world problem solving. Conceptualizations of STEM education were related to educational contexts, which included the STEM education professional development activities in which educators engaged. We also identified differences across educators in different roles (e.g., non-STEM teacher, administrator). Two important attributes of STEM education addressed in the literature appeared infrequently across all contexts and role groups: students’ use of technology and the potential of STEM-focused education to provide access and opportunities for all students’ successful participation in STEM. Conclusions: Given the variety of institutionalized practices and school contexts within which STEM education is enacted, we are not convinced that a single worldwide definition of STEM education is critical. What we do see as essential is that those working in the same system explore the common elements that are being attributed to STEM education and co-construct a vision that provides opportunities for all their students to attain STEM-related goals. This is especially important in the current reform contexts related to STEM education. We also see that common conceptions of STEM education appear across roles and contexts, and these could provide starting points for these discussions. Explicitly identifying the ideas educators are and are not selecting and retaining can inform professional learning activities at local and larger scales. © 2018, The Author(s).

AB  - This study investigated the effects of teachers’ use of focus questions on students’ knowledge structures and classroom teaching-learning process by re-analyzing selected data from a quasi-experimental pre-post video study (Wadouh, 2007). Focus questions are content-related anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual lessons (Forbes & Davis, 2010). In Wadouh’ study, students answered a knowledge test before and after the lesson on “blood and the circulatory system” and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were re-analyzed for teachers’ use of focus questions—no focus questions, non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging focus questions. Individual students’ scores in the concept mapping exercise were aggregated as students’ topic-related knowledge structure. Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers’ use of specific and challenging focus questions on students’ topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students’ co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their pre-instructional ideas, whereas non-specific or simple focus questions anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific knowledge. This study’s limitations and implications for teacher education reform are discussed. © 2017, Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan.

AB  - Ontology is the study of groups or classes of things. It is a classification of concepts in a domain. Domain Ontology represents the concepts which belong to part of the world. Ontology along with set of individual instances of classes constitutes a knowledge base. In this paper, Domain Ontology of Computer Graphics is prepared using subject-predicate-object representation, where subject is a class or instance, predicate is property of class or instance and object is values of properties. This Ontology is then used for subjective evaluation of answers submitted by students in examinations. The statistical techniques, namely Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), BiLingual Evaluation Understudy (BLEU), Generalized Latent Semantic Analysis (GLSA), Maximum Entropy, and Hybrid Technique based on LSA and BLEU are used for performing evaluation of student answer along with Ontology. When the students' answers are to be evaluated, the details related to the concept are fetched from the Ontology. The point of access is provided by human examiner. When short questions are to be answered, then directly related information is fetched. When longer questions are to be answered, then more details are fetched using Ontology property, instances, and subclasses. After performing preprocessing, the students' answers are given as input along with subject-specific Ontology to statistical techniques. The sentences in each student answer are classified as belonging to an Ontology concept using statistical techniques. Then, total number of concepts found in each answer is divided by total number of concepts in concept map to generate the similarity score between concept map and student answer. The development and implementation of Ontology-based evaluation involve: development of Ontology, extraction of Ontology from RDF file, and implementation of statistical techniques in Java Programming Language. The Ontology is implemented with the help of Protégé tool. The developed application is tested using 10 questions of Computer Graphics. The techniques are tested both with and without Ontology. The OHYBRID technique shows the best correlation as compared to all other techniques. Maximum Entropy has correlation varying from 0.61 to 0.96. There is a lot of improvement in Maximum Entropy with Ontology. GLSA Ngram 1 and 2 do not show much improvement with use of Ontology as correlation varies from 0.44 to 0.87 for NGRAM1 and 0.41 to 0.84 from NGRAM2. The performance of the Ontology-based evaluation is compared with evaluation without Ontology. It is found that with use of Ontology the performance is more streamlined as individual feedback can be given to students. The feedback includes the concepts that are missing in student answer which is more near to human-like evaluation. It is concluded that use of Ontology makes the evaluation more thorough and near to accurate. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article argues that the development of rap song lyrics or lyrical concept mapping can be a viable pedagogical alternative to the development of concept maps as a means to reinforce STEM vocabulary. Hip-hop pedagogy is a culturally responsive pedagogy that leverages the funds of knowledge acquired from hip-hop culture. Unfortunately, many students with strong hip-hop cultural identities may lack equally strong mathematics identities. Given the success of hip-hop pedagogies within the science content area, we posit that hip-hop pedagogies are appropriate in other STEM content areas such as mathematics. Concept mapping is an instructional tool that has been empirically validated as an effective means to develop strong conceptualizations of mathematics content. While hip-hop pedagogy is well established in the science content area, it remains underdeveloped within mathematics education. We argue that the lyrical structure of a rap song is fundamentally similar to the structure of a concept map. This article provides a framework to support lyrical concept mapping as a culturally responsive instructional tool that can be used as an alternative to traditional concept mapping. Special attention is placed on the use of hip-hop pedagogy to affirm and empower dually marginalized students. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - The intentional omission of learning outcomes from the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education has caused concern and criticism from some librarians; however, the call to action within the Framework to locally develop learning outcomes is an opportunity to illuminate the social justice, critical thinking, and higher order thinking elements of information literacy. This study applies the transformative research paradigm using the methodology of concept mapping to test the development of learning outcomes for one of the frames. Concept mapping is a mixed-methods approach and includes focus groups, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. The methodology has been used extensively in the social sciences but has limited representation in the LIS literature. Though the study provides learning outcomes developed by a small participant group following the concept mapping method, the results demonstrate the viability of this methodology for librarians seeking a new approach to locally develop learning outcomes. © 2019, Communications in Information Literacy.

AB  - The paper presents the follow-up of a case study investigation with students of ESP (English for Specific Purposes) on a tertiary level (1st and 4th year students), consisting of collaborative learner-teacher activities, including concept mapping and content-based learning. The results of our project in progress are considered for an optimal adaptation of an ESP textbook which is intended for students in several areas related to the Life Sciences (Agriculture, Biotechnologies, Biology, Genetic Engineering, Horticulture, etc.). The framework of the course support we propose, as well as our methodology and tool kit are provided by ecolinguistics and the aim is achieving ecological learning and meaningful communication in the language class and beyond. The object of this exploratory study is to highlight the potential of collaborative learning environments, to enable students to employ conceptual mapping and find relations between significant concepts in the Life Sciences. The feedback was collected from ESP learners as materials were collaboratively selected and designed together with students, based on the construction of conceptual maps. The question raised in our preliminary study draws on a review of the literature pertinent to meaningful conceptual learning. Some of the key concepts addressed in the ecologically-designed English courses are analysed, focusing on feedback from the students and constantly adapting our findings to better serve their needs. © 2019, Centar for Quality.

AB  - Knowledge and motivation of a teacher are two unchallenged, essential characteristics for successful education. Whilst the relevance of teachers’ professional knowledge for successful students’ learning has been studied in a sophisticated manner for years, the meaning of teachers’ motivational orientations for students’ performance still lacks a differentiated consideration. This construct is conceptualized by three domains: (1) self-efficacy, (2) subject-specific enthusiasm, and (3) enthusiasm for teaching the subject. Motivational orientations overall have shown to be relevant predictors of students’ learning. However, there are several dimensions of motivation and their relative importance remains unclear. Our study goes beyond the available findings by considering in detail each of the three domains’ relations to students’ performance. Thus, we aim to further contribute to the clarification of the predictors of students’ performance in school teaching. For this purpose, we conducted a study with 48 biology teachers and their 1036 students. To assess the three domains of teachers’ motivational orientations, we applied paper and pencil tests. Concept maps and paper and pencil tests were used to measure students’ performance. By specifying multilevel structural equation models, we examined the relationship between the domains of teachers’ motivational orientations and the performance of the students. Our results reveal no relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ performance, but a significant positive relationship between the latter and teachers’ subject-specific enthusiasm. Moreover, our results show a positive trend in the relationship between enthusiasm for teaching the subject and students’ performance. The results provide a differentiated picture about the importance of motivational orientations for the characterisation of an effective teacher. We discuss our findings in terms of possible effect mechanisms and their relevance for further research on teacher motivation and the improvement of teacher education programmes. © 2018 Mahler et al.

AB  - Aim: To evaluate the use of CMAP tools® software as a teaching strategy of skeletal muscle components and contraction in undergraduates students of physical education. Methods: Nineteen students from the discipline of fundamentals of human physiology of the undergraduate course of physical education of the Centro Universitário Padre Anchieta were engaged in this study. Students were asked to divide into groups of three people and to bring a notebook with CMAP tools® software installed. During class, students were responsible for creating conceptual maps in CMAP tools® software describing each step of skeletal muscle components and contraction. To assess the effectiveness of this strategy in assisting learning related to skeletal muscle components and contraction, we created a visual learning scale (ranging from 0 (did not help) to 10 (helped a lot)) and applied to students at the end of the class. Results: From the students assessed, 47% scored 10 on the visual learning scale. Overall, 74% scored higher than 8 on the scale. Conclusion: The use of CMAP tools® software was effective in helping students understand concepts related to skeletal muscle components and contraction. © 2019 Universidade Estadual Paulista - UNESP.

AB  - Formative assessment is an exercise meant to enrich teaching-learning process. These methods are used to conduct in-process evaluations of student understanding, learning needs, and academic growth during a course. Formative assessments in engineering course are mostly implemented as assignments, multiple choice question, tests etc. Such methods are not engaging, motivating and does not give instant feedback to teachers to make necessary adjustments to modules and delivery techniques, and academic support. Wireless communication is one of the core telecommunication course which consists of students from computer science, mechanical and electronics engineering. In this course we have implemented two techniques: i) crossword puzzle, ii) concept maps in classroom. In this paper, we report the usage of these two methods as formative assessment techniques as we believe that they can evoke high level of engagement, recall, and retention. Though we have not yet conducted controlled studies for effectiveness evaluation of these formative assessment techniques, feedback response from student's reveals that 78% find the techniques engaging. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - The need for intelligent textbooks is keenly felt in the field of anatomy where students find the breadth and depth of the material challenging. To properly handle the complexity of the subject, a hierarchical causal concept map based ITS platform was developed. This system features a general purpose architecture which takes as input a specific instance of a concept map, allowing authors to build multiple ITSs for different topics. This system improves on its predecessors by introducing additional components to the concept map as well as multiple types of relationships. These improvements allow students the opportunity to interact with the topics at a deeper level than required by traditional textbooks. © 2019 CEUR-WS. All rights reserved.

AB  - Across disciplines, it is common practice to bring together groups to solve complex problems. Facilitators are often asked to help groups organize information about and better understand the problem in order to develop and prioritize solutions. However, despite existence of several methods to elicit and characterize how individuals and groups think about and conceptualize an issue, many are difficult to implement in practice-based settings where resources such as technology and participant time are limited and research questions shift over time. This paper describes an easy-to-implement diagramming technique for eliciting conceptualization and a flexible network analysis method for characterizing changes in both individual and group conceptualization. We use a case example to illustrate how we used the methods to evaluate African American adolescent's conceptual understanding of obesity before and after participating in a series of four systems thinking workshops. The methods produced results that were sensitive to changes in conceptualization that were likely driven by the specific activities employed during the workshop sessions. The methods appear strong for capturing salient levels of conceptualization at both individual and collective levels. The paper concludes with a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of the methods and implications for future practice and research. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Knowledge of key variables driving the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance over a vegetated surface is an important step to derive biophysical variables from TOA radiance data, e.g., as observed by an optical satellite. Coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) allow linking vegetation variables directly to the at-sensor TOA radiance measured. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of RTMs enables the computation of the total contribution of each input variable to the output variance. We determined the impacts of the leaf-canopy-atmosphere variables into TOA radiance using the GSA to gain insights into retrievable variables. The leaf and canopy RTM PROSAIL was coupled with the atmospheric RTM MODTRAN5. Because of MODTRAN's computational burden and GSA's demand for many simulations, we first developed a surrogate statistical learning model, i.e., an emulator, that allows approximating RTM outputs through a machine learning algorithm with low computation time. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) emulator was used to reproduce lookup tables of TOA radiance as a function of 12 input variables with relative errors of 2.4%. GSA total sensitivity results quantified the driving variables of emulated TOA radiance along the 400-2500 nm spectral range at 15 cm-1 (between 0.3-9 nm); overall, the vegetation variables play a more dominant role than atmospheric variables. This suggests the possibility to retrieve biophysical variables directly from at-sensor TOA radiance data. Particularly promising are leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water thickness and leaf area index, as these variables are the most important drivers in governing TOA radiance outside the water absorption regions. A software framework was developed to facilitate the development of retrieval models from at-sensor TOA radiance data. As a proof of concept, maps of these biophysical variables have been generated for both TOA (L1C) and bottom-of-atmosphere (L2A) Sentinel-2 data by means of a hybrid retrieval scheme, i.e., training GPR retrieval algorithms using the RTM simulations. Obtained maps from L1C vs L2A data are consistent, suggesting that vegetation properties can be directly retrieved from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of an atmospheric correction. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - In this chapter, eight foci relevant for science educators are presented and illustrated by paradigmatic examples and discussed in two parts. The first part “from science education to practice and authorities” discusses the four foci of (1) developing concepts for instruction; (2) responding to the needs of schools; (3) connecting researchers, teachers, and stakeholders; and (4) implementing research results into practice. The second part “from practice and authorities to science education” includes a further four foci, (5) reframing recent scientific research as science content for schools, (6) considering non-formal teaching-learning processes, (7) helping to create curricular and structural changes, and (8) being aware of his/her own responsibilities. The paradigmatic examples discussed are from recent research projects in science education, for example, the development of new instruments for formative and summative assessment, the comparison of different test formats like multiple-choice problems and concept map problems, the implementation of a new interdisciplinary curricula, the development of a so-called MobiLab, and the collaboration with scientists and entrepreneurs in nanoscience. It is discussed why the foci and examples are important to researchers and educators and which lessons can be learnt. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.

AB  - Background: In today's society, few adolescents meet physical activity guidelines and effects of physical activity promoting programmes are disappointing. In studies exploring determinants of physical activity, the perspective of adolescents themselves is largely lacking. Also, there is a lack of knowledge on potential environmental determinants of adolescent physical activity. Therefore, this study aimed to explore adolescents' perspectives on characteristics of an activity-friendly environment. Methods: Concept mapping meetings were conducted with four secondary school classes, including 115 adolescents (13-17 years). Each student generated ideas regarding the characteristics of an activity-friendly environment. For each school class, ideas were combined and identical ideas were removed. Next, students individually sorted all ideas, based on self-perceived similarity, and rated their importance on a five-point Likert-scale. A concept map was created for each school class using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis. Finally, the researchers named the potential environmental determinants within the clusters. Results: The concept maps depicted 23 unique potential determinants of activity friendliness, of which 15 were similar across all school classes. Potential determinants were categorized in the physical-, social-, economic-, and motivational domain. The most frequent and important adolescent-perceived determinants of activity friendliness across all school classes belonged to the physical domain, e.g. a suitable area including a proper surface for a variety of sports, and good lighting in the playground. Conclusions: Our findings show that adolescents perceive potential determinants in the physical and economic domain as most important for activity friendliness, indicating that future interventions might benefit from targeting potential determinants within these domains. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - In this paper, the authors describe the preliminary results of an on-going project consisting in the design of a textbook for English for Specific Purposes (ESP) to be used as support for students in several areas of the Life Sciences (Agriculture, Biology, Genetic Engineering, Horticulture, etc.). A case study was undertaken with students on a tertiary level (1st and 4th year students), which included collaborative learner-teacher activities, including the construction of concept maps based on keywords, the results of which are being considered for inclusion in the final textbook. The object of this study is to assess the opportunity of collecting feedback from learners with a view to including it in the textbook design, as well as materials collaboratively chosen and designed by the authors together with students. For this purpose, the research is supported by a conceptual methodological approach having an exploratory objective. The question raised in this study is answered by following a review of the literature related to some major key concepts to be acquired, as well as empirical observations of our ESP classes for the purpose of gathering relevant data from learners, followed by an analysis and discussion of the collected data. This analysis serves as preliminary considerations for our textbook focusing on feedback from the students, while also being a presentation of our outlook on the ESP course upheld for discussion. © 2019, Faculty of Engineering, University of Kragujevac.

AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student–student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students’ interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (R2 =.05) and supportive interactions (R2 =.16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (R2 =.07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (R2 =.07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (R2 =.28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this study, an integrated concept mapping and gaming-based learning approach was proposed to support mobile learning activities. To investigate the effects of the interaction between concept mapping and gaming on the participants' mobile learning outcomes, a quasi-experimental design was adopted and conducted for a learning activity of the elementary school course unit 'knowing the representative rocks in different geographical locations in Taiwan'. The participants were divided into three experimental groups and one control group. The experimental groups used the integrated concept mapping and gaming-based mobile learning approach, the gaming-based mobile learning approach and the integrated concept mapping and guidance-based mobile learning approach, respectively. On the other hand, the control group used the conventional guidance-based mobile learning approach. The experimental results showed that no interaction was observed between the gaming approach and the concept mapping approach. Furthermore, it was found that the concept mapping approach was not beneficial for students' learning achievement, while the gaming approach significantly improved their learning motivation, learning satisfaction and flow experience. Finally, discussion is provided to explain the findings, in particular, to infer why concept mapping did not achieve the expected positive impacts, as a reference for future studies.

AB  - Concept maps are graphical tools for organising, elaborating and representing knowledge. Through Cmap tools software, it can be explored the understanding and the hierarchical structuring of physics concepts among novice teachers. The software helps physics teachers indicated a physics context, focus questions, parking lots, cross-links, branching, hierarchy, and propositions. By using an exploratory quantitative study, a total 13-concept maps with different physics topics created by novice physics teachers were analysed. The main differences of scoring between lecturer and peer-teachers' scoring were also illustrated. The study offered some implications, especially for physics educators to determine the hierarchical structure of the physics concepts, to construct a physics focus question, and to see how a concept in one domain of knowledge represented on the map is related to a concept in another domain shown on the map. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - AIM The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of using concept maps as a teaching and learning strategy on students' critical thinking abilities and examine students' perceptions toward concept maps utilizing the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. BACKGROUND Researchers have found that almost two thirds of nurse graduates do not have adequate critical thinking skills for a beginner nurse. Critical thinking skills are required for safe practice and mandated by accrediting organizations. Nursing educators should consider teaching and learning strategies that promote the development of critical thinking skills. METHOD A literature review was conducted using "concept maps, nursing education, and critical thinking" as the combined search terms. Inclusion criteria were studies that measured the effects of concept mapping on critical thinking in nursing students. RESULTS Seventeen articles were identified. CONCLUSION Concept maps may be useful tools to promote critical thinking in nursing education and for applying theory to practice. © 2018 National League for Nursing.

AB  - The objective of this article is to develop an explanatory model of how a rehabilitation intervention functions within a sports context. Participants include three Coach-Educators (CEs) who organize and set up a rehabilitation intervention using ice hockey. In order to develop the model, two focus groups using the co-modeling methodology of Basque and Pudelko (2004) were conducted. Based on their experiences, the CEs illustrated and modeled the functioning of their intervention. A concept mapping software was projected on a screen to follow the co-modeling in real time. The first discussion group provided a first draft of the model which served as a starting point for the second. The data were analyzed in light of the Theory of change (Weiss, 1998). The CEs report that the objective of the intervention is social integration. This objective can be achieved either through the interaction of the activity components (i.e., youth, group, CEs, ice hockey, structured aspects), or by the CEs’ interventions involving four mechanisms: strengthening self-esteem, moving focus from oneself to others, destigmatization, and learning of prosocial behaviors. Many factors, such as gender, expertise and participants’ experiences were identified as having a positive or negative effect on achieving the objective of the program. Practical considerations and future research avenues are presented. For example, practitioners who use sport in the context of rehabilitation should be familiar with the characteristics and difficulties of the adolescents in Youth Centers and have a clinical rationale in relation to the problem underlying the intervention and its objective. © 2018, © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The purpose of the article is to identify conditions for the effective use of visual modeling tools that can help reduce the difficulty level of solving problems during the teaching high school students programming. Visual modeling tools are a type of software that allows you to create visual abstractions that reproduce concepts and objects of the real world with their relationships, which can help in solving the problem. In this paper, we focused on preformal models based on intellect- and concept-maps. The article gives a classification and describes techniques for using various visual modeling tools to solve problem tasks. Formed skills of working with such tools will allow students to produce, represent and express independently their knowledge. In addition, these tools allow structuring the process of solving the problem, optimizing the time for solving each stage of solving a problem task. The article presents the results of comparing the learning outcomes of the control and experimental groups, which show that the proposed visual modeling tools can help in solving the programming problem tasks. © 2019 16th International Conference on Cognition and Exploratory Learning in Digital Age, CELDA 2019.

AB  - Rich streams of fine-grained activity data are generated by many game-based learning environments. These data can be mined unobtrusively to assess student learning and potentially foster tailored feedback and scaffolding. Stealth assessment frameworks are more commonly seen in constrained virtual environments with clear goals and markers of progress; these diagnostic/formative-feedback strategies are more difficult to implement in open-ended environments with a larger range of potential activities and more variation in problem-solving strategies. This study investigates the potential for using a long short-term memory network (LSTM)-based model to enable stealth assessment in an immersive virtual world for learning. We investigate how well these temporally-sensitive models can predict learning gains on a pre-post survey, as well as predicting the quality of a student-generated concept map. This method is applied to log file data from a middle school science curriculum based on an open-ended immersive virtual environment. Results indicate that the LSTM-based model outperforms support vector machine and random forest models and can accurately predict performance without knowing pre-scores. This deep learning approach is promising for stealth assessment and formative feedback in open-ended virtual environments. © EDM 2019 - Proceedings of the 12th International Conference on Educational Data Mining.

AB  - Constraint plays a critical role in swaying the direction of concept ideation in conceptual design. Design constraints should be differentiated from design objectives because they play different roles in influencing ideation. Constraint management is a very challenging task in conceptual design because they are mostly abstract, subjective, and dynamic. This paper focuses on constraint management for the sake of concept ideation. In this work, design constraints are modeled as the initial and boundary conditions of concept ideation. A new classification scheme is proposed to classify various design constraints into four categories: input internal constraint, system internal constraint, input external constraint, and system external constraint. A new concept ideation process is prescribed to generate more constraint-compliant concepts, through biologically inspired design. Some existing design methods, such as Domain Structure Matrix and Concept Map, are incorporated into the proposed process. A case study is presented to showcase how to follow the proposed method to redesign a robotic vacuum cleaner to make it more compliant with stricter design constraints. © 2018 CIRP

AB  - Technology enhanced learning is a wide area that covers all uses of digital technology to support learning and teaching activities. The computer-based concept mapping has shown potential in enhancing meaningful learning in education. Concept mapping is an important tool that is used in the field of education to help students in understanding the basic concepts and the relationships between them. This research proposes a computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) environment combined with Google classroom to help students reduce their misconceptions and to improve their problem solving skills. Furthermore, it examines the effect of CBCM on the sustainability of concept learning according to student views. The participants were first-year engineering students. The study was conducted in a physics class, and a true-experimental design was used. The experimental group students learned with the Google classroom combined with computer-based concept mapping (CBCM), while the concept group students learned with Google classroom and the traditional method. Data were collected from a physics concept test, problem solving inventory, and semi-structured interviews. The research results indicated that teaching in the CBCM environment combined with Google Classroom provides meaningful learning by correcting the misconceptions of the students. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the problem solving skills of the experimental group as compared to the control group. According to the students' views, it was determined that CBCM enhances the sustainability of concept learning. The results of this study can help educators and researchers to integrate computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) techniques into Google Classroom. © 2019 by the authors.

AB  - Recently, advanced text-mining techniques have been shown to speed up manual data curation by providing human annotators with automated pre-annotations generated by rules or machine learning models. Due to the limited training data available, however, current annotation systems primarily focus only on common concept types such as genes or diseases. To support annotating a wide variety of biological concepts with or without pre-existing training data, we developed ezTag, a web-based annotation tool that allows curators to perform annotation and provide training data with humans in the loop. ezTag supports both abstracts in PubMed and full-text articles in PubMed Central. It also provides lexicon-based concept tagging as well as the state-of-the-art pre-trained taggers such as TaggerOne, GNormPlus and tmVar. ezTag is freely available at http://eztag.bioqrator.org. © Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Nucleic Acids Research 2018.

AB  - Background and aim Universal smoking cessation strategies are not always successful for minorities, among whom smoking is highly prevalent despite high intention to quit. This study identifies facilitators for smoking cessation, as perceived by minority male smokers, that can inform a culturally appropriate national plan for smoking prevention and cessation. Methods We conducted in 2013 a three-stage study among Arab minority male current and former smokers (ages 18–64) in Israel, among whom smoking is very high: first, a Concept Mapping (CM) study with 102 and 202 participants in the brainstorming, and sorting and rating phases respectively. Second, we assigned clusters identified in the CM study to contingency levels using the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM). Third, we classified clusters into intervention functions and policies using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW). Findings The CM study revealed 58 barriers and facilitators for smoking prevention and cessation that were sorted into 11 clusters by the participants. These clusters were analogous to four BEM level contingency of smoking (social, institutional, community and individual). We classified it into two main policy categories, based on the BCW: 1-restructuring the socio-political environment of smoking through affirmative government’s policies towards Arab minority in Israel, and 2-developing a culturally appropriate plan for smoking cessation in Arab local authorities including: raising awareness about tobacco hazards; enforcing anti-smoking laws; strengthening community institutional action; providing smoking cessation services; considering raising prices for tobacco products, addressing psychological sources of smoking in Arab men. Conclusions Our study revealed barriers, facilitators and contingencies of smoking prevention and cessation with two main policy action items among the Arab minority in Israel: changing the sociopolitical environment of smoking, and developing a culturally appropriate smoking prevention and cessation national plan. Our study framework can inform policies and culturally appropriate interventions for smoking prevention and cessation in other minorities. Copyright: © 2018 Daoud et al.

Using design science research methodology, we designed an artifact to collect time-series data on students’ self-regulated learning and conceptual thinking. Our artifact combines curriculum data, concept mapping, and structured learning diaries. We evaluated the artifact in a case study, verifying that it provides relevant data, requires a limited amount of effort from students, and works in different educational contexts. Combined with learning analytics applications and interventions, our artifact provides possibilities to add value for students, teachers, and academic leaders. © 2019, UTS ePRESS.

AB  - The production of a computer program requires learners to be skilled in basic concepts of programming, to master mathematical formulas, appropriate syntax usage, and in-depth knowledge of programming languages. Typically, in forming a program, students should be able to identify problems, generate algorithms, and convert algorithms into program code according to the syntax. Therefore, a Java programming course requires a student to master cognitive thinking in which, students can recover knowledge by using 'retrieval-based learning' as a basic recollection strategy in learning programming languages. The retrieval-based learning method refers to the following five waves: mnemonic, semantic, episodic context account, map concept, and quiz. Through these five waves, students should be able to implement retrieval method such as producing their own practice questions, quizzes, scan cards, to rewrite learning, repainting of learning, and concept maps. Instructional materials should include formative (topical) assessment, emphasis on text and content requirements, use of open-ended questions (subjective), answers or feedback, repeating exercises, and student achievement estimation. The main contribution is to create a descriptive Java programming lesson, which includes the choice of difficult topics, learning activities, teaching and learning modules, and online learning. However, the initial purpose of this study is to determine the most difficult topics in Java programming, the retrieval based learning used by students, as well as online student learning modules among students in Diploma of Computer Science (Programming) in vocational colleges. The instrument used to collect the data is through an online questionnaire and the findings were analysed using SPSS software by giving the percentage value for each element studied. The sample of the study was 110 students in Diploma of Computer Science (Programming) from four vocational colleges in Malaysia. The findings from the preliminary study conducted by the researcher are presented in detail in this paper. © School of Engineering, Taylor’s University.

AB  - This Research Work-in-Progress paper investigates engineering students' cognitive activities while completing linear and systems thinking tasks related to sustainability, which requires students to simultaneously utilize a large variety of constructs related to environmental, social, economic, and technical systems. To solve such interconnecting problems, systems thinking is necessary during decision-making rather than linear thinking modes that are more typical of solving closed-ended problem sets. This study uses an electroencephalogram (EEG) and self-report data to investigate engineering undergraduate students' cognitive activities when completing different tasks. We hypothesize that concept maps allow individuals to organize their thoughts within a systems thinking framework, and thus result in a more complete and holistic response than a linear thinking equivalent (i.e., listing task). We also hypothesize that creating a concept map is a more complex cognitive process than writing a list of terms and thus students (at least initially) would experience greater cognitive load while completing the concept mapping tasks. EEG and self-report measures of cognitive load will allow comparisons of undergraduate engineering students' performance on a linear or systems thinking task. Data collection is on-going so our paper will focus on methods, preliminary results, and future work. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (n = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (g = 0.58, p < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (g = 0.72, p < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (g = 0.43, p < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - This study is a qualitative-quantitative research, where the main concern is to investigate Content knowledge representation of Filipino Teachers in their schema (proposition, linear ordering and imagery) of some biology topics. The five biology topics includes: Photosynthesis, Cellular Respiration, human reproductive system, Mendelian genetics and NonMendelian genetics. The study focuses on the six (6) biology teachers and a total of 222 students in their respective classes. Of the Six (6) teachers, three (3) are under the Science curriculum and three (3) under regular curriculum in both public and private schools in Iligan city and Lanao del Norte, Philippines. The study utilizes interpretative case-study method, bracketing method, and concept analysis for qualitative part. For quantitative, it uses a nonparametric statistical tool, Kendall's Tau to determine congruence of students and teachers' concept maps and paired t-test for testing the significant differences of pre-and post-instruction concept maps to determine the effects of students' conceptual understanding before and after the teacher's representation of their schema that requires the teachers' thinking processes. The data were cross-validated with two or more techniques used in the study. The data collection entailed seven (7) months immersion: one (1) month for preliminary phase for the researcher to gain teachers' and students' confidence and the succeeding six (6) months for main observation and data collection. Results indicate that the teacher utilize six methods to construct meaning of concepts, three methods of representing classification, four methods to represent relationships, seven methods to represent transformation and three methods to represent causation in planning and implementing the lessons. They often modify definitions in the textbook and express these in lingua franca to be better understood by the students. Furthermore, the teachers' analogs given to student are sometimes far from the things, objects, events or processes being compared to. This suggests that teachers sometimes provide the condition for students' developing alternative conception through analogy/metaphors that they give. Also, the results suggest that there is significant differences between the pre and post instruction mean scores of concept maps before and after the teacher representation of their schema. Moreover, most of the topic (photosynthesis, human reproductive system, Mendelian and non-Mendelian genetics) studied have moderately or substantial to high agreement between the two groups. Hence, suggest that the teachers' representation highly influence student conceptual. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - s play the pivotal role of selling an article to a prospective reader, and for students, the ability to communicate science in concise written form may foster scientific thinking. However, students struggle with abstract composition, and we lack evidence-based educational innovations to help them develop this skill. We designed, implemented, and assessed an intervention for abstract composition with elements of scaffolding and transparency to ask whether deliberate practice improves concise scientific writing in early career undergraduate biology majors. We evaluated student performance by analyzing abstracts written before and after the intervention and by assessing pre- and posttest student concept maps. We found that scaffolded learning improved student abstract writing, with the greatest gains in students’ ability to describe the motivation for their work. Using a set of tested tools to teach scientific writing has important implications for strengthening students’ capacity to reinforce and synthesize content in the future, whether that is in laboratory course exercises, in independent research, or as a transferable skill to general critical thinking. ©2018 Author(s).

AB  - Mind maps are a study tool for students to visualize and organization in a way that emphasizes the way that concepts are connected to one another. Their use has been documented in several technical fields, including medicine, industrial engineering, and environmental engineering. Many publications on the use of mind maps or concept maps include one or more ideas on how to assess the quality of these diagrams. In this work in progress, we summarize different ways that have already been proposed and implemented in the literature to evaluate mind maps. Some rubrics view a map holistically, while others attempt to deconstruct maps into component pieces, like number of topics or number of connections, for scoring. We describe our experiences using some of these approaches in evaluating our own use of mind maps in the classroom. We have collected two years' worth of mind maps from the University of Delaware's Introduction to Chemical Engineering course as part of an end-of-semester exercise that is presented to students as a final exam preparation activity. We seek to address two questions using this activity: (1) Is there any relationship between the quality of mind maps and student performance in the course, and (2) Is there any significant change between the 2016 and 2017 student responses that may have resulted from changes made to the course between these years? Indirectly, we seek to determine whether mind maps would be a useful measure for direct assessment to track continuous improvement initiatives related to this course. We also seek to determine whether one established strategy for assessing mind maps is more amenable to addressing these questions than others. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2018.

AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented computer science courses as a way to increase the students' knowledge of programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, and to develop their higher-level thinking skills. We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review on the reviewers, and the results this has on the students' learning. To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students' level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts. © 2018 ACM 1946-6226/2018/09-ART13 $15.00

AB  - This study presents an ‘education for sustainability’ curricular model which promotes science learning in an elementary classroom through equity pedagogy. A total of 25 fourth-grade students from an urban, public school in Denver, Colorado participated in this mixed-methods study where concept maps were used as a tool for describing and assessing students’ understanding of ecosystem interactions. Concept maps provide a more holistic, systems-based assessment of science learning in a sustainability curriculum. The concept maps were scored and analyzed using SPSS to investigate potential differences in learning gains of English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Gifted/Talented (GT) students. Interviews were conducted after the concept maps were administered, then transcribed and inductively coded to generate themes related to science learning. Interviews also encouraged students to explain their drawings and provided a more accurate interpretation of the concept maps. Findings revealed the difference between pre-and post-concept map scores for ELA and GT learners were not statistically significant. Students also demonstrated an increased knowledge of ecosystem interactions during interviews. Concept maps, as part of an education for sustainability curriculum, can promote equity by providing diverse learners with different—yet equally valid—outlets to express their scientific knowledge. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Background: There is a great deal of variation in the design and delivery of patient navigator (PN) programs, making it difficult to design or adopt these interventions in new contexts. We (1) systematically reviewed the literature to generate a preliminary program theory to describe how patient navigator interventions are designed and delivered; and (2) describe how the resulting program theory was applied in context to inform a prototype for a patient navigator program. Methods: The current study includes a secondary review of a larger systematic review. We reviewed studies included in the primary review to identify those that designed and evaluated programs to assist patients in accessing and/or adhering to care. We conducted a content analysis of included publications to describe the barriers targeted by PN interventions and the navigator activities addressing those barriers. A program theory was constructed by mapping patient navigator activities to corresponding constructs within the capability-opportunity-motivation model of behavior change (COM-B) model of behavior change. The program theory was then presented to individuals with chronic disease, healthcare providers, and system stakeholders, and refined iteratively based on feedback. Results: Twenty one publications describing 19 patient navigator interventions were included. A total of 17 unique patient navigator activities were reported. The most common included providing education, facilitating referrals, providing social and emotional support, and supporting self-management. The majority of navigator activities targeted barriers to physical opportunity, including facilitating insurance claims, assistance with scheduling, and providing transportation. Across all interventions, navigator activities were designed to target a total of 20 patient barriers. Among interventions reporting positive effects, over two thirds targeted knowledge barriers, problems with scheduling, proactive re-scheduling following a missed appointment, and insurance. The final program design included a total of 13 navigator activities - 10 informed by the original program theory and 3 unique activities informed by stakeholders. Conclusions: There is considerable heterogeneity in intervention content across patient navigator interventions. Our results provide a schema from which to develop PN interventions and illustrate how an evidence-based model was used to develop a real-world PN intervention. Our findings also highlight a critical need to improve the reporting of intervention components to facilitate translation.

AB  - This paper describes and compares two categories of pedagogical design patterns that have emerged from CS education practice: lecture-based design patterns and active learning design patterns. Pedagogical design patterns provide faculty with combinations of generalized descriptions of problems and solutions that occur in teaching and learning. The benefit of forming design patterns is the codification of successful practice that can be reused in multiple scenarios and draw on the creativity of the instructor for defining the details relevant to the course and the students. Design patterns have been represented in many formats since Alexander's initial design pattern model highlighting different aspects of what is important in each domain in which the patterns are created and used. This paper analyzes design patterns emerging from recent developments in lecture-based pedagogy and active learning in CS education. Traditional lectures in computer science, engineering, and other STEM disciplines are being reconsidered due to research that shows that students are less likely to learn while listening and more likely to learn while actively engaged. Design patterns that address problems and provide potential solutions to traditional lectures in computer science education have been published that provide solutions to engage students during the lecture. The pedagogy of flipped classrooms and active learning have recently been adopted by many faculty in Computer Science leading to emerging design patterns for active learning. We compare how previously published lecture-based patterns and our active learning patterns address similar problems with different solutions to engaging students. We show how an object-based structure for pedagogical design patterns can provide additional information about the problems and the solutions addressed by the patterns that are more easily indexed and combined. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - In the last decade, as an emerging technique for business processes management, process mining (PM) has been applied in many domains, including manufacturing, supply-chain, government, healthcare, and software engineering. Particularly in healthcare, where most processes are complex, variable, dynamic, and multi-disciplinary in nature, the application of this technique is growing yet challenging. Several literature reviews, as secondary studies, reveal the state of PM applications in healthcare from different perspectives, such as clinical pathways, oncology processes, and hospital management. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping (SM) study which we conducted to structure the information available in the primary studies. SM is a well-accepted method to identify and categorize research literature, in which the number of primary studies is rapidly growing. We searched for studies between 2005 and 2017 in the electronic digital libraries of scientific literature, and identified 172 studies out of the 2428 initially found on the topic of PM in healthcare. We created a concept map based on the information provided by the primary studies and classified these studies according to a number of attributes including the types of research and contribution, application context, healthcare specialty, mining activity, process modeling type and notation/language, and mining algorithm. We also reported the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain; namely, publication volume, top-cited papers, most contributing researchers and countries, and top venues. The results of mapping showed that, despite the healthcare data and technique related challenges, the field is rapidly growing and open for further research and practice. The researchers who are interested in the field could use the results to elicit opportunities for further research. The practitioners who are considering applications of PM, on the other hand, could observe the most common aims and specialties that PM techniques are applied. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - In this research, the effects of using digitally supported concept maps on the academic success of students in science classes in primary education and their opinions toward the advantages of digitally supported concept maps were examined. The research was conducted with seventh-grade students in a state school in Turkey. This research used a quasi-experimental design with two groups employing a pre-test/post-test. A total of 44 students participating in this study: Twenty-two students in the experiment group and 22 students in the control group. The control group of students experienced the concept maps using pencil and paper (manual) while the experiment used digital education materials. The data were analyzed through t-test to determine whether there was a significant difference between academic success points and then analyzed through content analysis. According to the results of the research, the students who experienced the digitally supported concept maps increased their academic success. These students reported that "learning takes place more easily" through this method. The results of this research show that the students got entertained and motivated much more in the environments that digitally supported concept maps were used. © 2019 International Council of Associations for Science Education (ICASE).

AB  - The Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) was designed to advance understanding of complex oceanographic processes by acquiring large quantities of data at six key locations in the world ocean. The OOI Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization has built an educational cyberinfrastructure and developed interactive tools targeted for undergraduate-level learners that enable easy access to OOI data, images, and video. To develop the suite of OOI education tools, EPE used an iterative design process, including needs assessment, tool prototyping, and usability testing in undergraduate classrooms. Data visualization and concept mapping tools were envisioned as a way to help undergraduates link concepts students see in oceanography textbooks to real-world phenomena. A Data Investigation Builder (DIB) was constructed to assist professors in designing data activities. During the usability testing, professors provided valuable feedback that allowed EPE to improve the tools. Based on the lessons learned from EPE, in 2016 we developed a new prototype set of Data Explorations that were more modular and easier to integrate into an undergraduate lecture or problem set. This paper reviews how the EPE toolset was developed, including establishment of requirements for the tools and incorporation of lessons learned from the user needs assessment and the results of usability testing of prototype tools. © 2018 by The Oceanography Society.

AB  - In this paper, two novel feature extraction methods, using neighborhood structural similarity (NSS), are proposed for the characterization of mammographic masses as benign or malignant. Since gray-level distribution of pixels is different in benign and malignant masses, more regular and homogeneous patterns are visible in benign masses compared to malignant masses; the proposed method exploits the similarity between neighboring regions of masses by designing two new features, namely, NSS-I and NSS-II, which capture global similarity at different scales. Complementary to these global features, uniform local binary patterns are computed to enhance the classification efficiency by combining with the proposed features. The performance of the features are evaluated using the images from the mini-mammographic image analysis society (mini-MIAS) and digital database for screening mammography (DDSM) databases, where a tenfold cross-validation technique is incorporated with Fisher linear discriminant analysis, after selecting the optimal set of features using stepwise logistic regression method. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.98 with an accuracy of 94.57 is achieved with the mini-MIAS database, while the same for the DDSM database is 0.93 with accuracy 85.42. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This study focused on examining how students’ perception and understanding of the tissue engineering field changed as a result of their participation in a hands-on experiential learning module. The module involved the cellular and biochemical characterization of three-dimensional cultures of mesenchymal stem cells in chondrogenic media. Students were instructed to complete concept maps depicting their perception of the tissue engineering field both prior to and after completion of the module. Similarly, they had to respond to provided design prompts and identify experimental tests and questions for doctors that would allow determination of their adaptive expertise. The results from this study demonstrate that students significantly broaden their perception of the tissue engineering field through statistically significant changes in their comprehensiveness and correctness scores on the concept map rubric. Similarly, the results of the adaptive expertise analysis demonstrate that students significantly increased adaptive expertise upon completion of the module in comparison to their responses at the start of the module. These results imply that a hands-on experiential module can be a beneficial tool for teaching students the complexity associated with a multidisciplinary field such as tissue engineering. © 2018

The information was collected with the help of digital surveys implemented on the web. The results show that students use smartphones to communicate among them, they surf on the web for educational, recreational and occupational purposes. Also, students use word processors, spreadsheets and electronic presentations at a basic level. However, they are not able to use mind maps, concept maps, wikis, blogs, image or video editing tools; nor are capable of carrying out bibliographic searches in valid sources. In addition, the results indicate that the surveyed students need to enroll in extracurricular courses, that will enable them to develop the digital competences expected in a digital native. ©The Electrochemical Society.

AB  - In this paper we analyze the effects of the type of collaborative task (elaboration of concept map vs elaboration of expository summary) on the performance and on the level of collaboration achieved by Mexican university students in the multimedia learning of a social sciences content (Communication Psychology). Likewise, the processes of social regulation that are put into play in these collaborative tasks are described. Forty-five students (17 women and 28 men) grouped in 15 triads participated in the study. Each triad was assigned to one of the two collaborative conditions: elaboration of concept map (8 groups) and elaboration of an expository summary (7 groups). It was monitored that there were no significant previous differences between two conditions regarding: reading comprehension, reading comprehension regulation strategies and domain-specific prior knowledge. To evaluate the performance in learning, the quality of the proposals made in concept maps and summaries were taken adapting the procedure proposed by Haugwitz, Nesbit and Sandmann (2010), and also the results obtained by the students in a multiple-choice questionnaire about the knowledge area. Likewise, the level of collaboration perceived by each member of the teams was examined using a Collaboration questionnaire developed by Chan and Chan (2011). The identification and characterization of the processes of social regulation was carried out through a qualitative analysis of the exchanges registered during the collaborative activity, considering the type (co-regulation and shared regulation) and the regulation orientation (directed to the task or to the management of collaboration). The quantitative results analysis showed the existence of significant effects working with collaborative concept maps in the knowledge acquired during the collaborative task and in some of the indicators of perceived collaboration. Although no significant statistical differences were found, in the teams that elaborated expository summaries, a predominance of episodes of regulation directed towards the cognitive activity of the collaborative task was observed, being scarce, in both conditions, the episodes of social regulation directed towards collaboration within the triads. © 2018, Sciedu Press.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important skill in today's rapidly changing times, as industries and economies depend upon innovation. It is therefore a requirement for school graduates, especially those who strive towards a technical or scientific career. However creativity has not been integrated into curricula of STEM subjects in many European countries including Germany. To successfully incorporate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers' and student teachers' attitudes towards creativity, as they influence teaching and lesson planning. In cooperation with Kagoshima University, Japan, the possibility to investigate Japanese student teachers' conceptions of creativity and compare them with those of their German colleagues became available. This is of special interest as many differences exist between Germany and Japanese, such as the culture, society and educational system as well as different rankings in PISA and TIMSS. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate, compare and analyse the concepts and views of German and Japanese student teachers. To achieve this, a research instrument, including the creation of concept maps and a questionnaire have been used. In the evaluation of the data, an extensive qualitative analysis of the propositions in the concept maps and statements in the questionnaire were made. These were supported by structural and quantitative analysis. The results show that almost all the student teachers in this study had a positive attitude towards creativity, but there were differences in the understanding and implementation of creativity in the classroom. © 2022 Asia-Pacific Science Education.

AB  - Background: Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have deleterious effects on health across the lifespan. Educating health professionals for ACEs awareness and prevention facilitates quality care. Literature documents concept mapping as an effective teaching strategy used in health professions to stimulate learning and foster students’ critical thinking. However, ACEs curricular concept mapping remains unexplored. Method: Content analysis with manifest coding was used to identify key concepts based on faculty narratives and discussion notes about ACEs content. Results: Major and minor themes emerged to support the ACEs Curricular Concept Map development with direct and indirect paths to culture of health and health equity. Conclusions: The ACEs Curricular Concept Map was developed to guide teaching ACEs knowledge in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of ACEs curricular concepts on nursing students’ learning and graduates’ ability to translate knowledge to practice ACEs awareness and prevention toward health equity for all. © SLACK Incorporated.

AB  - This article describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students' understandings of particle physics, which was presented in the Special Session on Physics Education and Outreach at ICNFP 2017. Fifty-nine Year 12 (16- and 17-year-old) students from two London schools participated in the research. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were shown how to make a concept map and were provided with topic-specific key words. Their concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions the students had represented, and comparing these with propositions developed from the examination specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by most of the students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although some students may have been unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

AB  - In this study, researching the effect of a planned trip to one of the informal learning environments, zoos, on learning and taking students’ opinions about the trip were aimed. The working group consists of 15 fifth grade students. The Experimental method was used in this research. The academic achievement test developed by the researcher was applied to the students before and after the trip to determine the effect of the planned zoo trip on the students’ learning. To determine the change in students’ misconceptions, concept maps were drawn before and after the trip. For the students’ views about this learning experience, a semi-structured interview form was used. Pre and posttest results gotten from the achievement test were evaluated with Wilcoxon signed ranks test; the data obtained from the concept maps were analyzed with error frequencies, and the students’ judgments received from a semi-structured interview about this learning experience were examined with content analysis method. Results of the research showed that a well-organized zoo trip has a positive effect on learning; that there is a meaningful difference between students’ pretest and posttest academic achievement scores for the benefit of posttest; that it does not have any effect on misconceptions about general classification, however, it is effective on, more specifically, misconceptions about animal classification. Students have found this trip entertaining and informative. © 2019, Ankara University. All rights reserved.

AB  - Teaching Experimental Sciences is a compulsory subject in the Bachelor’s Degree in Primary Education (BDPE). It belongs to the discipline of Education and to the field of "Knowledge of the social and natural environment", and consists of a total of 24 ECTS, of which 6 ECTS correspond to "Teaching Natural Sciences" (TNS). This subject is taught in the second half of the second year of the BDPE. The aim of this work has been the presentation of this subject as a Knowledge Model (KM) including interlinked Concept Maps (CCMM) with different levels of deepness of the developed topics; and to check if this new way of presentation has a positive effect on students’ satisfaction towards the learning and teaching process (LTP) by inquiring about the meaningful learning and coherency of the contents by using CCMM. Results show although it is difficult to change from the comfort zone at the beginning, when students start using Cmap Tools for creating their own Knowledge Models, they finish learning meaningfully and understanding better the whole subject, find it easier to study for the evaluation and get to the domain of Knowledge by reaching basic, general and specific skills. © 2018 by authors, all rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to describe students' mental model in a mental model based-microbiology course using concept map as assessment tool. Respondents were 5th semester of undergraduate students of Biology Education of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. The mental modelling instrument used was concept maps. Data were taken on Bacteria sub subject. A concept map rubric was subsequently developed with a maximum score of 4. Quantitative data was converted into a qualitative one to determine mental model level, namely: emergent = score 1, transitional = score 2, close to extended = score 3, and extended = score 4. The results showed that mental model level on bacteria sub subject before the implementation of mental model based-microbiology course was at the transitional level. After implementation of mental model based-microbiology course, mental model was at transitional level, close to extended, and extended. This indicated an increase in the level of students' mental model after the implementation of mental model based-microbiology course using concept map as assessment tool. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The present study aimed to enrich the scientific evidence on obesity prevention programmes for adolescents from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds with practice-based experiences from both scientific and professional experts in the field of youth obesity prevention. We used the participatory method of concept mapping. Two concept mapping sessions were conducted: one with programme coordinators of national/regional obesity prevention programmes across Europe (n = 8) and one with scientists participating in European obesity prevention projects (n = 5). Five recommendations were extracted from both concept maps: (1) involve adolescents in the design and delivery of the programme, (2) invest in family/parental capacity building, (3) provide and support a healthy school food and physical activity environment, (4) regulate exposure to unhealthy messages/advertising and (5) facilitate safe and active travel. These recommendations can be used as a conceptual framework for programme development for preventing obesity in adolescents. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners’ knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners’ knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Situational case-based teaching is one of promising teaching strategies in engineering education, e.g., computer science and information security. This strategy is student-centered and can reinforce practical experience and context-aware problem solving. In this paper, we propose a novel evaluation framework by applying concept mapping to address the great concern of comparing different teaching strategies. Specifically, the proposed evaluation framework consists of four phases, i.e., concept map construction, concept map converting, multidimensional scaling and clustering analysis. The evaluating results based on concept mapping over a demo course reveal the following two statements: (a) Situational cases can help learners learn important concepts and organize their relationships with the goal of practical problem solving in engineering courses; (b) Compared with the conventional lecture strategy, the situational case-based one is helpful for learners to achieve high-level cognitive outcomes, e.g., antagonistic thinking. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - The purpose of this chapter is to show how several instructional strategies were incorporated into a senior-level forensic chemistry course, and how the strategies work together in a complementary fashion. Implementing a flipped classroom model allowed for class time to be used for team-based learning such as projects, activities, and quizzes. Class time was also used for instruction on and the exploration of generative learning strategies such as concept maps, drawing activities, practice testing, and summarizing activities. Generative learning strategies have been shown to promote the generalization and transfer of knowledge. The generative learning activities were designed in a way to help students understand the importance of constructing and interpreting information outside of class time as they study. These generative strategies were then used by students to complete weekly prelecture assignments. These instructional strategies were chosen in an attempt to maximize student engagement in the process of learning. © 2019 American Chemical Society.

AB  - There is a need for research to identify effective implementation strategies for injury prevention training within real-world community sports. The aim of this ecological participatory study was to identify facilitators, among stakeholders at multiple levels, that could help injury prevention training become part of regular training routines in youth team handball. Concept mapping, a mixed-method approach for qualitative data collection and quantitative data analysis, was used. Stakeholders (n = 196) of two community team handball clubs (29% players, 13% coaches, 38% caregivers, 11% club, district and national handball administrators, 9% unknown) participated in a brainstorming process. After the research team synthesized the 235 generated statements, 50 stakeholders (34% players, 22% coaches, 24% caregivers, 20% administrators) sorted 89 unique facilitator statements into clusters and rated them for importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis yielded five clusters (stress value 0.231): “Understanding and applying knowledge,” “Education, knowledge, and consistency,” “Set-up and exercises,” “Inspiration, motivation, and routines,” and “Club policy and expert collaboration.” The cluster “Understanding and applying knowledge” had the highest mean importance (3.17 out of 4) and feasibility (2.93) ratings. The 32 statements rated as both highly important and feasible (Go-zone) indicate action is required at the individual (end-users) and organizational (policymakers) levels to implement injury prevention training. Results suggest that developing evidence-based context-specific injury prevention training, incorporating physiological, biomechanical and psychological components, and an associated context-specific implementation plan in partnership with all stakeholders should be a high priority to facilitate the implementation of injury prevention training in youth team handball. © 2018 The Authors.

AB  - Some research findings showed that Indonesian students' critical thinking skills below average, especially those who have a low academic ability; even though that skills are needed to face this 21st century. There should be a strategy to train students to develop their critical thinking, one of them is by implementing an appropriate learning model. One of the alternatives is Reading-Concept Map-Timed Pair Share (Remap-TmPS) model. This study aimed to find out the effect of Remap-TmPS model and students' different academic ability towards their critical thinking skills on Biology. This research was conducted in Senior High Schools in Batu, East Java, Indonesia. Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Control Group Design was employed in this study and 116 students were involved as the participants. There were two experimental classes taught using Remap-TmPs and two control classes taught as well by using conventional learning. Data on students' critical thinking skills were collected using an essay test. The results of the test were assessed using the critical thinking skills' scoring rubric and an ANACOVA test. The research finding showed that students who have the low academic ability in Biology learning who taught by using Remap-TmPS have equal critical thinking skills or the same as students' who have high academic ability who taught by using conventional learning. So, learning Biology using Remap-TmPS can be used as an alternative for students' who have a low academic ability in order to enhance their critical thinking skills. © 2018 EdUHK APFSLT.

AB  - A growing number of publications have been exploring the possible effects of mindfulness-based interventions on teachers’ well-being and their professional lives. Notwithstanding promising results in this domain, this paper identifies some difficulties involved in introducing teachers to mindfulness and proposes that there may be a need to develop alternative routes by which to expose more teachers to experiences of mindfulness. We report on a mixed method study of a 5-week teacher learning program implemented in an Israeli middle school with 30 teachers, 28 of which were females, with an age range of 29–55. The program was designed to invite teachers into initial experiences with mindfulness without formally engaging in mindfulness practice but rather based on studying education-relevant brain theory through a contemplative pedagogical approach. Outcomes were analyzed quantitatively by comparing collaborative concept maps created by the participants before and after undergoing the program, and qualitatively by analyzing themes extracted from the participants’ discourse. Findings show that the program (a) mobilized teachers from fixed to growth mindsets in regard to their role as educators as reflected in a significant increase in teachers’ beliefs that basic brain abilities are malleable (as extracted from the concept maps, p = 0.004), (b) offered them initial experiences of mindfulness, and (c) possibly opened them to consider more direct approaches to mindfulness practice that are offered in mindfulness-based interventions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.

AB  - All actions are result of scenarios. While we analyze different information pieces and their relationships, we notice that actions drive intents and intents drive actions. These relationships among intents and actions can decode the reasoning behind action selection. In the similar way, in stories, news and even email exchanges these relationships are evident. These relationships can allow us to formulate a sequence of mails irrespective of change in subject and matter. The continuity among concepts, drift of concepts, and then reestablishing of original concepts in conversation, email exchanges, or even series of events is necessary to establish relationships among various artifacts. This paper proposes a multi-edge fuzzy graph-based adversarial concept mapping to resolve this issue. Instead of peaks, this technique tries to map different valleys in concept flow. The transition index between prominent valleys helps to decide your order of that particular leg. The paper further proposes a technique to minimize this using fuzzy graph. The fuzziness in graph represents the fuzzy relationships among concepts. The association among multiple such graphs helps to represent the overall concept flow. The dynamic concept flow represents the overall concept flow across the documents. This algorithm and representation can be very useful to represent lengthy documents with multiple references. This approach can be used to solve many real-life problems like news compilation, legal case relevance detection, and associating assorted news from the period under purview. © 2019, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.

We engaged a diverse national sample of stakeholder experts to generate and then synthesize a comprehensive list of health outcomes for CMC. METHODS: With national snowball sampling of CMC caregiver, advocate, provider, researcher, and policy or health systems experts, we identified 182 invitees for group concept mapping (GCM), a rigorous mixed-methods approach. Respondents (n = 125) first completed Internet-based idea generation by providing unlimited short, free-Text responses to the focus prompt, "A healthy life for a child or youth with medical complexity includes: ." The resulting 707 statements were reduced to 77 unique ideas. Participants sorted the ideas into clusters based on conceptual similarity and rated items on perceived importance and measurement feasibility. Responses were analyzed and mapped via GCM software. RESULTS: The cluster map best fitting the data had 10 outcome domains: (1) basic needs, (2) inclusive education, (3) child social integration, (4) current child health-related quality of life, (5) long-Term child and family self-sufficiency, (6) family social integration, (7) community system supports, (8) health care system supports, (9) a high-quality patientcentered medical home, and (10) family-centered care. Seventeen outcomes representing 8 of the 10 domains were rated as both important and feasible to measure ("go zone"). CONCLUSIONS: GCM identified a rich set of CMC outcome domains. Go-zone items provide an opportunity to test and implement measures that align with a broad view of health for CMC and potentially all children.

AB  - Learner-centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health-profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long-term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case-based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension-based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health-professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:343–353, 2018. © 2018 The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology

AB  - This paper describes the design and implementation of an assessment inspired by Papert’s approach to learning. The assessment is part of a course unit called Digital Making and Learning on a masters programme in Education aimed at students with a predominantly social sciences background. The design of the assessment as part of this course is fundamentally based on Papert’s work, and maintains a ‘mathetic’ approach, focusing on the process of learning rather than a transfer of knowledge and competencies. In order to do this, an online collaborative concept-mapping tool with history-tracking functionality is adopted. The paper describes the social theory lens that informs the entire course and associated assessment design. The practical implementation of the course and how the assessment task functions as part of this learning design is explained, and finally some early evidence for the efficacy of the assessment is discussed. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS). © 2019 National Association of Biology Teachers.

AB  - Background Local implementation of guidelines for pneumonia care is strongly recommended, but the context of care that affects implementation is poorly understood. In a learning health care system, computerized clinical decision support (CDS) provides an opportunity to both improve and track practice, providing insights into the implementation process. Objectives This article examines physician interactions with a CDS to identify reasons for rejection of guideline recommendations. Methods We implemented a multicenter bedside CDS for the emergency department management of pneumonia that integrated patient data with guideline-based recommendations. We examined the frequency of adoption versus rejection of recommendations for site-of-care and antibiotic selection. We analyzed free-text responses provided by physicians explaining their clinical reasoning for rejection, using concept mapping and thematic analysis. Results Among 1,722 patient episodes, physicians rejected recommendations to send a patient home in 24%, leaving text in 53%; reasons for rejection of the recommendations included additional or alternative diagnoses beyond pneumonia, and comorbidities or signs of physiologic derangement contributing to risk of outpatient failure that were not processed by the CDS. Physicians rejected broad-spectrum antibiotic recommendations in 10%, leaving text in 76%; differences in pathogen risk assessment, additional patient information, concern about antibiotic properties, and admitting physician preferences were given as reasons for rejection. Conclusion While adoption of CDS recommendations for pneumonia was high, physicians rejecting recommendations frequently provided feedback, reporting alternative diagnoses, additional individual patient characteristics, and provider preferences as major reasons for rejection. CDS that collects user feedback is feasible and can contribute to a learning health system. © 2019 Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart · New York

AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students’ understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - In K-12 education in the USA, teachers are typically trained to work in content area silos. This structure shapes how teacher certification is organized as well. Biology, chemistry, economics, and urban planning are each considered distinct disciplines. Although there are some benefits to this approach in terms of focus and scope, there are also limits. Deeply integrated topics such as water resilience require a more unified and interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. This paper describes work done to train new science teachers to utilize systems and network models through the use of concept mapping to reconstruct their thinking and understanding of such topics. These teachers were then asked to create appropriate unit and lesson plans that reflected these system and network models. Preliminary findings suggest that educators who participated in this training were better able to teach deeply integrated topics to their K-12 students in more meaningful and productive ways. © 2018, AESS.

AB  - It has been reported that students easily have misconceptions about planets in the solar system because it is hard to imagine the phenomena of outer space. Virtual reality (VR) technology has drawn much attention to virtualizing the scenes in space. However, it is important to help students learn systematically when they learn Astronomy courses in a VR learning environment. Therefore, in this study, a knowledge constructing tool - a concept map to be used as an instant feedback mechanism in a VR system in Astronomy courses - has been developed. Students learn the features and concepts in a VR environment and are guided by an expert concept map. When a student has a misconception, the system will guide him/her to observe the target planet and answer the question again. It is our aim that the proposed approach will enhance students' learning achievement and learning motivation, and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students' learning behavior will be analyzed to understand the effectiveness of this learning approach. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Purpose: This paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review. Design/methodology/approach: A case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability. Findings: Before and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach. Research limitations/implications: Modules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students. Practical implications: By offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making. Social implications: The module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration. Originality/value: This module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.

AB  - This paper presents innovations to stimulate the autonomy of engineering students by using different active methodologies. The strategies designed to address this problem are based on analyzing students' learning styles and incorporating specific tools into teaching practice, such as 'M-eRoDes,' which supports the automatic evaluation and feedback of concept maps created by them. Among the main findings, the students' assessment of the activity 'making concept maps' stands out as useful but not easy. Despite the difficulty, or precisely for that reason, the experience has contributed to improve their autonomy and to develop skills to express the knowledge they have learned. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The goal of care mapping in the clinical setting in undergraduate nursing education is to determine the student's ability to collect, present, and connect relevant data points in order to evaluate and understand the medical plan of care and to develop a priority based nursing plan of care. This same process can be utilized across all health science education programs. The purpose of this chapter is to share how the author has modified the traditional concept map tool to a more user friendly format and to present a process of implementation that may be used in the clinical setting as part of any undergraduate health science program. The benefits of such an implementation are that of more enriched learning to include the development of critical thinking skills, the use of a common sense approach, and the recognition of the patient as a holistic being. © 2018, IGI Global.

AB  - Purpose: To investigate the implementation of Multiple Intelligences (MI) combined with map concept and portfolio assessment to improve classroom atmosphere and nutrition students' performance in learning nutrition care process (NCP). Methods: An individual action research project was implemented in the subject of basic dietetics involving 51 undergraduate nutrition students at the Department of Nutrition Science, Faculty of Health Science Universitas Muhammadiyah Surakarta, Indonesia. Results: Findings indicated that all students enjoyed the lectures; about 91% of them actively participated in the class; and more than half of the students were found to be more creative in completing the dietetics tasks. The assumption of most students that the subject of dietetics is scourge and difficult, turned into an exciting, relaxed but serious and easy to understand tasks, because students could learn using their own intelligence. The map concept and portfolio assessment trained students to be more thorough and disciplined in doing NCP. The average score of students' achievements at the end of semester indicated a very satisfactory category. © 2018 The authors and IJLTER.ORG. All rights reserved.

AB  - There has been little attention given to teaching beliefs of graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), even though they represent the primary teaching workforce for undergraduate students in discussion and laboratory sections at many research universities. Secondary school education studies have shown that teaching beliefs are malleable and can be shaped by professional development, particularly for inexperienced teachers. This study characterized inexperienced GTAs’ teaching beliefs about student learning and how they change with a science-specific pedagogy course that emphasized student learning. GTA teaching beliefs were characterized as traditional (providing information to students), instructive (providing activities for students), and transitional (focusing on student-teacher relationships). At the start of the course, traditional, instructive, and transitional beliefs were emphasized comparably in the concept maps and presentations of inexperienced GTAs. At the end of the course, although GTAs’ beliefs remained mostly teacher focused, they were more instructive than traditional or transitional. GTAs included teaching strategies and jargon from the course in their concept maps but provided minimal explanations about how opportunities for active student engagement would impact student learning. These results suggest there is a need to provide ongoing discipline-specific professional development to inexperienced GTAs as they develop and strengthen their teaching beliefs about student learning. © 2019 S.

AB  - The use of external representations has a potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially in hypothesis generation and scientific reasoning, which are typical difficulties encountered by students. This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three-dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group-based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open-ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This study proposes a web-based system to generate personalized learning paths for IEEE floating-point learners based on a concept map. The proposed system follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) web framework to optimize the architecture using Java solutions. This study is mainly discussed with two parts: a technical part and an educational part. The technical part describes the web architecture and the information technologies used to develop the proposed system. The educational part explains the generation of personalized learning paths for individual learners according to a concept map covering the learning topics of the IEEE floating-point standard. Practically, the proposed system can be employed as a remedial learning system for IEEE floating-point learners. © 2018 IEEE.

AB  - Objective: To study the effect on patient cohorts of mapping condition (diagnosis) codes from source billing vocabularies to a clinical vocabulary. Materials and Methods: Nine International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM) concept sets were extracted from eMERGE network phenotypes, translated to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms concept sets, and applied to patient data that were mapped from source ICD9-CM and ICD10-CM codes to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms codes using Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) vocabulary mappings. The original ICD9-CM concept set and a concept set extended to ICD10-CM were used to create patient cohorts that served as gold standards. Results: Four phenotype concept sets were able to be translated to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms without ambiguities and were able to perform perfectly with respect to the gold standards. The other 5 lost performance when 2 or more ICD9-CM or ICD10-CM codes mapped to the same Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms code. The patient cohorts had a total error (false positive and false negative) of up to 0.15% compared to querying ICD9-CM source data and up to 0.26% compared to querying ICD9-CM and ICD10-CM data. Knowledge engineering was required to produce that performance; simple automated methods to generate concept sets had errors up to 10% (one outlier at 250%). Discussion: The translation of data from source vocabularies to Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT) resulted in very small error rates that were an order of magnitude smaller than other error sources. Conclusion: It appears possible to map diagnoses from disparate vocabularies to a single clinical vocabulary and carry out research using a single set of definitions, thus improving efficiency and transportability of research. © The Author(s) 2018.

AB  - Introduction: Medical education today, encourages modification of traditional didactic lectures with innovations to promote active learning strategies to enhance integration of knowledge and critical thinking skills among students. Learning independently is challenging in year 1 of the undergraduate medical curriculum. However, defining the learning goals clearly by the instructor to the students will make them appreciate it and mould them into successful learners with deep approach. Aim: To enhance self-directed learning skills and to promote concept mapping ability to integrate the study of various metabolic functions and fundamental concepts in biochemistry. Materials and Methods: First year MBBS Student volunteers (n=127) in their second semester having an experience of over 30 weeks of learning biochemistry in an integrated system-wise approach were involved in this study. They were exposed to a self-directed active learning strategy for a period of 10 weeks, for linking important biochemical terms from the current learning objectives to various concepts and topics learnt earlier in the year. Student’s perspective regarding the above activity was documented by obtaining their responses in a closed ended questionnaire using Likert scale and was expressed as percentage. Results: Majority of the students (n=100, 79%) opined that it was a unique way of learning biochemistry and that they (n=111, 87%) were required to read up previous portions. Many students (n=100, 79%) felt that it made them more than mere rote learners and were able to integrate biochemistry topics more efficiently (n=109, 86%). Many students also felt that it helped them to improve their test scores (n=79, 62%). Conclusion: Active participation in the current study has made them learn the concept building skills in biochemistry and has proved to be an effective exercise of revisit to topics learnt throughout the year. Innovative curriculum delivery strategies should be designed to teach preclinical subjects in a medical school so that they shall infuse integrated learning approach in students. Concept building activities in a lecture set up shall generate curiosity in the process of learning and transform students into deep approach learners. © 2018, Journal of Clinical and Diagnostic Research.

AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n = 245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert’s referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners’ productions. © 2018, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Purpose To evaluate student perceptions of collaborative concept mapping exercises in an image acquisition and technical evaluation course. Methods First-year radiologic technology students worked collaboratively throughout the semester to create concept maps for receptor exposure, contrast, spatial resolution, and distortion. They completed a survey at the end of the course that detailed whether the maps were helpful for learning and understanding the content. Results The majority (90%) of the student participants responded favorably to the concept mapping activity, saying the maps were helpful for learning how certain technical factors affect image quality. In addition, 85% of the participants thought concept maps should be used in future radiologic technology courses. Discussion Although this pilot study was limited by its small sample size, students' favorable results suggest that concept mapping is a valuable instructional tool in helping students learn image evaluation principles and therefore warrants a larger-scale investigation. Conclusion Additional research is warranted to address the use of concept maps in other radiologic science content areas. © 2018 American Society of Radiologic Technologists.

AB  - An online course on Oscillation and Wave Physics (https://ocw.upc.edu/webs/42254/Acustica_EN/) was implemented. As the first objective, this article describes its main features, especially the two types of indexes for accessing the different items (a traditional linear index, and a hypertextual index based on a concept map). The second objective is to describe the students’ response to the one index in comparison to the other. As a qualitative response (perception), obtained from the students’ free comments, some advantages of the hypertextual index were found, for example, the ability to raise curiosity about physics contents, or the building of a convenient attitude for learning autonomously. Some drawbacks perceived, which are put into perspective, were the possible equivocal interpretation of the guiding questions, or the uncertainty about following the optimal order of items. As a quantitative response (performance in exams), a small but significant difference was found only for two subtopics related to cross-linked relationships between different conceptual aspects. This can be explained by a deeper internalization of these relationships through the concept map underlying the hypertextual index. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Resting-state networks (RSNs) and functional connectivity (FC) have been increasingly exploited for mapping brain activity and identifying abnormalities in pathologies, including epilepsy. The majority of studies currently available are based on bloodoxygenation- level-dependent (BOLD) contrast in combination with either independent component analysis (ICA) or pairwise region of interest (ROI) correlations. Despite its success, this approach has several shortcomings as BOLD is only an indirect and non-quantitative measure of brain activity. Conversely, promising results have recently been achieved by arterial spin labeling (ASL) MRI, primarily developed to quantify brain perfusion. However, the wide application of ASL-based FC has been hampered by its complexity and relatively low robustness to noise, leaving several aspects of this approach still largely unexplored. In this study, we firstly aimed at evaluating the effect of noise reduction on spatio-temporal ASL analyses and quantifying the impact of two ad-hoc processing pipelines (basic and advanced) on connectivity measures. Once the optimal strategy had been defined, we investigated the applicability of ASL for connectivity mapping in patients with drug-resistant temporal epilepsy vs. controls (10 per group), aiming at revealing between-group voxel-wise differences in each RSN and ROI-wise FC changes. We first found ASL was able to identify the main network (DMN) along with all the others generally detected with BOLD but never previously reported from ASL. For all RSNs, ICA-based denoising (advanced pipeline) allowed to increase their similarity with the corresponding BOLD template. ASL-based RSNs were visibly consistent with literature findings; however, group differences could be identified in the structure of some networks. Indeed, statistics revealed areas of significant FC decrease in patients within different RSNs, such as DMN and cerebellum (CER), while significant increases were found in some cases, such as the visual networks. Finally, the ROI-based analyses identified several inter-hemispheric dysfunctional links (controls > patients) mainly between areas belonging to the DMN, right-left thalamus and right-left temporal lobe. Conversely, fewer connections, predominantly intra-hemispheric, showed the opposite pattern (controls < patients). All these elements provide novel insights into the pathological modulations characterizing a “network disease" as epilepsy, shading light on the importance of perfusion-based approaches for identifying the disrupted areas and communications between brain regions. © 2019 Boscolo Galazzo, Storti, Barnes, De Blasi, De Vita, Koepp, Duncan, Groves, Pizzini, Menegaz and Fraioli.

AB  - Online learning environments are increasingly used by students and instructors. Cohesion Network Analysis (CNA) can be employed by instructors to analyze discourse structure in terms of cohesive links in order to model student participation and interactions in collaborative learning environments. This paper presents an extended longitudinal analysis together with corresponding visualizations of participation generated for an online math course, powered by CNA. Multiple interactive views centered on the evolution of participation and of interactions between students clustered into three layers are generated using the CNA indices provided by the ReaderBench framework. Two types of sociograms are used to show the interactions between learners in the two course weeks that exhibited extreme conditions, namely: a) week 6, when a dramatic decrease of participation was identified, and b) week 16, when the highest number of participants and contributions were logged. In addition to the views centered on participants, we introduce a heatmap depicting the evolution of keyword relevance over time, as well as a Chord diagram for visualizing concept maps based on semantic relatedness. Our analytics dashboard can be used by tutors to monitor students throughout the term and to better ascertain the correlation of course material, schedule, and deadlines with the participation of students, as well as their interactions among themselves and with the tutor. © ISLS.

AB  - The research assessed secondary school students’ conceptions of acid-base strengths by using the conceptual change instruction accompanied with concept maps and analogies. These teaching strategies were employed to help them make unfamiliar events familiar. Within a quasi-experimental design, the sample of the study consisted of 73 secondary school students. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data. The results showed that the experimental group that took the conceptual change-oriented instruction performed better than the control group. In light of the results, it can be concluded that employing such visuals and interactive materials as concept maps and analogies for achieving conceptual change is effective in generating better understanding of chemistry concepts. © ISSN:1304-6020

AB  - Concept mapping is an important tool used in science learning to help students construct understanding about fundamental concepts and how they are related. The EcoXPT research project has the goal of supporting authentic experiment-based inquiry within an immersive virtual world curriculum for middle school ecosystem science. It builds on prior research with the EcoMUVE curriculum, which includes, as a culminating activity, student teams creating hand-drawn concept maps to represent their hypotheses about the causal relationships in a virtual ecosystem. As part of the initial Design-Based Research phase of EcoXPT, researchers developed a new electronic concept mapping tool which was piloted with the EcoMUVE curriculum. This study looks at differences in concept maps drawn by student teams based on whether they were given access to the new concept-mapping tool. The findings provide insight into the impact of concept map scaffolding choices, and inform the design of future versions of the tool. © 2018

AB  - Kit-Build concept map (KB map) is an automatic framework based on the concept map, which is utilized for sharing understanding in pair discussion as Reciprocal Kit-Build concept map (RKB map). In the preliminary experiment, the participants from RKB group can recognize their partner’s understanding significantly better than the participants who used the traditional concept map (TCM group) and shows the advantages over the traditional concept map in sharing understanding activity. Therefore, the evidences during discussion will be deeply investigated in this paper to examine the cause of these advantages, especially the relationship between type of talk and the changed propositions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

AB  - The authors find justification for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the complex problems that today's students will face as tomorrow's STEM professionals. Teachers with individual subject-area specialties in the STEM content areas have limited experience in integrating STEM. In this study, the authors investigated the conceptual changes of secondary school teachers teaching domain-specific STEM courses after a week-long professional development experience integrating earthquake engineering and domain-specific concepts. They documented and then triangulated outcomes of the experience using participating teachers' concept maps and teacher-generated written materials, respectively. Statistical comparisons of participants' concept maps revealed significant increases in their overall understanding of earthquake engineering and more accurate linkages with and among science domain-specific concepts. Content analyses of teachers' learning products confirmed the concept map analysis and also provided evidence of transfer of workshop learning experiences into teacher-designed curriculum products accurately linking earthquake engineering and domain-specific STEM content knowledge. © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This formative evaluation develops a novel conceptual model for a discipline approach fostering intrinsic motivation and positive relationships in schools. We used concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on kind discipline from teachers, administrators, and other school staff. Three core themes describing kind discipline emerged from 11 identified clusters: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. We mapped the identified components of kind discipline onto a social ecological model and found that kind discipline encompasses all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed. Products of the analysis and synthesis reported here are operationalized materials for teachers grounded in a “be kind” culture code for classrooms. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Through multimedia courseware, knowledge can be presented in a form of hierarchy concept map. In this study, we chose Biology subject as the proof of concept in our experiment. In learning the subject, students were required to imagine, visualize and memorize a lot of facts, shapes, concepts, and processes. They perceived Biology as a difficult and very unexciting subject, thus an assistant tool is required to facilitate them. In achieving that purpose, this study conducted a focus group discussion and interview, select, analyze and design a hierarchy concept map in a teaching and learning module that comprises a prototype application. The effectiveness and usability of the prototype has been evaluated. Based on the results, group A scored comparatively lower as compared to group B in the post-test with the mean score of 61.374 and 85.564 respectively, 24.19% effectiveness compared to conventional method. Respondents' perceptions and behaviors towards the visual representation of the knowledge were also positive. Therefore it can be concluded that a concept map that has been implemented in the courseware helps students to comprehend the lesson content. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today’s global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that “knowledge” does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191–217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals’ attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students’ learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students’ test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This paper describes the development, implementation, and students' perceptions of a new trilayer approach of teaching (TLAT). The TLAT model involved blending lecture, in-class group activities, and out-of-class assignments on selected content areas and was implemented initially in a first-year integrated pharmacy course. Course contents were either delivered by traditional lectures or by the TLAT. A survey instrument was distributed by SurveyMonkey to determine students' perceptions of the TLAT model. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Students' performance in a total of 225 examination and quiz questions was analyzed to evaluate whether the TLAT model improved students' learning. Students' (n = 98) performance scores for TLATbased and lecture-based questions were 83.3 ± 10.2 and 79.5 ± 14.0, respectively (P < 0.05). Ninety-three percent of students believed that in-class group activities enhanced conceptual understanding of course materials, helped them take responsibility of their own learning, and enhanced their overall learning experiences. More than 80% of respondents felt that solving cases and developing concept maps helped them sharpen creative and critical thinking skills. In addition, 90% of the respondents indicated that the homework throughout the semester helped them stay up to date and focused with the progress of the course. The use of the TLAT model led to an improvement in student learning of complex concepts. Moreover, the results suggest that this model improves students' self-reliance and attitudes toward learning. Our findings should serve as an impetus for inclusion of diverse active learning strategies in pharmacy education. © 2017 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - Biomedical word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an important intermediate task in many natural language processing applications such as named entity recognition, syntactic parsing, and relation extraction. In this paper, we employ knowledge-based approaches that also exploit recent advances in neural word/concept embeddings to improve over the state-of-the-art in biomedical WSD using the MSH WSD dataset as the test set. Our methods involve weak supervision - we do not use any hand-labeled examples for WSD to build our prediction models; however, we employ an existing well known named entity recognition and concept mapping program, MetaMap, to obtain our concept vectors. Over the MSH WSD dataset, our linear time (in terms of numbers of senses and words in the test instance) method achieves an accuracy of 92.24% which is an absolute 3% improvement over the best known results obtained via unsupervised or knowledge-based means. A more expensive approach that we developed relies on a nearest neighbor framework and achieves an accuracy of 94.34%, essentially cutting the error rate in half. Employing dense vector representations learned from unlabeled free text has been shown to benefit many language processing tasks recently and our efforts show that biomedical WSD is no exception to this trend. For a complex and rapidly evolving domain such as biomedicine, building labeled datasets for larger sets of ambiguous terms may be impractical. Here, we show that weak supervision that leverages recent advances in representation learning can rival supervised approaches in biomedical WSD. However, external knowledge bases (here sense inventories) play a key role in the improvements achieved. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - In-depth understanding of concepts studied is the main goal of a learning process. One of the alternative assessment tools that could potentially increase students’ level of understanding is through the use of concept maps. Accordingly, the main objective of this research was to examine the effects of using concept maps in assessing the level of students’ understanding of electrolysis through laboratory learning activities. A total of thirty two Form 4 students were involved in the study. The pre and post concept map task that was evaluated using convergence scoring method was the instrument used in this study. The results of the study found that, the level of students’ understanding could significantly be increased due to the use of concept maps as an alternative assessment tool for laboratory learning activities. In-depth understanding bears close relationships with the ability of an individual to have higher-order thinking skills. In addition, the positive feedbacks provided by the students on their ability in using concept maps to assess their understanding in laboratory learning activities were also reported in this study. © 2016 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge management is a significant driver for any enterprise development and evolution as it is engaged with planning, implementing, controlling, monitoring and improving enterprise's processes and systems. However, organisations are still at a disadvantage when applying knowledge management in a real environment. A resourced-based view of knowledge management stimulates the consideration of knowledge management enablers (KMEs) as factors that should be employed during the development and implementation of knowledge management systems. Using organisations' KMEs is critical for understanding how knowledge is created, shared, disseminated and upgraded in order to better respond to the dynamic environment. They are also essential to identify available assets and resources and clarify how an organisation's capabilities are created and utilised. Sustaining these KMEs and applying them in systematic modes and business processes requires a generic overview of these KMEs and the relationship between them. The semantic representation of the KMEs domain can be an attractive approach to meet this demand. Using ontologies facilitates the semantic representation of the KMEs and provides a shared understanding of knowledge among individuals in the organisation. This paper proposes the employment of an abstract KMEs ontology (aKMEOnt) that formally defines an essential pillar of the knowledge management domain. Organisation structure, culture, information technology, leadership, knowledge context and business repository have been selected as representatives to define the KMEs domain. Each of the selected KMEs has a set of concepts that characterises its domain. The whole concept map of these KMEs has been developed to depict the concepts and their relationships in the KMEs domain. Based on the concept map of the KMEs, the aKMEOnt, including its classes and properties is implemented using the Protégé tool and Ontology Web Language-Description Logic (OWL-DL).The aKMEOnt is important to explicitly manage and control the flow of knowledge in the organisation, and, in addition, it can be integrated with potential semantic representation of other related disciplines. © The Authors, 2017.

AB  - Institutions have developed diverse approaches that vary in effectiveness and cost to improve student performance in introductory science, technology, engineering, and mathematics courses. We developed a low-cost, graduate student-led, metacognition-based study skills course taught in conjunction with the introductory biology series at Miami University. Our approach aimed to improve performance for underachieving students by combining an existing framework for the process of learning (the study cycle) with concrete tools (outlines and concept maps) that have been shown to encourage deep understanding. To assess the effectiveness of our efforts, we asked 1) how effective our voluntary recruitment model was at enrolling the target cohort, 2) how the course impacted performance on lecture exams, 3) how the course impacted study habits and techniques, and 4) whether there are particular study habits or techniques that are associated with large improvements on exam scores. Voluntary recruitment attracted only 11-17% of our target cohort. While focal students improved on lecture exams relative to their peers who did not enroll, gains were relatively modest, and not all students improved. Further, although students across both semesters of our study reported improved study habits (based on pre and post surveys) and on outlines and concept maps (based on retrospectively scored assignments), gains were more dramatic in the Fall semester. Multivariate models revealed that, while changes in study habits and in the quality of outlines and concept maps were weakly associated with change in performance on lecture exams, relationships were only significant in the Fall semester and were sometimes counterintuitive. Although benefits of the course were offset somewhat by the inefficiency of voluntary recruitment, we demonstrate the effectiveness our course, which is inexpensive to implement and has advantage of providing pedagogical experience to future educators. © 2017 T.

AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions: (a) "How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?", and (b) "Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?" Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students' interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students' school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students' level of interdisciplinary understanding of science. © 2018 Hong Kong Bao Long Accounting And Secretarial Limited.

AB  - Four graphs for personalized study planning constitute the personalized study planning framework, namely, a graph representing a conceptual structure of study program; a graph representing study course; a graph visualizing each topic of study course using concept map; a graph representing learning objects. This paper deals with the third graph - a graph displaying study course topic structure and knowledge assessment. Authors describe concept map based knowledge evaluation system integration possibilities with personalized study planning prototype and usage in personal study planning. In order to perform the structure analysis of the concept maps authors propose to use of the methods of structure analysis to calculate the ranks for the nodes of the graphs thus detecting the most significant nodes in the graph structure. The calculation of ranks for the graph nodes allows detecting the most essential concepts in the concept map. © 2017 The Authors.

AB  - This paper considers the origins and development of the concept mapping methodology, a summary of its growth, and its influence in a variety of fields. From initial discussions with graduate students, through the rise of the theory-driven approach to program evaluation and the development of a theoretical framework for conceptualization methodology, the paper highlights some of the key early efforts and pilot projects that culminated in a 1989 special issue on the method in Evaluation and Program Planning that brought the method to the attention of the field of evaluation. The paper details the thinking that led to the standard version of the method (the analytic sequence, “bridging” index, and pattern matching) and the development of the software for accomplishing it. A bibliometric analysis shows that the rate of citation continues to increase, where it has grown geographically and institutionally, that the method has been used in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and that the literature had an influence on the field. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of some of the key aspects of the approach that warrant further development. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - In this study, we investigated the value of a concept map marking guide as an alternative formative assessment tool for science teachers to adopt for the topic of energy. Eight high school science teachers marked students’ concept maps using an itemized holistic marking guide. Their marking was compared with the researchers’ marking and the scores of a multiple-choice diagnostic test. Statistical analysis revealed that teachers evaluated students’ concept maps consistently, but the concept map scores were only mildly correlated with the multiple-choice test scores. We explored what each assessment method revealed in terms of students’ understanding with one student’s performance as a showcase. Teachers’ views on using the marking guide of concept maps as an assessment tool were also included. We discuss the value of the concept map marking guide as a formative assessment tool for science teachers to create and modify in order to encourage students’ conceptual learning. © 2017 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Teachers need an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to enable them to incorporate NOS into their teaching of science. The current study examines the usefulness of a strategy for challenging or changing teachers’ understandings of NOS. The teachers who participated in this study were 10 initial teacher education chemistry students and six experienced teachers from secondary and primary schools who were introduced to an explicit and reflective activity, a dramatic reading about a historical scientific development. Concept maps were used before and after the activity to assess teachers’ knowledge of NOS. The participants also took part in a focus group interview to establish whether they perceived the activity as useful in developing their own understanding of NOS. Initial analysis led us to ask another group, comprising seven initial teacher education chemistry students, to take part in a modified study. These participants not only completed the same tasks as the previous participants but also completed a written reflection commenting on whether the activity and focus group discussion enhanced their understanding of NOS. Both Lederman et al.’s (Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 39(6), 497–521, 2002) concepts of NOS and notions of “naive” and “informed” understandings of NOS and Hay’s (Studies in Higher Education, 32(1), 39–57, 2007) notions of “surface” and “deep” learning were used as frameworks to examine the participants’ specific understandings of NOS and the depth of their learning. The ways in which participants’ understandings of NOS were broadened or changed by taking part in the dramatic reading are presented. The impact of the data-gathering tools on the participants’ professional learning is also discussed. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - People who claim that applying Novakian concept maps in Turkish is problematic base their arguments largely upon the structural differences between the English and Turkish languages. This study aims to introduce the indexing method to eliminate problems encountered in Turkish applications of Novakian maps and to share the preliminary results of its application. For this purpose, 20 pre-service chemistry teachers who had mastered the concept-mapping method after seven weeks of intense education were asked to prepare concept maps on the topic of atoms by using both the Novakian and indexing methods. The maps were qualitatively assessed by experts regarding informational content. The participants were asked to state in writing their opinions about the indexing method. The resulting analysis revealed that the participants were able to express the relation between two concepts more realistically when they used the indexing method, and the resulting maps were much richer in informational content. Almost all participants (95%) stated that the new method was more convenient in terms of reflecting the necessary mental information. The results of the study show the indexing method to be a much more convenient and informative way of preparing concept maps for both teachers and students. © 2016 EDAM.

AB  - Context: concept Maps (CMs) enable the creation of a schematic representation of a domain knowledge. For this reason, CMs have been applied in different research areas, including Computer Science. Objective: the objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study conducted to collect and evaluate existing research on CMs initiatives in Computer Science. Method: the mapping study was performed by searching five electronic databases. We also performed backward snowballing and manual search to find publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies. Results: from the mapping study, we identified 108 studies addressing CMs initiatives in different subareas of Computer Science that were reviewed to extract relevant information to answer a set of research questions. The mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in recent years and it has been extensively investigated due to support in teaching and learning. Conclusions: based on our results we conclude that the use of CMs as an educational tool has been widely accepted in Computer Science. © 2017 Vilnius University.

AB  - The aim of the present research was to compare two methodological tools with two groups of pre-university secondary education students (17-18 years old). The experimental group worked constructing concept maps using the jigsaw technique (experimental teaching approach, ETA) on the topic of radioactivity in five sessions of their physics course. The control group worked on the same subject in a traditional teaching method (lecture-based teaching approach, LTA). The research design was quasi-experimental, with 28 students of a school in Extremadura (Spain). The results of a pre-test and a post-test were compared for the two groups. The working hypotheses were: (a) students who work collaboratively in constructing concept maps using the jigsaw technique perform better in learning the topic of radioactivity; and (b) this method fosters a positive attitude of the students towards how the topic is taught. With respect to Hypothesis (a), the results appeared to show an improvement in learning in the experimental group, although without reaching statistical significance. Neither were there any statistically significant differences between the post-test results of the two groups. With respect to Hypothesis (b), most of the experimental group students found the method to be very encouraging; despite the insecurity they felt with something new that they were not used to. The experimental group's pre-test and post-test results were strongly correlated (r=0.707), so that the ETA can be regarded as fairly effective since the students learnt more meaningfully and with less effort.

AB  - This study used a between-subjects experimental design to examine the effects of three different computer-based instructional strategies (concept map, refutation text, and expository scientific text) on science learning. Concept maps are node-link diagrams that show concepts as nodes and relationships among the concepts as labeled links. Refutational texts are designed specifically to elicit common misconceptions that learners typically hold about a particular topic, directly refute the misconceptions, and present scientific explanations as compelling alternatives. Expository scientific texts consist of texts that are written specifically to present correct scientific information. Sixty-seven participants were randomly assigned to study one of three computer-based presentations on climate change. The dependent measures were tests of free recall and transfer. The concept map group significantly outperformed the refutational and scientific text groups on both free recall and transfer tests. Practical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - Teachers make a difference for the outcome of their students in science classrooms. One focus in this context lies on teachers’ professional knowledge. We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students’ performance in science. Students’ science performance was conceptualised by system thinking performance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students’ performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students’ performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers’ PCK and students’ performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students’ performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers’ content-related professional knowledge and students’ learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - In order to enhance healthcare students’ conceptual understanding and assessment of their learning and also to foster their metacognitive development, we fully integrated concept mapping into a radiographic physics course. Mapping assisted instructors to administer assessment of students’ conceptual knowledge and assessment for the improvement of concept instruction. Furthermore, learners were invited to incorporate mapping-based self-assessment as a metacognitive strategy into their learning. To encourage learners to do so, peer exchange of feedback was also arranged. Based on analyses of learners’ maps, self-reflections, and interview data, both evidence of students’ learning and lessons learned from this implementation are provided. © 2017, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

A quasi-experimental approach was applied to a sample of 85 9th grade students. Class instruction lasted for five weeks, with two classes each week. Using the quasi-experimental research approach, 27 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM), 28 students were assigned to a group that received individual computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) assisted instruction, and 30 students were assigned to a group that received collaborative computer-based concept mapping (CCBCM) assisted instruction. We explored the impact of these methods of instruction on students' memorization, understanding, and application of concepts and on their higher order cognitive ability. The findings revealed that the CCBCM and CBCM groups scored better than the NCM group on the post-test. On the retention test, the CCBCM group outperformed the NCM group on all subtests. © 2017 Authors.

AB  - The Environmental Education, believing on the break-up the unsustainable ways of being and doing in the world, on valuing natural diversity and community, on democratizing knowledge and making decisions for and with the collective, requires pedagogical practice that allow the action of the subjects involved, with space for their previous understandings, proposition of actions and systemic understanding. In this work we make theoretical considerations about the Methodology of Trees and the concept maps as paths that integrate and articulate the pedagogical doing in Environmental Education. The Methodology of Trees contributes to understanding the environment, identifying conflicts and planning related actions with sustainability. Concept maps favor the understanding of complex issues, the identification of concepts and contents, as well as their interrelationships through a systemic approach. The combination of these ways contributes so that the pedagogical practice in Environmental Education is based on collective dialogue and knowledge, contextualized, interdisciplinary and meaningful. © 2018, Foundation Journal of Science Education.

AB  - Given that parents are the main carriers of change in their child, their participation in programs for preventing behavior problems in early childhood represents a key element in ensuring the success of the intervention. That said, although at-risk families benefit the most from this type of program, they are identified as being hard to reach. This study aims at identifying the factors that influence parent recruitment based on the points of view of the actors concerned. To this end, a concept mapping operation was performed, which involved parents (n = 19), practitioners (n = 19), and administrators (n = 13) from community and public organizations. The participants generated 131 statements to complete the following sentence: In your opinion, parents would enroll more in prevention activities for their child if…. These 131 statements were classified into 12 groups representing the factors that influence parent recruitment, all of which were considered relatively important (between 3.51 and 4.42 on 5). The participants also agree on an understanding of recruitment that tends toward an ecological model. This study shows that parent recruitment into prevention programs targeting behavior problems in early childhood is complex and multifactorial (including factors that concern parents, practitioners, services, organizations, and policies). Because the map shows that the influencing factors in recruitment appear to be interrelated, they should all be considered to increase the chances of reaching at-risk families. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Nowadays a new yet powerful tool for drug repurposing and hypothesis generation emerged. Text mining of different domains like scientific libraries or social media has proven to be reliable in that application. One particular task in that area is medical concept normalization, i.e. mapping a disease mention to a concept in a controlled vocabulary, like Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). This task is challenging due to the differences in language of health care professionals and social media users. To bridge this gap, we developed end-to-end architectures based on bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units. In addition, we combined an attention mechanism with our model. We have done an exploratory study on hyperparameters of proposed architectures and compared them with the effective baseline for classification based on convolutional neural networks. A qualitative examination of the mentions in user reviews dataset collected from popular online health information platforms as well as quantitative one both show improvements in the semantic representation of health-related expressions in user reviews about drugs. © 2018 Rossiiskii Gosudarstvennyi Gumanitarnyi Universitet.All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Complex systems are often challenging subjects, because they are characterized by many elusive and non-intuitive elements (emergence, multilevel organization, interconnections, heterogeneous components and invisible dynamic processes) that can be difficult for teachers to explain and for students to perceive. This chapter offers several principles for overcoming this challenge. First, it is important to present the human body within a conceptual framework that addresses, expresses and organizes all of the system's components and the relationships between them. Second, students should be given a means of externalizing and examining their own mental system models, such as concept maps. Third, students can benefit greatly from explicit guidance in using systems language and in drawing clear connections between the various aspects of the complex system. This can take the form of a metacognitive reflective interview-a knowledge integration activity that helps students reflect on their own concept maps and make fuller use of systems language through a series of explicit, specially designed questions. Finally, teachers should be provided with learning materials that explicitly reinforce the connections between the system's different hierarchical organizational levels and the connections between the human body's various sub-systems. The chapter will present examples of how these four principles can be applied and explore their direct contribution to the promotion of students' systems thinking.]. © 2018 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This mixed research, is a snapshot of some Filipino Biology teachers' knowledge structure and how their concepts of the five topics in Biology (Photosynthesis, Cellular Respiration, human reproductive system, Mendelian genetics and NonMendelian genetics) functions and develops inside a biology classroom. The study focuses on the six biology teachers and a total of 222 students in their respective classes. Of the Six (6) teachers, three (3) are under the Science curriculum and the other three (3) are under regular curriculum in both public and private schools in Iligan city and Lanao del Norte, Philippines. The study utilized classroom discourses, concept maps, interpretative case-study method, bracketing method, and concept analysis for qualitative part; the quantitative part uses a nonparametric statistical tool, Kendall's tau Coefficient for determining relationship and congruency while measures of central tendencies and dispersion (mean, and standard deviation) for concept maps scores interpretation. Knowledge Base of Biology teachers were evaluated by experts in field of specialization having a doctorate program (e.g. PhD in Genetics) and PhD Biology candidates. The data collection entailed seven (7) months immersion: one (1) month for preliminary phase for the researcher to gain teachers' and students' confidence and the succeeding six (6) months for main observation and data collection. The evaluation of teachers' knowledge base by experts indicated that teachers' knowledge of (65%) is lower than the minimum (75%) recommended by ABD-el-Khalick and Boujaoude (1997). Thus, the experts believe that content knowledge of the teachers is hardly adequate for their teaching assignment. Moreover, the teachers in this study do not systematically use reallife situation to apply the concepts they teach. They can identify concepts too abstract for their student; however, they seldom use innovative ways to bring the discussion to their students' level of readiness and capacity to learn. Kendall's Tau Coefficient of agreement indicated that there is an agreement of the rating by experts and PhD (Biology) candidates. As for recommended level for teaching based on the respondent content knowledge structure, the experts and the PhD (Biology) candidates agree that the content knowledge of the teachers is at the borderline (rating of 6) between elementary and high school. These results imply that biology teachers need in-service training to upgrade their content knowledge in the subject. At the same time, the pre-service curriculum for biology teachers needs upgrading. © 2018 Author(s).

AB  - This paper reports a study into the development of staff understanding of assessment and assessment practice. Eight teachers from two universities constructed an initial concept map about assessment that was discussed in a one-to-one semi-structured interview. A year later, a new map was created and the interview focused on change in thinking and practice. Multiple models of assessment were evident in the participants’ understandings at the same time and change was characterised by subtle evolution in thinking. Development in practice was more significant and often associated with the foregrounding of assessment for learning. Vignettes are used to illustrate the variation in nature and scale of development. Interplay between this development of practice and understanding was multidirectional and external context played an important role. The approach offers detailed insight into the relationship between assessment thinking and practice and demonstrates that both research and academic development need to go beyond conventional approaches to conceptualising the development of academics and take account of the finer grained complexities of assessment thinking and practices. © 2017 HERDSA.

AB  - This work presents a proposal for the teaching-learning of the concept map technique applied to the Natural Sciences course in the second year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO, according to its initials in Spanish). Two sessions have been designed, one of which is an instructor-led session to learn the technique and another is a session in which the students independently create a concept map, applying what they have learned in the previous session. To determine the effectiveness of the proposal, the concept maps created by the students during the two sessions have been evaluated, the grades obtained on the assessment tests for the unit before the concept map experience have been compared to those obtained on the assessment tests for the unit carried out using this technique, and a survey was written to find out the level of student satisfaction with the training received and the usefulness of the concept map technique. The results show that more than 65% of students earned grades between 7 and 9.5 on the concept maps created independently during the two academic years in which the proposal has been implemented. The study carried out allows us to conclude that the students have learned how to create concept maps, and evidences the usefulness of the methodology used and the need to implement more sessions for the creation of concept maps in the Natural Sciences course so that this technique is transformed into a learning strategy. The students have expressed a high level of satisfaction with the training received and the tool they have learned how to use.

AB  - We recently transformed a traditional introductory biology course into an active learning experience that resonates with a wide range of undergraduate students. Backward course design led to an innovative curriculum that (1) is based on biology's big ideas, (2) has measurable learning outcomes, and (3) encourages development of higher order thinking skills. Our studio classroom design maximizes interactions; cantilevered workstations distributed throughout the room encourage student-instructor and student-student interactions. Group discussions occur at whiteboards as students solve problems, create concept maps, plan experiments and interpret experimental data. Workstation computers and dual monitors support whole-class instruction as well as student-led group explorations. The classroom design meets the traditional needs of a biology lab, including access to sinks, use of compound microscopes, data acquisition, gel electrophoresis and thermal cyclers. This creative new learning space supports a constructivist approach to learning, moving student conversations past rote repetition of textbook material to evaluation and synthesis of ideas, as well as dialogue about how science generates new information and the interface between biology and engineering. In the interest of helping others along their path toward implementing active learning in their classrooms, we share a description of our course transformation and important lessons learned in the process. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

AB  - This research aims to develop oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) teaching material used the Four Steps Teaching Material Development (4S TMD) method consists of four steps: selection, structuring, characterization and didactical reduction. This paper is the first part of the development of teaching material that includes selection and structuring steps. At the selection step, the development of teaching material begins with the development concept of redox based on curriculum demands, then the development of fundamental concepts sourced from the international textbook, and last is the development of values or skills can be integrated with redox concepts. The results of this selection step are the subject matter of the redox concept and values can be integrated with it. In the structuring step was developed concept map that provide on the relationship between redox concepts; Macro structure that guide systematic on the writing of teaching material; And multiple representations which are the development of teaching material that connection between macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic level representations. The result of the two steps in this first part of the study produced a draft of teaching material. Evaluation of the draft of teaching material is done by an expert lecturer in the field of chemical education to assess the feasibility of teaching material. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students' understandings of particle physics. Fifty-nine year 12 (16- and 17 year-old) students from two London schools participated. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were instructed how to make a concept map and were provided with 24 topic-specific key words. Students' concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions they represented, enumerating how many students had made each one, and by identifying errors and potential misconceptions, with reference to the specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by a majority of students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although there was evidence that some students were unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks. © 2016 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A new undergraduate course on deep learning is described. Most of the students who took the course were junior and senior computer science majors. Nearly all the students in the course had not had a previous course in machine learning. The course builds on basic concepts students learn in calculus, statistics and probability courses. Key concepts from machine learning, e.g. the cardinal sin of over-fitting, are introduced in the context of deep learning, in a problem driven manner, so that students discover and observe these concepts for themselves. A concept map as well as useful online resources are described in the appendix. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2017.

AB  - Background: The Ebola virus epidemic and civil war in Liberia left the country in need of strengthening the health workforce. E-learning in medical education provides relevant learning opportunities for students, develops faculty competencies, and assists with the retention of healthcare workers. The Stellenbosch University Rural Medical Education Partnership Initiative (SURMEPI), the College of Health and Life Sciences (COHLS) at the University of Liberia (UL), and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) formed a partnership to create an e-learning solution for the COHLS. Objective: This article outlines the implementation of an e-learning solution for the COHLS in Monrovia, and describes the challenges met, the key successes achieved, and the lessons learnt. Methods: An initial scoping visit to Liberia was followed by three further on-site visits. Problems identified were: very limited or no network and computer resources, no internet connection, intermittent power, and lack of IT skills. We followed an evolutionary approach to infrastructure implementation by trying various solutions before settling on an offsite-hosted solution using Software as a Service (SaaS). Local staff were upskilled to administer this while remote support from Stellenbosch IT was provided. A stable internet connection was established. Staff and students can access the Learning Management System (LMS) 24/7 using mobile devices and laptops. Workshops were held where staff were taught how to produce online teaching material. Each class has at least one teaching assistant to assist lecturers with uploading and indexing material on the LMS. A benchmarking visit by COHLS faculty to Stellenbosch University took place, during which an e-learning strategic plan was drawn up. Further online workshops were conducted, and teaching materials were placed on the new LMS. Outcomes: The intranet that was established consisted of internet connection and software as a service in the form of Office 365, providing access to several products and services. The e-learning model attended to technology and human resources simultaneously. The e-learning strategy aimed to improve teaching and learning at the COHLS, boost the number of qualified doctors, reduce the workload on lecturers, and be scalable in the future. Conclusion: It is challenging to implement e-learning in medical education. Inadequate infrastructure, limited bandwidth, lack of skilled IT staff, unreliable power supply, time commitment, and ongoing maintenance all need to be overcome. The creation of an e-learning solution for the COHLS over a period of 15 months was enabled by the common vision and close collaboration of the three partners. This model can potentially be replicated across other faculties in the University of Liberia and other educational institutions in Liberia. © 2018 The Author(s).

AB  - Open educational resources (OERs) are a recent trend in higher education. With an Internet connection and a computing device, students can utilize OERs anytime-anywhere as primary or supplementary resources for learning. OERs and other free materials eliminate a major barrier to student learning: cost. During a first-year biology major ecology course, three free educational materials are utilized: OpenStax Biology textbook, Lucidchart online diagraming tool, and Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) BioInteractive. Although all three are available digitally and at no cost to students, only one meets the definition of OER. The difference is in copyrights. OpenStax textbooks are licensed under the Creative Commons 4.0 International License (CC), which allows anyone to use, reuse, change, and republish the content (with attribution only). Lucidchart is a commercial (and copyrighted) subscription web tool that currently provides free access for educational use. BioInteractive materials are created specifically for educational use, in accord with HHMI's mission; however, the copyrights held by HHMI, and their contracted partners do not permit changing and republishing the content. Instructors who search specifically for OERs may miss a rich body of content freely available to educators and students alike. © 2017 Sharmila Pixy Ferris and Hilary Wilder.

AB  - Disciplinary boundaries become increasingly unclear when grappling with “wicked problems,” which present a complex set of policy, cultural, technological, and scientific dimensions. “T-shaped” professionals, i.e. individuals with a depth and breadth of expertise, are being called upon to play a critical role in complex problem-solving. This paper unpacks the notion of the “T-shaped expert” and seeks to situate it within the broader academic literature on expertise, integration, and developmental learning. A component of this project includes an exploratory study, which is aimed at evaluating the emergent attributes of T-shaped expertise in two different educational programs completed between January and May in 2015. The two programs build disciplinary knowledge in science, technology engineering, and mathematics fields at the core (vertical dimension), while expanding the students’ awareness and comprehension of other expertise (horizontal dimension). The courses introduced science and engineering students to case study topics focusing around complex human-technological-ecological systems in a nanotechnology and society course; and the governance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a science, technology, and society course. We analyze pre- and post-test data from this pilot project before presenting findings that pertain to student learning, as well as variants in the methodology and reflect on the utility (and limitations) of the selected methodology for evaluating expertise as it evolves over time. The paper closes with a discussion of a theory of acquisition with implications for delineating early attributes and characteristics of T-shaped expertise. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - This research applied the learning strategies to predict in an effect longitudinal growth of cognitive structure of students in biology. The aim of the research is to assess the effect of activating learning strategies on cognitive structures regarding biology. The research was conducted by using control group design. The sample of research was composed of 60 prospective teachers randomly assigned to the experimental and the control groups. The longitudinal data were collected every 2 weeks and 4 times in total considering the concept maps. The data were quantitatively analysed in terms of the number of concepts, connections and central concepts. Latent growth modelling (LGM) was used to analyse change in cognitive structure over time. The findings suggested that the experimental group did better in cognitive structure than the control group in terms of forming connections and central concepts. Accordingly, teaching students self-regulated learning strategies and providing support in the written material to activate the strategies influence the development of cognitive structure in a positive way in terms of the extent and the integration. Therefore, activation of the use of self-regulated learning strategies in the teaching are thought to contribute to the learning of biology. © 2016, Scientific Methodical Center. All rights reserved.

AB  - Energy is an interdisciplinary concept which is directly or indirectly related to many concepts in sciences. As a result of not employing an interdisciplinary teaching in teaching the energy topic, the researches done in both our country and other countries show that students’ perceptions related to energy is far from being scientific. The purpose of this research is to determine to what extent grade- 8 students associate the situations related to energy that they often encounter in daily life to energy. For this purpose, data were collected from 435 grade-8 students using the CoMPAT technique, which is a concept mapping technique that is carried out with photographs. The results of the research show that students cannot establish a connection between energy and living things and chemical substances. They know the physical dimension of energy better than chemical and biological dimensions of energy. This indicates that an integration among disciplines cannot be provided in teaching energy topic. © 2018. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of transferring and contriving the perspective and message from a collection of written or spoken text, in the context of teaching English writing as foreign d language. The entire research was conducted with a view to create a writing strategy for use in the popular EFL workbook, New Interchange 3. The research further developed into concept mapping the learners’ ability at a pre-writing stage on English as a foreign language (EFL) to generate better argumentative essays. On the basis of the results achieved through analytical and experimental case study, the paper intended to design a course plan for the non-native learners of English in the TEFL Writing classes at the College of Languages and Translation, King Saud University. The paper further evaluated and examined the usefulness of the language tools of corpus, collocation and context as pre-writing strategies. It has been the desired objective of the researcher to observe, analyze, and establish the importance of corpus, collocation and context (C3) as viable pre-writing tools. A case study was conducted to ascertain and present the scientific practicability of the teaching of transferring and manipulating a context as a pre-writing strategy. © 2017 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.

AB  - Previous studies in Malang, Indonesia showed that there were the failure biology learning caused by not only the low students' prior knowledge, but also biology learning model has not improved the students' critical thinking skills yet, which affected the low of cognitive learning outcomes. The learning model is required to improve students' critical thinking skills. Learning model that considered able to solve this problem is a model that combines reading, constructing concept maps, and the implementation cooperative learning type Numbered Heads Together (Remap NHT) in the classroom. This study was quasi experimental research that compared the effect of Remap NHT learning model and traditional learning in biology classroom to improve critical thinking skills at Xth grade students of senior school in Malang, Indonesia. The results showed that the implementation of Remap NHT during biology classroom showed the effect on students' critical thinking skills. © 2016 EdUHK APFSLT.

AB  - The pupils' poor performance in science in South African secondary schools is well documented. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to conduct a study that would portray knowledge structures for teaching a science topic. This is an empirical qualitative interpretive multiple case study looking at four physical science teachers teaching Doppler Effect to Grade 12 pupils. The data was collected through classroom observations and teacher interviews. Data analysis was done using concept maps. The results show that teachers' knowledge as portrayed during the teaching lack coherence and to some extent the correctness that is expected of teachers. The weaknesses are considered likely to compromise their pupils' conceptual understanding of the topic. © 2018 by the authors.

AB  - Helping scientists and engineers challenge received assumptions about how science, engineering, and society relate is a critical cornerstone for macroethics education. Scientific and engineering research are frequently framed as first steps of a value-free linear model that inexorably leads to societal benefit. Social studies of science and assessments of scientific and engineering research speak to the need for a more critical approach to the noble intentions underlying these assumptions. “Science Outside the Lab” is a program designed to help early-career scientists and engineers understand the complexities of science and engineering policy. Assessment of the program entailed a pre-, post-, and 1 year follow up survey to gauge student perspectives on relationships between science and society, as well as a pre–post concept map exercise to elicit student conceptualizations of science policy. Students leave Science Outside the Lab with greater humility about the role of scientific expertise in science and engineering policy; greater skepticism toward linear notions of scientific advances benefiting society; a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the actors involved in shaping science policy; and a continued appreciation of the contributions of science and engineering to society. The study presents an efficacious program that helps scientists and engineers make inroads into macroethical debates, reframe the ways in which they think about values of science and engineering in society, and more thoughtfully engage with critical mediators of science and society relationships: policy makers and policy processes. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The study is aimed at finding an effective learning strategy that can increase metacognitive knowledge. Metacognitive knowledge is a standard that based on 2016-revised edition of 2013 curriculum needs to be achieved by every graduate in all level of education in Indonesia. The study is conducted in three different schools and engages 207 students, which then divided into six groups. The groups are students who study under mind mapping strategy, concept mapping, reciprocal teaching using summary notes, reciprocal teaching using mind mapping, problem-based learning, and investigation group. The results showed that those studying under problem-based learning strategy spent a significantly higher numbers in metacognitive knowledge in biology learning and followed by students who study under reciprocal teaching using mind mapping. According to the finding, it is expected that teachers of Biology will practice problem-based learning strategy in their classroom in order to increase the Metacognitive knowledge. © 2017 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.

AB  - Concept mapping methodology as refined by Trochim et al. is uniquely suited to engage communities in all aspects of research from project set-up to data collection to interpreting results to dissemination of results, and an increasing number of research studies have utilized the methodology for exploring complex health issues in communities. In the current manuscript, we present the results of a literature search of peer-reviewed articles in health-related research where concept mapping was used in collaboration with the community. A total of 103 articles met the inclusion criteria. We first address how community engagement was defined in the articles and then focus on the articles describing high community engagement and the associated community outcomes/benefits and methodological challenges. A majority (61%; n = 63) of the articles were classified as low to moderate community engagement and participation while 38% (n = 39) of the articles were classified as high community engagement and participation. The results of this literature review enhance our understanding of how concept mapping can be used in direct collaboration with communities and highlights the many potential benefits for both researchers and communities. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - Individual differences in the performance profiles of neuropsychologically-impaired patients are pervasive yet there is still no resolution on the best way to model and account for the variation in their behavioural impairments and the associated neural correlates. To date, researchers have generally taken one of three different approaches: a single-case study methodology in which each case is considered separately; a case-series design in which all individual patients from a small coherent group are examined and directly compared; or, group studies, in which a sample of cases are investigated as one group with the assumption that they are drawn from a homogenous category and that performance differences are of no interest. In recent research, we have developed a complementary alternative through the use of principal component analysis (PCA) of individual data from large patient cohorts. This data-driven approach not only generates a single unified model for the group as a whole (expressed in terms of the emergent principal components) but is also able to capture the individual differences between patients (in terms of their relative positions along the principal behavioural axes). We demonstrate the use of this approach by considering speech fluency, phonology and semantics in aphasia diagnosis and classification, as well as their unique neural correlates. PCA of the behavioural data from 31 patients with chronic post-stroke aphasia resulted in four statistically-independent behavioural components reflecting phonological, semantic, executive–cognitive and fluency abilities. Even after accounting for lesion volume, entering the four behavioural components simultaneously into a voxel-based correlational methodology (VBCM) analysis revealed that speech fluency (speech quanta) was uniquely correlated with left motor cortex and underlying white matter (including the anterior section of the arcuate fasciculus and the frontal aslant tract), phonological skills with regions in the superior temporal gyrus and pars opercularis, and semantics with the anterior temporal stem. © 2016 The Author(s)

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times, because economics and industries depend on innovation. Creativity is therefore a requirement for school graduates, especially for the ones who strive to pursue a technical or scientific career. But creativity has not been integrated into the curricula of STEM subjects in many European countries like Germany. To successfully integrate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers' views and conceptions on creativity, because they have an influence on teaching and lesson planning. This is the purpose of this study. To investigate the views and conceptions, a research instrument especially designed for this study is used. It includes the creation of two concept maps and filling out a questionnaire. The study was carried out using fifteen German chemistry teachers. The evaluation of the data was made qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It has revealed that almost all of the teachers in this study had a positive attitude towards creativity and had experiences referring to integrating creativity into their own chemistry lessons. But not all of these experiences are good ones and there were some aspects with regard to creativity in general, where uncertainties could be identified. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.

AB  - Background. Wetlands are highly productive systems that supply a host of ecosystem services and benefits. Nonetheless, wetlands have been drained and filled to provide sites for building houses and roads and for establishing farmland, with an estimated worldwide loss of 64-71% of wetland systems since 1900. In Europe, the Natura 2000 network is the cornerstone of current conservation strategies. Every six years, Member States must report on implementation of the European Habitats Directive. The present study aims to illustrate how Earth observation (EO) technologies can contribute to the reporting obligations of the Habitats Directive and Natura 2000 network in relation to wetland ecosystems. Methods. We analysed the habitat changes that occurred in a protected wetland (in NW Spain), 13 years after its designation as Natura 2000 site (i.e., between 2003 and 2016). For this purpose, we analysed optical multispectral bands and water-related and vegetation indices derived from data acquired by Landsat 7 TM, ETMC and Landsat 8 OLI sensors. To quantify the uncertainty arising from the algorithm used in the classification procedure and its impact on the change analysis, we compared the habitat change estimates obtained using 10 different classification algorithms and two ensemble classification approaches (majority and weighted vote). Results. The habitat maps derived from the ensemble approaches showed an overall accuracy of 94% for the 2003 data (Kappa index of 0.93) and of 95% for the 2016 data (Kappa index of 0.94). The change analysis revealed important temporal dynamics between 2003 and 2016 for the habitat classes identified in the study area. However, these changes depended on the classification algorithm used. The habitat maps obtained from the two ensemble classification approaches showed a reduction in habitat classes dominated by salt marshes and meadows (24.6-26.5%), natural and semi-natural grasslands (25.9-26.5%) or sand dunes (20.7-20.9%) and an increase in forest (31- 34%) and reed bed (60.7-67.2%) in the study area. Discussion. This study illustrates how EO-based approaches might be particularly useful to help (1) managers to reach decisions in relation to conservation, (2) Member States to comply with the requirements of the European Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC), and (3) the European Commission to monitor the conservation status of the natural habitat types of community interest listed in Annex I of the Directive. Nonetheless, the uncertainty arising from the large variety of classification methods used may prevent local managers from basing their decisions on EO data. Our results shed light on how different classification algorithms may provide very different quantitative estimates, especially for water-dependent habitats. Our findings confirm the need to account for this uncertainty by applying ensemble classification approaches, which improve the accuracy and stability of remote sensing image classification. © 2018 Regos and Domínguez.

AB  - We present a system that utilizes a wide variety of available assessment information to automatically analyze students' understanding at a conceptual level and offer relevant automated support to teachers and students. This support includes interactive visualization of the conceptual knowledge assessment, individualized suggestions for resources to improve areas of weakness, and suggestions for dynamic student groups for inclass activities. This system differs from prior related work in that the basis for analysis and feedback is entirely customized to the individual instructors' course content. We discuss how the system is configured for each course, and provide evidence that this configuration process helps instructors improve their course content. We then provide detailed descriptions of how the system performs analysis and offers support including suggesting resources for students and creating dynamic groups within a class. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits provided by this system and how the system is being applied to six different computer science courses currently.

AB  - The use of animated concept mapping (ACM) has been linked to an innovative learning skill when conducting students’ guidance of 4 corresponding reasoning processes in electrochemistry. This research aims to establish a new perspective with ACM cognitive reasoning to broaden students’ individual developments of problem-solving skills. It is followed by a quasi-experimental approach of pre-tests, post-tests and retention-tests designed for 274 qualified college students in Taiwan. All data collected from students’ learning performances and feedback is further analyzed by means of achievement covariance, t-tests and one-way ANOVA. Analytical results reveal that ACM facilitates learning comparisons and out-performances in two groups of students in different post-test and retention-test scores. Students’ positive feedback and learning disposition also provide the predominant advantage for participants’ successful reasoning processes. Pedagogical implications suggest that ACM learning performances result in more significant collaborative reasoning. © 2018, Scientia Socialis Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve students' concept comprehension using concept map as a consolidation phase based STAD. This study was conducted by randomized control group pretest-posttest. Data was collected by using an instrument test to evaluate the effect of concept map as a consolidation phase based STAD on students'understanding about environmental pollution. Data was analyzed using normalized gain (n-gain) and independent t-test. The n-gain analysis shows the increased of students's understanding about environmental pollution at experimental group arehigher than at the control group. The result of this study showed that students' comprehension at the experimental class (0,53) higher compared to the control group (0,23). Whilst the t-test analysis shows that there is a significant effect of mapping concept as a consolidation phase based STAD towards students' concept comprehension. It can be concluded that the implementation of mapping concept based STAD may improve the students's understanding on science concept. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Sustainability is a systems problem with interconnected socio-economic-ecological factors. To advance sustainable infrastructure, engineers are expected to more quickly think in systems from individual components to relationships between them. Until recently, understanding of cognition for sustainability was limited to investigating behavior and its outcomes. However, the emergence of neuroimaging techniques enables the collection of objective physiological data in the brain. By measuring the cognitive activation, we can construct a more detailed understanding of the mental processes during systems and linear thinking tasks related to engineering sustainability. Wearing a functional near infrared spectroscopy system, which measures changes in hemodynamic response, engineering students (n = 17) developed both lists and concept maps related to sustainability topics. The results show that systems thinking leads to more concepts generated and requires more cognitive activation in Brodmann area (BA) 46 (BA46 is associated with cognitive flexibility) while less activation in BA39 (associated with sequence and visuospatial processing). Moreover, the brain network analysis indicates the cognitive barriers for engineering students to think in systems for sustainability with lower global efficiency to cognitively integrate information and lower clustering coefficient to separately deal with information in the brain compared to linear thinking. This study is the first step in constructing a better cognition model and brain networks of systems thinking for sustainability. The next step can be how education training cognitively improves systems thinking among engineering students. © ASCE.

AB  - This study aimed to discover subject-specific science teachers' views of alternative assessment. The questionnaire by Okur (2008) was adapted and deployed for data collection. The sample consisted of 80 subject-specific science teachers drawn from the cities of Trabzon, Rize and Erzurum in Turkey. In analyzing data, descriptive analysis was employed for identifying how often the subject-specific science teachers use the alternative assessment and which of the alternative assessment techniques are frequently preferred. Also, how gender variable affects their preference and/or self-competency was analyzed via independent samples t-test. In light of the results, it can be deduced that the subject-specific science teachers tended to use such traditional assessment techniques as multiple choice test, concept map, written test, and matching test. Further, the main barrier to involve the alternative assessment in science classes seems to be the high-staking nation-wide exams in Turkey that deploy only multiple-choice questions. Therefore, any change in assessment strategy of the high-staking nation-wide exams may foster teachers to enrich their preferences of alternative assessment and empower its possible use in science classes. © 2017 EdUHK APFSLT.

AB  - Objectives Extracting data from publication reports is a standard process in systematic review (SR) development. However, the data extraction process still relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process. Methods We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were evaluated in finding common clinical SR data elements such as sample size, group size, and PICO values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review's study characteristics tables. Results At the sentence level, the computer-generated summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 91.2% vs. 83.8%, p < 0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences (precision 59% vs. 39%, p < 0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7% F-measure. Conclusion Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an extractive summarization system. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: The critical shortage of human resources in health is a critical public health problem affecting most low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to the shortage of health professionals, attracting and retaining them in rural areas is a challenge. The objective of the study was to understand the factors that influence the attraction and retention of health professionals working in rural areas in Niger. Methods: A mixed-method study was conducted in Tillabery region, Niger. A conceptual framework was used that included five dimensions. Three data collection methods were employed: in-depth interviews, documentary analysis, and concept mapping. In-depth interviews were conducted with three main actor groups: policy-makers and Ministry of Health officials (n = 15), health professionals (n = 102), and local health managers (n = 46). Concept mapping was conducted with midwifery students (n = 29). Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were performed to analyse the data from the concept mapping method. A content analysis was conducted for the qualitative data. Results: The results of the study showed that the local environment, which includes living conditions (no electricity, lack of availability of schools), social factors (isolation, national and local insecurity), working conditions (workload), the lack of financial compensation, and individual factors (marital status, gender), influences the attraction and retention of health professionals to work in rural areas. Human resources policies do not adequately take into account the factors influencing the retention of rural health professionals. Conclusion: Intersectoral policies are needed to improve living conditions and public services in rural areas. The government should also take into account the feminization of the medical profession and the social and cultural norms related to marital status and population mobility when formulating human resources management policies. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Although studies repeatedly show both the importance of teachers’ science subject matter knowledge (SMK) and the fact that teachers have limited SMK, there are few opportunities for teachers to formally enhance their understanding of science after entering the classroom. Therefore, there is significant need for teachers to develop their SMK through classroom experience. In this longitudinal study, we explore the development of new secondary science teachers’ SMK by analyzing concept maps constructed in their 1st year of teaching and in their 5th year of teaching. We present a scoring system that reliably accounts for both the quality of connections and knowledge structure. Based on the findings presented, we conclude that these new chemistry teachers’ SMK did not change significantly from their 1st year of teaching to their 5th year of teaching. Implications for teacher educators and future research are presented. © 2017 Association for Science Teacher Education.

AB  - A simple "stop think" approach was developed to encourage the self-assessment of learning. A key element was the requirement for students to rate their feeling of difficulty before [FOD(pre)] and after [FOD(post)] completing each of three authentic anatomy and physiology concept map exercises. The cohort was divided into low- (group L) and highperforming (group H) groups (based on final subject marks). Both FOD(pre) (group L) and FOD(post) (groups L and H) were significantly negatively correlated with score for some maps. A comparison of FOD(pre) and FOD(post) showed that students changed their mind about difficulty in 58-70% of the completed maps. Students who changed their estimation were asked to provide explanatory comments, and an increase in difficulty was related to problems with map link generation. For students who found the maps easier, 40% of comments indicated that map generation prompted recall of information from memory. Both difficulty estimations and comments supported the contention that students were self-assessing their interaction with the concept maps. Group H was significantly older than group L, had significantly higher levels of deep strategic and deep motivational learning, and had significantly higher marks in two of three concept map exercises. Notwithstanding these differences, the results from the "stop think" approach were similar between groups, indicating that it may be appropriate for students of varying academic ability. It is suggested that "stop think" may be a useful approach to encourage student self-assessment, an important step in assisting self-regulated learning development. © 2017 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - The first step to starting research is to familiarize with the research field, which is a difficult task for non-experts. They usually do not know which exact information to gather or which strategy to follow. There exists some literature on supporting them by means of guidelines, visualizations and critical thinking. However, they must be supported such that they can form their own strategies to objectively evaluate the research field. Therefore, a tool was developed to help non-experts identify which information to gather, structure the gathered information by means of a visualization and perform the task in a time-efficient manner. Finally, a user study was conducted to investigate the validity of the proposed approach. Results show that the developed software tool supports non-experts in their literature review process by providing them with an overview of the research field and making the process time-efficient. © 2018 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Many students are challenged with the demand of writing cohesive explanations. To support students in writing cohesive explanations, we developed a computer-based feedback tool that visualizes cohesion deficits of students' explanations in a concept map. We conducted three studies to investigate the effectiveness of such feedback as well as the underlying cognitive processes. In Study 1, we found that the concept map helped students identify potential cohesion gaps in their drafts and plan remedial revisions. In Study 2, students with concept map feedback conducted revisions that resulted in more locally and globally cohesive, and also more comprehensible, explanations than the explanations of students who revised without concept map feedback. In Study 3, we replicated the findings of Study 2 by and large. More importantly, students who had received concept map feedback on a training explanation 1 week later wrote a transfer explanation without feedback that was more cohesive than the explanation of students who had received no feedback on their training explanation. The automated concept map feedback appears to particularly support the evaluation phase of the revision process. Furthermore, the feedback enabled novice writers to acquire sustainable skills in writing cohesive explanations. © 2017 American Psychological Association.

AB  - Events such as clinical interventions, adverse drug events are one of the basic semantic units in the clinical workflow and are the foundation of the pathway representation. Current research has mainly concentrated on event recognition through concept mapping using from medical ontologies (UMLS, SNOMED CT) and gene relation detection in the biological context. However, the analysis of the patient status and the interaction between the patient status and a context event is still at the primary stage. In order to realize an efficient personalized treatment design and pathway planning, the correlation between a patient status and different types of clinical events should be analyzed. In this paper, we will provide a summary of the current research progress in clinical event detection in the biomedical domain and compare two approaches of event acquisition: An event schema produced using a guideline-based method and an expert-based annotation. We will apply the approaches to generate a structured annotation corpus and a special case of an event schema based on the complication classification and risk management in treatment of laryngeal cancer. © 2016 European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) and IOS Press.

AB  - Introduction: Cervical adenocarcinoma represents a critical health problem in many underserved regions of the world and parts of the U.S. This module provides learning opportunities in the areas of female anatomy, physiology, histology, and pathology. This includes diagnosis by ultrasound and CT/PET scan, detailed staging and treatment of the cancer by various criteria, and future prevention by vaccination and screening. Methods: Authors include a fourth-year medical student and a seasoned PBL facilitator with a basic science interest in cancer. In this problem-based learning module (PBL), a group of first-year medical students review the material that is released online for each of three weekly 90-minute sessions. Key learning issues are identified, researched out-of-class, and discussed at the beginning of the subsequent session. A differential diagnosis is weighed and the module culminates with a concept map drawn by students to integrate all relevant aspects and mechanisms of the case. Results: The module was implemented twice with a small group of seven students. Students learned to correlate relevant biochemical mechanisms, histological, and anatomical features with the clinical signs and symptoms, to diagnose and suggest treatment options. The module was well-liked, and revised for publication by rebalancing the material based on specific student feedback. Discussion: The PBL small-group format provides a unique opportunity over both semesters for first-year medical students to study clinical cases in a student-directed fashion and develop professional skills at various levels. Potential pitfalls lie in the online format, as this requires clear rules on computer usage and data sharing.

AB  - Online learning has been applied in various educational institutions, and have some positive effects on the conventional learning, especially if both learning is collaborated. Online learning helps teaching difficulties in conventional learning where learning process of individual student is hard to know in detailed by the teacher because of too many students in a single class. With online learning assisted by Learning Management System (LMS) teachers can know each student individual learning process by analyzing student log activity on the LMS which is often called by behavioral tracking. LMS used as research material is Moodle that has been applied to the Computer Science Education Department, UPI. The purpose of this research is to find learning status of each student by analyzing student's behavior while using the Moodle LMS. One of behavioral tracking model which can be used to determine the student's learning status is Monitoring Online Course with Log Data (MOCLog) model. By combining the concept map, and solution map, this model can analyze log data on Moodle LMS, and generate learning status of each individual student. Then the teacher can determine what behavioral traits are dominant, and most influential on learning with association rule data mining technique with apriori algorithms. This study provides that dominant learning status on the Computer Network course with 84.75 % students is Normal Learning Status while Frequent Access the Course to be an activity that greatly affect the student's learning status in the Moodle LMS course with 48 students. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study follows two groups of students (67 in all) through the 3 years of their high school biology education and examines the development of their systems thinking - specifically their models of the human body as a system. Both groups were composed of biology majors, but the students in one group also participated in a PBLbased extension program called “Medical Systems”. Data was gathered by means of concept maps, which the students completed at four strategic stages of the learning process: beginning of 10th grade, end of 10th grade, end of 11th grade and end of 12th grade. At the end of the 3 year learning process, the students’ showed more complex system models. They included a wider range of concepts in their maps, spanning hierarchy levels ranging from the molecular and cellular to the system level. We also found an increase in references to dynamic interactions, but this did not encourage the students to use cellular level processes when explaining phenomena that occur at the systems level. The impact of the PBL teaching method was strongly evident in the complexity of the Medical Systems program students’ concept maps, which heavily emphasized “hierarchy” and “diseases” as system characteristics. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - This paper considers the analysis of concept maps utilized as a learning tool in disciplines dealing with immunological responses in two undergraduate Health programs. In total, 48 concept maps were assessed regarding their propositions and structure. The clarity of the propositions was analyzed by using the Propositional Clarity Table and they were classified as adequate propositions (AP) and inadequate propositions (IP). In 48 concept maps, 648 propositions were analyzed in order to determine semantic clarity and conceptual mistakes. Assessments revealed that 69 % of the propositions were classified as adequate and 31 % as inadequate. All the maps analyzed were categorized as showing a network structure. However, when correlating the connections established among the several types of response by the immune system, it was found that despite being structured as a network, only 31.2 % of the concept maps indicated conceptual relationships between the modes of immune response. 27% of the concept maps were made with a high rate of proficiency. Upon the results of our analysis, we realized that there is still a long way in developing the mapping strategy. For us, this low percentage is related to the way undergraduates assimilate the mapping processes. This is a challenge which also reveals limits and weaknesses that may be addressed in future studies. It was noted that results bring into focus that the undergraduates' learning of concepts associated with the bases of the immunological responses occurred in a meaningful way.

AB  - Two forms of interactive video were assessed in an online course focused on conservation. The hypothesis was that interactive video enhances student perceptions about learning and improves mental models of social-ecological systems. Results showed that students reported greater learning and attitudes toward the subject following interactive video. Moreover, metrics of network complexity applied to students' concept maps of socio-ecological systems increased longitudinally through the course highlighting greater awareness of socio-ecological linkages. We conclude that interactive video can increase awareness of interdisciplinary connections in socio-ecological systems and should be more widely employed in general education geography courses. © 2018 National Council for Geographic Education.

AB  - Formative assessment is a new method of educational assessment. In contrast to summative assessment, formative assessment constitutes a relatively modern assessment method, whose goal is to reveal the student's weaknesses to the teacher and help the teacher to design accordingly appropriate practices to aid the students improve their performance. Formative assessment application can be done periodically and can be categorized to short-term, when executed between classes, and to long-term. Several innovative assessment techniques for assessment in engineering education have been proposed during the recent years, such as the use of concept maps, assessing student's Learning Outcomes, five step outcome driven assessment and more, both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. A smart system especially designed and implemented for the particular needs of engineering education and STEM education in general, is presented on this paper. Such a system is currently under development and tested for the purposes of mathematical education in primary and secondary education. If the right adjustments and modifications are made, it can work for STEM education as well. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - The need for assessing higher level thinking skills and using appropriate evaluation methods in programs for the gifted is necessary to better evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. The purpose of this study was to test the claim of Novak and Gowin (1984) that concept maps required higher level thinking skills. A related purpose of the study was to assess which type of measure, a multiple choice test or concept maps, could yield a more accurate or detailed picture of the gains in content understanding of students performing at the highest level on the instruments. A mixed method research design was used to answer the research questions. We concluded that concept maps and multiple choice tests did not measure or require the same thinking skills because of non-significant correlations between the two instruments. Three judges' qualitative analysis also indicated that the number of items requiring higher level thinking skills on multiple choice tests was limited. Concept mapping as a whole process and the crosslinks component of concept mapping required analysis or higher level thinking skills. Also we concluded that concept mapping as a whole process has the potential to show greater gains in scores of the students than the multiple choice items, and crosslinks component of concept mapping that required analysis or higher level thinking skills. To have an alignment between the curricula of programs for gifted students and assessment methods used in these programs, the search for assessment methods requiring higher thinking skills is necessary and needs more investigation. © 2015 Journal for the Education of Gifted Young Scientists.

AB  - Introduction Dissemination and implementation research training has great potential to improve the impact and reach of health-related research; however, research training needs from the end user perspective are unknown. This paper identifies and prioritizes dissemination and implementation research training needs. Methods A diverse sample of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers was invited to participate in Concept Mapping in 2014–2015. Phase 1 (Brainstorming) gathered participants’ responses to the prompt: To improve the impact of research evidence in practice and policy settings, a skill in which researchers need more training is… The resulting statement list was edited and included subsequent phases. Phase 2 (Sorting) asked participants to sort each statement into conceptual piles. In Phase 3 (Rating), participants rated the difficulty and importance of incorporating each statement into a training curriculum. A multidisciplinary team synthesized and interpreted the results in 2015–2016. Results During Brainstorming, 60 researchers and 60 practitioners/policymakers contributed 274 unique statements. Twenty-nine researchers and 16 practitioners completed sorting and rating. Nine concept clusters were identified: Communicating Research Findings, Improve Practice Partnerships, Make Research More Relevant, Strengthen Communication Skills, Develop Research Methods and Measures, Consider and Enhance Fit, Build Capacity for Research, and Understand Multilevel Context. Though researchers and practitioners had high agreement about importance (r =0.93) and difficulty (r =0.80), ratings differed for several clusters (e.g., Build Capacity for Research). Conclusions Including researcher and practitioner perspectives in competency development for dissemination and implementation research identifies skills and capacities needed to conduct and communicate contextualized, meaningful, and relevant research. © 2016 American Journal of Preventive Medicine

AB  - Concept maps are used in teaching and learning as representations of students’ understanding of conceptual knowledge. Concept maps are basically networks of interlinked web of concepts. A long-standing problem in educational research is identifying the key concepts of importance in such networks. Here we use network analysis to examine students’ representations of the relatedness of physics concepts in the form of concept maps, and suggest how key concepts and their epistemic support can be identified. The concept maps are analysed as directed and weighted networks, where nodes are concepts and links represent different types of connections between concepts. The notion of key concept is operationalised through the communicability, separately for out-going and in-coming weighted links. Using a collated concept network based on a sample of 12 original concept maps constructed by university students we show that the communicability is a simple and reliable way to identify the key concepts and examine their epistemic justification within the network. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - We present a teacher support system to enable inter-class integration with Cross-Border Public Classes. These are lessons where students from classes in two different countries participate in the same lesson synchronously, while tens or hundreds of other teachers actively observe and record their observations. Later, a panel analyzes the lesson and the teacher reviews the observations. The system presented is a cloud-based teacher support system that allows the teacher to ask open-ended questions, with peer review between students. It also summarizes the students’ answers using automatically generated concept maps, as well as recording and analyzing the teacher’s discourse. Furthermore, the system also receives annotations from the observers. We describe our experience of using this system with Cross-Border Public Classes while teaching a lesson in STEM focusing on energy. The lesson involved two eighth-grade classes from two different countries. We found that Cross-Border Public Classes are an innovative alternative made possible by an Intelligent Teacher Support System. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.

AB  - This work discusses repertory grid analysis as a tool for investigating the structures of students’ representations of biological concepts. Repertory grid analysis provides the researcher with a variety of techniques that are not associated with standard methods of concept mapping for investigating conceptual structures. It can provide valuable insights into the learning process, and can be used as a diagnostic tool in identifying problems that students have in understanding biological concepts. The biological concepts examined in this work are ‘natural kinds’: a technical class of concepts which ‘appear’ to have invisible ‘essences’ meaning carrying more perceptual weight than being perceptually similar. Because children give more weight to natural-kind membership when reasoning about traits, it would seem pertinent to apply such knowledge to deep-level research into how children reason in biology. The concept of natural kinds has a particular resonance with biology since biological kinds hold the distinction of being almost all natural kinds, such as when the same ‘stuff or thing’ takes many different forms. We have conducted a range of studies using a diversity of biological natural kinds, but in this paper, we wish to explore some of the theoretical underpinnings in more detail. To afford this exploration, we outline one case-study in a small group of secondary school students exploring the concept of ‘equine’ – that is, what is an equine? Five positive examples were chosen to engaged with by the students and one ‘outlier’ with which to compare the construction process. Recommendations are offered in applying this approach to biological education research. © 2017, University of Ljubljana. All rights reserved.

AB  - Phenomenon: The integration of public health (PH) competency training into medical education, and further integration of PH and primary care, has been urged by the U.S. Institute of Medicine. However, PH competencies are numerous, and no consensus exists over which competencies are most important for adoption by current trainees. Our objective was to conduct a group concept mapping exercise with stakeholders identifying the most important and feasible PH skills to incorporate in medical and residency curricula. Approach: We utilized a group concept mapping technique via the Concept System Global Max (http://www.conceptsystems.com), where family medicine educators and PH professionals completed the phrase, “A key Public Health competency for physicians-in-training to learn is …” with 1–10 statements. The statement list was edited for duplication and other issues; stakeholders then sorted the statements and rated them for importance and feasibility of integration. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were used to create a two-dimensional point map of domains of PH training, allowing visual comparison of groupings of related ideas and relative importance of these ideas. Findings: There were 116 nonduplicative statements (225 total) suggested by 120 participants. Three metacategories of competencies emerged: Clinic, Community & Culture, Health System Understanding, and Population Health Science & Data. Insights: We identified and organized a set of topics that serve as a foundation for the integration of family medicine and PH education. Incorporating these topics into medical education is viewed as important and feasible by family medicine educators and PH professions. © 2017 The Author(s).

AB  - Objective The aim of this concept mapping study was to identify the structure and alleged importance of perpetuating factors of functional somatic symptoms (FSS) from the perspective of professionals. Further, we examined to which extent these factors have been addressed in scientific literature. Methods Ninety-nine perpetuating factors were sorted with respect to content using a card-sorting task by 61 experienced clinicians (62.3% psychologists, 75.4% female, mean age: 45.7 [SD: 10.6] years, mean duration of experience in treating FSS patients: 10.5 [SD: 7.6] years). These factors had been derived from in-depth interviews with 12 clinicians, with extensive experience in treating FSS. Thirty-eight clinicians rated the importance of the 99 factors on a scale ranging from 1 (‘not important at all’) to 10 (‘extremely important’). Results Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed three overarching domains of perpetuating factors: ‘Hypochondria’, ‘Social and relational problems’ and ‘Symptom-related emotions and habits’. These domains comprised 16 clusters, which were rated on importance between 6.1, ‘Adverse physical factors and counterproductive lifestyle’, and 7.8, ‘Frustration and despair regarding the symptoms’. All clusters have been addressed in scientific literature. Conclusions This study revealed an encompassing hierarchical structure of somatic, emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and social factors of importance in the perpetuation of FSS based on expert opinions. This structure will guide the development of personalized treatment of FSS. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times, especially for school graduates who strive for pursuing a technical or scientific career. But creativity has not been integrated in the lessons or curricula of STEM subjects. To successfully integrate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers' and student teachers' views on creativity. A study with seventeen German student teachers, studying chemistry on a Master's degree, is already carried out using a new research instrument that includes the creation of concept maps and filling out a questionnaire. The implementation of this study, the analysis and evaluation of the data and a comparison with literature data are described in this article. One result of this study is that the methods are an adequate approach to investigate views and knowledge about creativity. Regarding this, all of the students already had conceptions, views and an understanding about creativity in general and in the context of chemistry education, although they did not get input on the topic. Furthermore, almost all of the students had a positive attitude towards creativity and its integration in chemistry lessons. However, also uncertainties like the definition of creativity could be identified. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Integrating disciplinary thinking has become a critical component of higher education in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. Within STEM disciplines, students are introduced to a wide range of multidisciplinary projects, courses, and programmes. Multidisciplinary projects require students to collaborate with other students, educators and professionals from diverse academic and professional backgrounds. Working in teams can be challenging for students especially when they are seldom taught how to collaborate with other disciplines. The goal of the study is to understand students’ opinions on multidisciplinary collaboration. Students from engineering and design were asked to develop concept maps that illustrate aspects of successful multidisciplinary teamwork. Concept maps were scored by counting concepts, hierarchical levels and cross-links. Content analysis was conducted to qualitatively understand the key concepts and nature of relationship between the concepts. Characteristics of multidisciplinary teamwork were compared across disciplines. Communication, teamwork, conflict resolution, celebrating diversity and finding a common goal were identified as key determinants of successful multidisciplinary teams. The outcomes of the study have several implications for educators and institutions planning to develop or improve multidisciplinary projects, courses or programmes. © 2018 Institution of Engineering Designers The Design Society.

AB  - The goal of this research is to identify positive practices used when conducting community-based research with people living with vulnerable conditions. Community-based research practitioners who participated in the research included 37 researchers, community partners, program planners, and government employees, working in health, human services, children and youth, and education sectors. Concept mapping, a participatory stakeholder-driven process, was used to generate a framework of how community-based research practitioners responded to the complex environments of people living with vulnerable conditions when conducting research. Respondents generated positive practices, determined relationships among practices, and rated practices on frequency of use and perceived effectiveness. This study revealed 7 clusters of positive practices: ethical practices, participant supports, social accountability, community involvement, language competence, financial compensation, and project management. © 2017 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The generative topographic mapping (GTM) approach has been used both to build predictive models linking chemical structure of molecules and their ability to bind some membrane transport proteins (transporters) and to visualize a chemical space of transporters’ binders on two-dimensional maps. For this purpose, experimental data on 2958 molecules active against up to 11 transporters have been used. It has been shown that GTM-based classification (active/inactive) models display reasonable predictive performance, comparable with that of such popular machine-learning methods as Random Forest, SVM, or k-NN. Moreover, GTM offers its own models applicability domain definition which may significantly improve the models performance. GTM maps themselves represent an interesting tool of the chemical space analysis of the transporters’ ligands. Thus, with the help of class landscapes, they identify distinct zones populated by active or inactive molecules with respect to a given transporter. As demonstrated in this paper, the superposition of class landscapes describing different activities delineates the areas mostly populated by the compounds of desired pharmacological profile. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Educational transformation in the 21st century demands in-depth knowledge and understanding in order to promote the development of higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). However, the most commonly reported problem with respect to developing a knowledge of chemistry is poor mastery of basic concepts. Chemistry laboratory educational activities are shown to be less effective in developing an optimum conceptual understanding and HOTS among students. One factor is a lack of effective assessment and evaluation tools. Therefore, the primary focus of this study is to explore concept maps as an assessment tool in order to move students' thinking skills to a higher level during laboratory learning activities. An embedded mixed method design is used in this study, which has also employed a pre-experimental research design. This design triangulates quantitative and qualitative data, which are combined to strengthen the findings. A low-directed concept mapping technique, convergence scoring method, and pre-post laboratory concept map were used in this study. An electrolysis HOTS test was used as the research instrument in order to measure the level of student achievement with respect to high-level questions. In addition, the thought process that is involved when students construct concept maps has been explored and studied in detail by utilising a think-aloud protocol. Results showed a positive development towards understanding and higher level thinking skills in students with respect to electrolysis concepts learned through chemistry laboratory activities. An investigation of the students' thinking processes showed that high-achieving students were more capable of giving a content-based explanation of electrolysis and engaged in monitoring activities more often while building a concept map. Nonetheless, all categories of students managed to show a positive increase in the activities of explanation and monitoring during the construction of concept maps after they were exposed to the assessment tool in the laboratory learning activities. In conclusion, the assessment activity using concept maps in laboratory learning activities has a positive impact on students' understanding and stimulates students to increase their HOTS. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - With the increasing number of ontologies being designed to represent and manage knowledge in all sorts of sectors, ontology alignment and integration become more and more important in aggregating intelligent efforts on homogenous and heterogeneous data. From the computational perspective, it is challenging due to the ubiquitous existence of diverse classifications of same data. In this paper, we propose an active ontology integration and alignment system, which plugs in expandable learning reference context pool. In the reference context pool, we have integrated WordNet, MeSH, and external curated mapping sources (ICD9 to SNOMEDCT) with an extension to injecting UMLS. The active ontology integration and alignment system takes account of not only subsumption tree but also directed acyclic graph underlying ontologies. It allows 1) finding exact one-to-one matching terms of pairwise ontologies, 2) finding inexact one-to-one term mappings, where two terms have at least a concept in common on basis of the lexical context, and 3) finding one-to-many concept mappings, where one concept can be lexically mapped to the combination of multiple exclusive concepts. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - This study focuses on how teachers learn to teach a new topic and the role played by their developing content knowledge as they teach. The paper is based on seven high school science teachers’ studies on the teaching of semiconductors, at the time a new topic in the curriculum. Analysis of artefacts such as teacher concept maps, video recordings of lessons, journals and other classroom-based evidence shows how the extent and type of teachers’ content knowledge informed their choice of teaching approaches and how their learning of content took place alongside the development of teaching strategies. The development of content knowledge was combined with increased understanding of how to teach the topic in almost all cases. Evidence of development of teachers’ PCK was found in their increased ability to design teaching strategies, and their use of representations and suitable assessment tasks for their lessons. Some specific common teaching strategies were identified across the teachers. These strategies could add to the canon of teachers’ topic - specific professional knowledge for semiconductors. The study provides increased understanding of how teachers simultaneously master content and its teaching and how mediated self-reflection is a fruitful approach for assisting teachers to learn to teach a new topic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Scaffolds in games have the potential to facilitate learning effects in addition to assisting the gaming process. However, studies on game-based science learning usually only adopt questionnaires to evaluate scientific concepts, and use interviews or observations to assess problem solving ability, neglecting the importance of investigating game-making outcomes. We customized a digital game, “Crayon Physics Deluxe,” with varied scaffolding designs to evaluate their effects on science learning. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, marking critical features scaffolding, and the no-game group. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and design creativity (in the form of game episode designs). Students were asked to transform their roles from problem solvers to problem designers, which might not only demonstrate their ability to solve scientific problems, but also develop their creativity potential in designing scientific puzzles. The results indicated that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and the sensitivity dimension of design creativity, while the group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of design creativity. These findings suggest that proper scaffolds could be designed to function as learning scaffolds rather than just as gaming scaffolds, and different learning purposes require various scaffolding designs. The content of the scaffolds, as well as the timing of their provision should be carefully designed according to the game features to achieve specific instructional purposes. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction. © 2016, International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society.

AB  - In this study, Turkish prospective elementary science teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis and cellular respiration has been analysed within the contexts of ecosystem knowledge, organism knowledge and interconnection knowledge (IK). In the analysis, concept maps developed by 74 prospective teachers were used. The study was carried out with prospective teachers in their final year who were enrolled in the special teaching methods course. The results show that prospective teachers’ understanding of photosynthesis, cellular respiration, energy flow and matter cycling is quite different from one another’s. In addition, the present study revealed that prospective elementary science teachers showed weak understanding of energy flow and matter, cycling and cellular respiration concepts and IK category but they had strong understanding of photosynthesis concept. Prospective teachers also experience difficulties in understanding connections between macro- and microbiological systems. The study concludes with suggestions for more meaningful biology education. © 2016 Royal Society of Biology.

AB  - In recent years collaborative concept mapping (CCM) has become a very useful didactic teaching tool for teaching and learning about different topics. It engages the student in active learning and helps him to organize his ideas. The main objective of this study was to investigate the effect of using CCM on university students’ learning achievement in two subjects: ethical principles and deontology in university (EPDU) and Physics. 64 students from faculty of sciences participated in this research. All students in our sample took courses in EPDU and physics, at formal situation. Students were randomly divided into two groups; experimental and control groups. The students in the experimental groups constructed CCM at the end of each lesson. Meanwhile, the control groups were taught by just traditional teaching strategies. All groups took multiple choice learning achievement tests. No significant difference was found between groups which took courses on EPDU. While, a significant difference in favour of the experimental group, where CCM after conventional teaching methods was applied to learn physics, has been observed. The results support that when students are constructed CCM in a scientific subject like physics, they achieve the best scores. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - Science teachers need to help students identify their prior ideas and modify them based on scientific knowledge. This process is called as conceptual change. One of essential tools to analyze students' conceptual change is by using concept map. Concept Maps are graphical representations of knowledge that are comprised of concepts and the relationships between them. Constructing concept map is implemented by adapting the role of technology to support learning process, as it is suitable with Educational Ministry Regulation No.68 year 2013. Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC) has developed CmapTools, a client-server software for easily construct and visualize concept maps. This research aims to investigate secondary students' conceptual change after experiencing five-stage conceptual teaching model by utilizing CmapTools in learning Optics. Weak experimental method through one group pretest-posttest design is implemented in this study to collect preliminary and post concept map as qualitative data. Sample was taken purposively of 8th grade students (n= 22) at one of private schools Bandung, West Java. Conceptual change based on comparison of preliminary and post concept map construction is assessed based on rubric of concept map scoring and structure. Results shows significance conceptual change differences at 50.92 % that is elaborated into concept map element such as prepositions and hierarchical level in high category, cross links in medium category and specific examples in low category. All of the results are supported with the students' positive response towards CmapTools utilization that indicates improvement of motivation, interest, and behavior aspect towards Physics lesson. © 2017 Author(s).

We also propose to utilize the same framework for clinical concept prediction to improve caption generation by formulating the task as a case of sequence-to-sequence learning. The predicted concept IDs are then mapped to corresponding terms in a clinical ontology to generate an image caption. We also investigate if learning to classify images based on the modality e.g. CT scan, MRI etc. can aid in generating precise captions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2018.

AB  - Teaching biology is characterized by a great number of concepts and facts. It is very difficult to concisely represent all important concepts and facts. In order to effectively present important concepts such as pollination and pollinators, concept maps have been applied. In particular, the pedagogical experiment was applied to determine whether the concept maps are effective as teaching technology compared to the usual teaching approach without this technology. The research involved 110 elementary school students who were divided into one experimental (E) and one control (C) group. The E group covered programme content related to pollination and pollinators by applying concept maps. The C group was exposed to the same content, without these maps. It is evidenced a difference of the attained knowledge in favour of the experimental group after the introduction of the experimental factor (application of concept maps). The application of concept maps directly contributed to better learning and knowledge acquisition in teaching the biology content Pollination and Pollinators. Based upon the obtained results of this research, concept maps will be further implemented to improve teaching process and the teachers will be gradually trained for the application of this teaching technology. © 2017, Scientific Methodical Center.

AB  - Underpinned by a holistic, dynamic, and process-oriented view of teacher competences, this study provides an analytic hierarchy system of instructional design competence (IDC) for evaluating teachers' IDC based on the mental model of instructional design. Additionally, this study quantitatively explores the IDC characteristics and correlations of 118 preservice science teachers at Shanxi Normal University in China, who learned the ADTRE (analyzing, designing, teaching, revising, and evaluating/improving) instructional model, based on reflection and feedback. Using lesson planning (LP) scoring rubrics, we analyzed 113 lesson plans from 56 participants majoring in biological science and 57 in biological technology. We present the ADTRE model and discuss relationships between preservice science teachers' academic achievement and IDC. Major findings include a positive correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC scores and their course grades in Advanced Mathematics and Cell Biology and concept mapping skills. There was a negative correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC and course grades in Principles of Genetic Engineering and Technology, and no significant correlations existed between IDC and course grades for teacher education courses. Our findings reveal the nature of preservice science teachers' IDC, a potential for improvement in university teacher education curricula, and a need for further research. © Authors.

AB  - Purpose of Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of pre-service biology teachers’ metaconceptual processes that were active as they participated in metaconceptual teaching activities. Methods: Several instructional activities, including poster drawing, concept mapping, group and class discussions, and journal writing, were carried out to activate the metaconceptual processes of 32 secondgrade, pre-service biology teachers in order to change their alternative conceptions regarding seed plants. Case study was used as a research method. Among the 32 participants, five participants who activated five participants who activated rich and diverse metaconceptual processes and who reflected well and clearly on their mental processes in their journals were selected for the case study. The journal entries written by these five students before, during, and after the teaching activities were used as a data source. Content analysis was used to code the journals of the preservice teachers according to the types and the content of metaconceptual processes. Results and Conclusions: The results indicated that students engaged in several types of metaconceptual activities, which can be classified under metaconceptual awareness, metaconceptual monitoring, and metaconceptual evaluation. Metaconceptual processes were activated interdependently in different forms, ranging from simpler first-order metaconceptual awareness to more sophisticated metaconceptual evaluations. Recommendations: In designing metaconceptual teaching activities, teachers should take the interdependent and multifaceted nature of these processes into consideration. © 2017 Ani Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Advance organizer strategies based on cognitive theories have been found to have an impact on learning in the early studies. However, recent studies have found inconclusive results when type and format of the advance organizers were taken into account. This study investigated the impact of different formats of advance organizers (graphic with text explanation, voice narration, and concept map) on learners understanding of science concepts. A total of 136 high school students participated in this study. A factorial design was utilized for the experiment using format of advance organizers as the independent variable while learners achievement on retention and transfer test regarding the learning content as the dependent variables.

AB  - An attempt has been made to study the effectiveness of concept maps in physics education through quasi-experimental design. The post-test is used as a measuring instrument and the post-test scores are statistically analysed. The results of Levene's test and t-test reveal that mean of post-test scores of the experimental and control groups are statistically significant. This confirms the Alternate Hypothesis that students who studied using concept maps (experimental group) attained higher learning compared to the students who did not use the concept maps (control group). The learner achievement score reveals that 17.7 % higher learning has been attained by experimental group compared with control group. Questionnaires were used to know the students perceptions on the use of concept maps. The results of questionnaire analysis showed that students find concept maps are useful in teaching and learning. Further details of this study are discussed in the article. © 2017 IEEE.

AB  - To date, the standard quantitative questionnaire has been the 'go to' instrument for measuring impacts of space-related Education and Public Outreach (EPO). Although these instruments are well established, easy and inexpensive ways to measure large samples of participants, researchers in the field of EPO are increasingly pointing to the need for more sensitive instruments to evaluate the impacts of outreach efforts [1, 2]. We report on the development of a new instrument-a digital game-designed to measure the effectiveness of space EPO activities in achieving their scientific literacy objectives. The instrument uses choice-based assessment and Teachable Agents (TA) in a game-like interactive digital application. Choice-based assessment, developed by the Stanford Graduate School of Education, measures learning by evaluating the choices a participant makes, rather than their knowledge [3]. Also developed by Stanford Graduate School of Education, a Teachable Agent (TA) is a learning technology that uses the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent by creating a concept map that serves as the agent's 'brain'[3]. This game-like instrument measures the choices (concept maps) that participants make in 'teaching' their TA about the nature of science and scientific process. We can then use it to measure any changes in participant choices after participating in space EPO. The concept map components and concepts available to participants in the game, as well as related assessment scales, derive from various existing instruments that have been tested for reliability and validity, including: the Student Understanding of Science and Scientific Inquiry (SUSSI) questionnaire [4] and the Trust in Science and Scientists (TSSI) questionnaire [5]. Demographic questions about participants' gender, age, level of education, level of science education and area of work are also included in the instrument. Copyright © 2017 by I. Kingsley.

AB  - Introduction: The concept map (CM) is a teaching technique that aids learning and its assessment Originally used in general education, it was introduced in therapeutic patient education (TPE) in 2004. Aims: To describe and analyse the use of concept mapping in TPE ten years after its introduction. Methods: Analysis of the literature from 2004 to 2014 using the following databases and search engines: ScienceDirect, Google Scholar, PubMed, EM-Premium, PsycINFO, OpenGrey, Sudoc, ERIC and JSTOR. Results: Twenty-seven documents were analyzed. Twenty-one of these reported studies or practical experiences in France. The maps were used in TPE for different groups having a variety of conditions, mainly for the purpose of diagnostic and training assessments (23/27), and less commonly as a learning aid (4/27). Several methods for use were identified: construction by the patient, by the educator, as a group or individually. The authors described the benefits of each method. The effects and educational potential of concept mapping were discussed. Conclusion: Despite the limited number of publications, this literature analysis confirms the value of concept maps in TPE. However, their use, which is still limited, will depend on whether caregiver-educators see a place for them and are trained to use them. © EDP Sciences, SETE, 2015.

AB  - We present a framework for constructing a specific type of knowledge graph, a concept map from textbooks. Using Wikipedia, we derive prerequisite relations among these concepts. A traditional approach for concept map extraction consists of two sub-problems: key concept extraction and concept relationship identification. Previous work for the most part had considered these two sub-problems independently. We propose a framework that jointly optimizes these sub-problems and investigates methods that identify concept relationships. Experiments on concept maps that are manually extracted in six educational areas (computer networks, macroeconomics, precalculus, databases, physics, and geometry) show that our model outperforms supervised learning baselines that solve the two sub-problems separately. Moreover, we observe that incorporating textbook information helps with concept map extraction. © 2016 ACM.

AB  - Users learning to concept map often confront the problem of when is it that their concept map is complete. They ask the question “Is my concept map large enough?”. As they progress in their understanding of concept maps, users often stop asking themselves whether the concept map is the appropriate size, which is key when using concept maps as means to communicate and share knowledge. In this paper we examine what factors need to be taken into account when determining the proper size for a concept map, and examine the importance of the purpose of the concept map and its intended audience. The stages through which a new Cmapper goes are also examining, and propose that to reach a Level 3 Excellent Cmapper, the question to be asked is “Is my concept map small enough?”. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - The amount of substance and its unit the mole is a basic concept in chemistry. However, previous research has shown that teaching and learning the concept are challenging tasks for both teachers and students. The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the problems which emerge in the teaching and learning process, and provide integrated suggestions for classroom instruction. By means of videotaping and interviews, the case studies explored how the mole is presented and conceptualized in two secondary classrooms in two different countries, Australia and Taiwan. Data analysis was based on a concept map and focused on how two key ideas were presented in the lessons and perceived by the students: (1) the definition of the mole, and (2) the concept of molar mass. The findings show that during the lessons on the mole, most of the time was spent on solving stoichiometric problems. Conceptually, the number aspect of the mole, that is, Avogadro's number, was emphasized; the concept of molar mass was introduced without meaningfully connecting it to the concept of relative atomic/molecular mass. Although the students were able to solve relevant problems, they could not coherently explain the relations among the concepts. Two critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole emerged: (1) the number aspect of the mole needs to be justified by its mass aspect, and (2) the connection between molar mass and relative atomic/molecular mass needs to be explicitly explained. The two components provide one explanation for students' algorithmic learning and their confusion in learning about the mole, and serve as concrete suggestions for improving classroom instruction. The study once again manifested the significance of teaching for conceptual understanding in science education. It also exemplifies how a concept map of a specific scientific concept can also be a useful analytical tool in educational research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Spatial representations have been considered for their high didactical efficacy, as concept maps and mind maps. Graphical and spatial representations may be seen as key elements of knowledge management and may contribute to enhancing spatial knowledge. Even if isomorphisms between the physical and the mental dimension can be controversial in the field of spatial knowledge, it is nevertheless interesting to study the role of spatial interpretation in knowledge management processes. In science education, spatial skills are actually highly required due to the development of new technologies and their highly demanding spatial tasks they often work intertwined with other abilities, such as logical reasoning and verbal skills. Despite spatial knowledge being significative in the overall field of learning management, there is instead little research that shows its complex role in the comprehension of concepts in the humanistic fields, e.g. in philosophical conceptual reasoning. The Elementary Logic Theory—which underlies the philosophical maps of this Atlas—identifies at the basis of complex thinking prototypical knowledge units that may be activated in the possible collaboration between explicit and implicit thinking. In EL Theory, spatiality is considered the most suitable transition format for the hypothesized collaboration between implicit and explicit processing because it shares common aspects with both of them. The focus of EL Theory is to research particularly the role of the implicit in knowledge comprehension through spatial representations. In this Atlas, the role of Elementary Logic Theory is highlighted in shaping philosophical knowledge and comprehension of philosophical concepts and their intertwining. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Tendinopathy is a multifactorial syndrome characterised by tendon pain and thickening, and impaired performance during activity. Candidate gene association studies have identified genetic factors that contribute to intrinsic risk of developing tendinopathy upon exposure to extrinsic factors. Bioinformatics approaches that data-mine existing knowledge for biological relationships may assist with the identification of candidate genes. The aim of this study was to data-mine functional annotation of human genes and identify candidate genes by ontology-seeded queries capturing the features of tendinopathy. Our BioOntological Relationship Graph database (BORG) integrates multiple sources of genomic and biomedical knowledge into an on-disk semantic network where human genes and their orthologs in mouse and rat are central concepts mapped to ontology terms. The BORG was used to screen all human genes for potential links to tendinopathy. Following further prioritisation, four strong candidate genes (COL11A2, ELN, ITGB3, LOX) were identified. These genes are differentially expressed in tendinopathy, functionally linked to features of tendinopathy and previously implicated in other connective tissue diseases. In conclusion, cross-domain semantic integration of multiple sources of biomedical knowledge, and interrogation of phenotypes and gene functions associated with disease, may significantly increase the probability of identifying strong and unobvious candidate genes in genetic association studies.

AB  - The green chemistry course taught at Westminster College (PA) incorporates nontraditional teaching techniques and texts to educate future chemists about the importance of using green chemistry principles. The course is designed to introduce green chemistry concepts and demonstrate their inherent necessity by discussing historical missteps by the chemical industry, and future design possibilities. Students learn to apply green chemistry principles through case studies and journal article activities, while connecting all of these resources and experiences with concept maps. The final course project requires students to create their own green chemistry educational materials. This nontraditional approach to teaching chemistry provides an opportunity for students to learn in dynamic ways and to be creative in their contributions to green chemistry. © 2015 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - The term sustainability is over-used and often misused in society. Further, sustainability and sustainable engineering are complex topics. This research explored how first year engineering students define these complex ideas, and the impacts of two different instructional methods on their ideas. Sustainability knowledge was evaluated using concept maps. Students' initial ideas about sustainability were explored based on concept maps that individual students generated in-class. This was followed by two different instruction methods. Civil and architectural engineering students in a two-credit first year introduction to engineering course learned about sustainable engineering rating systems in a two-week module; they repeated the concept map as part of the graded homework assignment on sustainability. This course was compared to a 1-credit seminar-style introductory sustainability course that focused on the social sciences aspects of sustainability over the whole semester via a series of readings and in-class discussions; these seminar students repeated the concept map as part of their final exam. The concept maps were scored by counting the number of individual concepts, cross-links, and highest hierarchy; these metrics were also combined into a total weighted score. Beyond these basic quantitative measures, the distribution of sustainability concepts across the three pillars of environmental, social, and economic issues was also determined. The in-class "pre" concept maps showed significant variability in students' sustainability knowledge, ranging from 3 to 34 concepts, 0 to 16 cross-links, hierarchical depth of 1 to 7, and total scores of 9 to 192. Students in both the civil & architectural engineering class (n=72) and the sustainability seminar course (n=44) had improved sustainability concept maps after instruction. Categorical scoring found that environmental aspects comprised the highest percentage of the concepts on both the pre- and post-instruction concept maps. However, the post-instruction concept maps in both courses had significantly higher percentages of both social and economic aspects compared to the preconcept maps. This indicates that students achieved both a richer and a more balanced understanding of sustainability. There were somewhat larger increases in the number of social and economic concepts on the concept maps of students in the sustainability seminar course as compared to the civil & architectural engineering course. This difference was expected based on the focus and greater depth of sustainability instruction in the seminar course. The concept maps seemed useful to judge the success of different instructional methods, and provided an assessment of students' sustainability knowledge. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB  - Technology-orientation and coding are gaining momentum in Finnish curriculum planning for primary and secondary school. However, according to the existing plans, the scope of ICT teaching is limited to practical topics, e.g., how to drill basic control structures (if-then-else, for, while) without focusing on the high level epistemological view of ICT. This paper proposes some key extensions to such plans, targeted to highlight rather the epistemological factors of teaching than talk about concrete means of strengthening the craftsmanship of coding. The proposed approach stems from the qualitative data collected by interviewing ICT professionals (N=7, 4 males, 3 females), who have gained experience of the industry needs while working as ICT professionals (avg=11.3 y, s=3.9 y). This work illustrates a holistic model of ICT teaching as well as suggests a set of new methods and tools.

AB  - Digital games have become a popular source of entertainment. The main reason that players continue to play video games is that the game designers use scaffolding to bridge the gap between a player's current skills and those needed to be successful at the next level. Several mainstream digital games have the flexibility to become promising game-based learning environments, in which scaffolding could play a crucial role to improve the learning experience. This study examines the effectiveness of providing instructors with the opportunity to tailor a digital game in order to meet their personal teaching goals. The built-in game features in Crayon Physics Deluxe are blended with instructor-designed scaffolding to see whether such features can assist learning without impeding creativity. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups. In three of the groups, Crayon Physics Deluxe was used with varied scaffolding conditions: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, and marking critical features scaffolding. The fourth group did not play the game. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and creativity performance (in the form of game episode designs). The results show that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and in the sensitivity dimension of design creativity. The group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of creativity when designing their own game episodes. These findings suggest that proper scaffolding does facilitate learning, and different learning purposes require various designs of scaffoldings. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers’ misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention. Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky’s theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness. Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers’ understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention. Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers’ did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers’ prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction: A translational bioinformatics challenge exists in connecting population and individual clinical phenotypes in various formats to biological mechanisms. The Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA®) is the default dictionary for adverse event (AE) reporting in the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS). The ontology of adverse events (OAE) represents AEs as pathological processes occurring after drug exposures. Objectives: The aim of this work was to establish a semantic framework to link biological mechanisms to phenotypes of AEs by combining OAE with MedDRA® in FAERS data analysis. We investigated the AEs associated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting tyrosine kinases. The five selected TKIs/mAbs (i.e., dasatinib, imatinib, lapatinib, cetuximab, and trastuzumab) are known to induce impaired ventricular function (non-QT) cardiotoxicity. Results: Statistical analysis of FAERS data identified 1053 distinct MedDRA® terms significantly associated with TKIs/mAbs, where 884 did not have corresponding OAE terms. We manually annotated these terms, added them to OAE by the standard OAE development strategy, and mapped them to MedDRA®. The data integration to provide insights into molecular mechanisms of drug-associated AEs was performed by including linkages in OAE for all related AE terms to MedDRA® and the existing ontologies, including the human phenotype ontology (HP), Uber anatomy ontology (UBERON), and gene ontology (GO). Sixteen AEs were shared by all five TKIs/mAbs, and each of 17 cardiotoxicity AEs was associated with at least one TKI/mAb. As an example, we analyzed “cardiac failure” using the relations established in OAE with other ontologies and demonstrated that one of the biological processes associated with cardiac failure maps to the genes associated with heart contraction. Conclusion: By expanding the existing OAE ontological design, our TKI use case demonstrated that the combination of OAE and MedDRA® provides a semantic framework to link clinical phenotypes of adverse drug events to biological mechanisms. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland (Outside the USA).

AB  - Concept maps have recently been widely applied to pedagogical tasks, such as eliciting the acquired knowledge of students or scaffolding their online inquiry with a knowledge structure. Moreover, there is a growing need to develop an assistance mechanism that supports concept map construction due to the increasing volume of learning resources available online. The aim of this study is to develop a query expansion-based approach to assist students in efficiently retrieving appropriate knowledge from the Internet and constructing more comprehensive concept maps. The validity of the proposed approach is measured through a comparison of its results of a food web construction with those from a biology textbook. It is demonstrated that the proposed approach can provide sound results that are close to expert skeleton concept maps. The fndings show that query expansion can help expand search queries, and can serve as a great source of inspiration for the construction of comprehensive concept maps.

AB  - In this paper the authors describe how the use of multiple methods of qualitative data collection over a two-year period, including interviews, concept maps and journals, and the analysis of data through visual inquiry, categorizing (constant comparison thematic analysis), and connecting (narrative analysis) provided a more comprehensive understanding of the process of evolution in college teachers’ perspectives on teaching and learning within a professional development program than would have emerged with only a single method. Concept maps provided an initial visual footprint of teachers’ emerging perspectives. Categorization revealed four major patterns across teachers’ perspectives. Connecting the data through narrative summaries exposed a contextualized rendition of aspects of individual teachers’ perspectives. Each of these three approaches offers a unique lens into qualitative data analysis, and when used together, they clarify important aspects of the phenomenon under investigation. © 2016: Susan Kerwin-Boudreau, Lynn Butler-Kisber, and Nova Southeastern University.

AB  - In this paper, we explore the use of concept maps (Cmaps) as instructional materials prepared by teachers, to foster the understanding of chemistry. We choose fireworks as a macroscopic event to teach basic chemical principles related to the Bohr atomic model and matter-energy interaction. During teachers' Cmap navigation, students can experience a sense of disorientation, which is detrimental to the learning process. Two graphical cues were tested as Cmap navigation guidance: (1) colour-coded concepts, to group similar content and (2) numbered propositions to offer a reading sequence. A quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test design combined with mental effort was utilized to measure the efficiency of Cmaps in learning. First-year undergraduate students (n = 85) were randomly assigned to study one of four possible Cmaps. The results showed that all students were able to increase their level of factual knowledge, despite the Cmap being used as an instructional material. The lack of cues impaired conceptual understanding. Signalling similar content using colours was critical to reduce the invested mental effort and foster understanding about chemical concepts. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have yielded satisfactory results and prompted students’ curiosity and interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently, whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn. © 2016, De La Salle University.

AB  - This work in progress paper presents the preliminary step towards developing a new educational framework titled "Tracking Evolution Architecture of Cognitive Hierarchy Maps for Engaged Classrooms" (TEACH ME). In this paper, we track the scaffolding of the pre-requisites needed in high school level physics concepts and use this information to design the higher-level scaffolding of the same concepts in a university freshmen physics course. This tracking is performed as a meta-cognitive activity inside the classrooms, using a well-established concept visualization tool called "concept maps". Further, these maps will be extended to include higher-level concepts in the engineering courses that have the physics course as a pre-requisite. This paper presents the insights from a pilot implementation of this technique in a freshman physics course. We used concept map as an additional instruction method to aid the students to visually connect the pre-requisite and the newly delivered concepts. This will allow students to understand what they know and what they need to learn. The effectiveness of this method is measured using the data collected from class quizzes and tests. The paper summarizes the initial results from this study along with a discussion on how such earlier maps developed at freshmen level can be extended to higher-level engineering classes for creating engaged classrooms using a novel teaching-learning frame work under development titled "Tracking Evolution Architecture of Cognitive Hierarchy Maps for Engaged Classrooms" (TEACH ME). © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to apply concept mapping to the design of an interdisciplinary approach for teaching middle school science. The study was centered around the question: What does it mean for pre-service teacher candidates to plan an integrated instructional unit using content from different science disciplines taught in middle school grades? The study required preservice teachers to (through their own understanding of science, math, and literacy content) be able to identify with an authentic real-world scenario and apply core elements to the design of an interdisciplinary approach to lesson planning, classroom instruction, and student assessment. Designing the unit involved the use of concept maps to visualize and communicate essential pedagogical elements and their relationships to each other. Analysis of pre-service teacher candidate concept maps provided a fluid basis for peer-learning, facilitated co-planning, and created a context for next level content understanding. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - As the rapid development of technology and the popularity of computer equipments, Computer aided learning makes learning effective and interesting through the use of interactive multimedia technology. In the past decade, augmented reality has become an popular technology and has widely utilized in many researches. Many researchers have integrated AR technology into multimedia instructional practices, increasing instructional flexibility and interaction. However, most of augmented reality learning system didn't have the learning scaffold or method to support learning activity, and often been designed from the perspective of developers, without considering the instructors' instructional progress and methods. Therefore, this study proposed an concept-mapping augmented reality learning system whose architecture and implementation are detailed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed system, a questionnaire was given to 36 eleven years old students after their hands-on experience with the system. Results of the questionnaire showed that the proposed AR learning system support students a motivating, pleasant, and satisfying learning experience. Limitation, conclusion and future studies are given.

AB  - Much research has been done on the application of concept maps as means for learning assessment. Similarly, different types of Concept-Map Based Assessments (CMBA) and their validity have been examined as well in many studies, but to a far less extent. The present study uses a descriptive quantitative method and mainly aims to put forward the idea that the select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept maps could be used as a valid instrument to assess the conceptual understanding of science among thermodynamics students. For this purpose, the concurrent validity of the SAFI concept map was evaluated according to the last version of the Thermodynamic Concept Survey (TCS) in order to develop a standard conceptual survey in thermodynamics. The TCS has a total KR-20 of approximately 0.78, an acceptable value, which could be employed as a valid test to assess teacher-made SAFI concept maps. The study population includes 60 students from two physics classes. An evaluation of the conceptual understandings of thermodynamics students were made concurrently using two assessment tools. Based on the study findings, there is a moderate to strong correlation (0.6) between the Teacher-made SAFI concept map and TCS. This leads us to the conclusion that SAFI concept maps are valid tools, at least, for evaluating conceptual understanding in thermodynamics. Moreover, the results of this study are confirmed a significant relationship between a student’s ability to read and comprehend a given question and his/her ability to solve it. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Aim and objectives: To examine how nurses collect and use cues from respiratory assessment to inform their decisions as they wean patients from ventilatory support. Background: Prompt and accurate identification of the patient's ability to sustain reduction of ventilatory support has the potential to increase the likelihood of successful weaning. Nurses' information processing during the weaning from mechanical ventilation has not been well-described. Design: A descriptive ethnographic study exploring critical care nurses' decision-making processes when weaning mechanically ventilated patients from ventilatory support in the real setting. Methods: Novice and expert Scottish and Greek nurses from two tertiary intensive care units were observed in real practice of weaning mechanical ventilation and were invited to participate in reflective interviews near the end of their shift. Data were analysed thematically using concept maps based on information processing theory. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. Results: Scottish and Greek critical care nurses acquired patient-centred objective physiological and subjective information from respiratory assessment and previous knowledge of the patient, which they clustered around seven concepts descriptive of the patient's ability to wean. Less experienced nurses required more encounters of cues to attain the concepts with certainty. Subjective criteria were intuitively derived from previous knowledge of patients' responses to changes of ventilatory support. All nurses used focusing decision-making strategies to select and group cues in order to categorise information with certainty and reduce the mental strain of the decision task. Conclusions: Nurses used patient-centred information to make a judgment about the patients' ability to wean. Decision-making strategies that involve categorisation of patient-centred information can be taught in bespoke educational programmes for mechanical ventilation and weaning. Relevance to clinical practice: Advanced clinical reasoning skills and accurate detection of cues in respiratory assessment by critical care nurses will ensure optimum patient management in weaning mechanical ventilation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

AB  - In secondary science education, the learning and teaching of coherent conceptual understanding are often problematic. Context-based education has been proposed as a partial solution to this problem. This study aims to gain insight into the development of conceptual coherence and how context-embedded learning-teaching activities (LT) can promote this. We describe a case study in which a context-based lesson sequence about protein-rich food production was designed and conducted in a 10th-grade biology class. The conceptual framework consisted of transformations of forms of energy and matter in photosynthesis, cellular respiration, and biosynthesis. All relevant concepts and their interconnections (propositions) were captured in a reference concept map. A research scenario was used to evaluate whether the lesson sequence was conducted as intended. Learning outcomes were determined by analyzing written products on the occurrence of propositions from the reference concept map. Additional interviews provided insight into the development of conceptual coherence in relation to three context-embedded LT activities: using graphic visualizations, writing, and concept mapping. The results indicated that students improved in mentioning propositions from the reference concept map. Propositions relating metabolic processes and including forms of energy were still difficult. Finally, successful elements of the three LT activities are considered. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc..

AB  - Background: Enhancing students’ metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts. Purpose: The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students’ metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science. Sample: A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study. Design and methods: The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him. In order to enhance the students’ metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire (MSpQ) and the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire (MStQ), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light. Results: The results showed gains in the MSpQ but not in the MStQ. However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test. Conclusion: Although the quantitative data obtained from the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire did not show significant gains in the students’ metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students’ metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire showed that there were significant gains in the students’ perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students’ achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Empirical analysis of secondary biology classrooms revealed that, on average, 68% of teaching time in Germany revolved around processing tasks. Quality of instruction can thus be assessed by analyzing the quality of tasks used in classroom discourse. This quasi-experimental study analyzed how teachers used tasks in 38 videotaped biology lessons pertaining to the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’. Two fundamental characteristics used to analyze tasks include: (1) required cognitive level of processing (e.g. low level information processing: repetiition, summary, define, classify and high level information processing: interpret-analyze data, formulate hypothesis, etc.) and (2) complexity of task content (e.g. if tasks require use of factual, linking or concept level content). Additionally, students’ cognitive knowledge structure about the topic ‘blood and circulatory system’ was measured using student-drawn concept maps (N = 970 students). Finally, linear multilevel models were created with high-level cognitive processing tasks and higher content complexity tasks as class-level predictors and students’ prior knowledge, students’ interest in biology, and students’ interest in biology activities as control covariates. Results showed a positive influence of high-level cognitive processing tasks (β = 0.07; p <.01) on students’ cognitive knowledge structure. However, there was no observed effect of higher content complexity tasks on students’ cognitive knowledge structure. Presented findings encourage the use of high-level cognitive processing tasks in biology instruction. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - A value-centered approach to science, technology and society (STS) education illuminates the need of reflexive and relational learning through communication and public engagement. Visualization is a key to represent and compare mental models such as assumptions, background theories and value systems that tacitly shape our own understanding, interests and interactions. Yet conventional approaches including concept mapping and multi-criteria value elicitation methods often have little suggestion or implication as to how participants themselves can address and deliberate the incompatibility of their perceptions, preferences and perspectives. This study proposes Q workshop as a legitimate eliciting and deliberation technique that can be employed in pluralistic discourse, exploring systematic divergences of perspective by constructing the participant‘s self in a formative, emergent and contingent manner. For this it introduces Q mapping as a novel visualization tool for the hybridity of qualitative and quantitative methods derived from Q methodology. Q mapping is a two-factor solution that transforms the similarities in participants’ individual Q scores into distances represented in two-dimensional space, for the sake of illustrating the relative positioning and partitioning of perspectives in a schematic figure. A case study on STS education for postgraduate students demonstrates that Q workshop can play a heuristic and abductive role in providing independent illumination of distinguishable perspectives and facilitating individual and collective learning among participants, suggesting a schematic two-dimensional basis for resolving the key differences. © 2016 The Author.

AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (n =19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (n =23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This article seeks to reflect on the teaching and practice of the use of conceptual modeling that can assist the teaching-learning process of students in the classes of Geography in schools of the educational system of the State of Piauí (Brazil). This research was developed with Geography teachers in a training course for teachers for the use of Geotechnologies and Tools of Web interaction within the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Piauí (Brazil). As found by the analysis of data collected in this investigation, teachers agree that conceptual modeling contributes to the organization of the geographic knowledge of students. And yet it was evident the use of concept maps as a teaching and learning strategy, as well as an evaluation tool for student performance. Finally, the use of concept maps in teaching Geography brings up the idea of the development and exercise of autonomy by the students, since self-study is one of the essential factors for meaningful learning of spatial content in classroom.

AB  - The authors, professors in civil engineering, teach multiple sections of a required introduction to engineering course at Lafayette College. The course has general student learning outcomes that apply to multiple areas of engineering (e.g., civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, etc.) and were developed by consensus of the engineering departments at the institution. In addition to these general student learning outcomes, more specific student learning outcomes are incorporated into individual sections of the course. These outcomes are developed by the individual faculty member teaching the section and may be related to his/her disciplinary expertise. The courses that serve as the foundation for the work presented in this paper have student learning outcomes associated with civil engineering. Because of the general nature of most introduction to engineering courses, comparison of assessment outcomes across different course sections can be difficult, and that difficulty can hinder productive discussions across disciplines and the development of recommendations for course improvements. We have used a simple concept map assignment, given on the first and last day of each course, to evaluate student learning outcomes and as a basis for analysis of multiple sections of the course within civil engineering and the development of recommendations for course improvements in that area. The work presented in this paper is anticipated to serve as the foundation for a future project assessing sections of the course across multiple engineering areas. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB  - Concept maps are effective tools for showing the relations between the concepts and they can be used to make clear the relations between the abstract concepts such as hydrocarbons topic. The aim of this research is to determine the abilities of prospective chemistry teachers’ (PCTs) creating concept maps about hydrocarbons. In this research, case study was used and the study was carried out in a university in North Coast of Turkey with 25 PCTs (aged 20-27). PCTs were taught how to create concept maps, types of concept maps such as hierarchical, non- hierarchical and chain or spoke concept maps through example concept maps. In this research context, PCTs were given a text about hydrocarbons and they were supposed to prepare their own concept maps about hydrocarbons. Their concept maps were evaluated according to the reference concept map which was prepared by the researchers. At the end of the research, it is seen that PCTs had difficulty in constructing concept maps. According to the conclusions drawn from the research, some suggestions were offered. © 2016, Scientific Methodical Center. All rights reserved.

AB  - Preserving important troubleshooting experience gained in industrial practice, often referred to as "tribal knowledge", and making it readily available to be re-applied in similar situations represent a serious challenge for many companies in heavy industry. The solution is very often tied to building mental models to capture and express key latent cognitive variables. In this paper, we first attempt to identify the appropriate knowledge-based system diagnosis paradigms. A conceptual map-based framework is then proposed as a potential solution for retaining tribal knowledge. The validity and feasibility of the approach are demonstrated through a training program developed under the support of National Science Foundation (NSF) for improving engineering and technology students' troubleshooting skills. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - In this study it was aimed to investigate cognitive structures of pre-service science teachers in some basic chemistry terms via word association test. Data were analyzed according to the number of responses to each key word in the word association test and concept maps were drawn according to frequencies as well as relatedness coefficient. Results of this study showed that participants’ strongest part of cognitive structures within the given keywords was “compound-molecule” relation and they have weaknesses/difficulties in “ion” concept. It can be said that the abstract feature of the given concepts and the difficulties on understanding of macro and micro relations were effective on these results. Besides, according to sentence analysis participants were most likely to “define” and “describe” the knowledge but have difficulties on “comparing” and “interpreting” the knowledge. This study was conducted at the beginning of the chapter and cognitive structures of the pre-service science teachers were explored. Therefore course can be designed according to the findings of the study. © 2016, Ankara University. All rights reserved.

AB  - To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula. © 2015, The Author(s).

AB  - Background: A challenge to addressing community-defined need through community-based participatory intervention building is ensuring that all collaborators’ opinions are represented. Concept mapping integrates perspectives of individuals with differing experiences, interests, or expertise into a common visually depicted framework, and ranks composite views on importance and feasibility. Objectives: To describe the use of concept mapping to facilitate participatory intervention building for a school-based, teacher-focused, positive youth development (PYD) promotion program for Latino, Hmong, and Somali youth. Particiants were teachers, administrators, youth, parents, youth workers, and community and university researchers on the projects’ community collaborative board. We incorporated previously collected qualitative data into the process. Methods: In a mixed-methods process we 1) generated statements based on key informant interview and focus group data from youth workers, teachers, parents, and youth in multiple languages regarding ways teachers promote PYD for Somali, Latino and Hmong youth; 2) guided participants to individually sort statements into meaningful groupings and rate them by importance and feasibility; 3) mapped the statements based on their relation to each other using multivariate statistical analyses to identify concepts, and as a group identified labels for each concept; and 4) used labels and statement ratings to identify feasible and important concepts as priorities for intervention development. Results: We identified 12 concepts related to PYD promotion in schools and prioritized 8 for intervention development. Conclusions: Concept mapping facilitated participatory intervention building by formally representing all participants’ opinions, generating visual representation of group thinking, and supporting priority setting. Use of prior qualitative work increased the diversity of viewpoints represented. © 2015 The Johns Hopkins University Press.

AB  - Background: Ecological models are currently the most used approaches to classify and conceptualise determinants of sedentary behaviour, but these approaches are limited in their ability to capture the complexity of and interplay between determinants. The aim of the project described here was to develop a transdisciplinary dynamic framework, grounded in a system-based approach, for research on determinants of sedentary behaviour across the life span and intervention and policy planning and evaluation. Methods: A comprehensive concept mapping approach was used to develop the Systems Of Sedentary behaviours (SOS) framework, involving four main phases: (1) preparation, (2) generation of statements, (3) structuring (sorting and ranking), and (4) analysis and interpretation. The first two phases were undertaken between December 2013 and February 2015 by the DEDIPAC KH team (DEterminants of DIet and Physical Activity Knowledge Hub). The last two phases were completed during a two-day consensus meeting in June 2015. Results: During the first phase, 550 factors regarding sedentary behaviour were listed across three age groups (i.e., youths, adults and older adults), which were reduced to a final list of 190 life course factors in phase 2 used during the consensus meeting. In total, 69 international delegates, seven invited experts and one concept mapping consultant attended the consensus meeting. The final framework obtained during that meeting consisted of six clusters of determinants: Physical Health and Wellbeing (71 % consensus), Social and Cultural Context (59 % consensus), Built and Natural Environment (65 % consensus), Psychology and Behaviour (80 % consensus), Politics and Economics (78 % consensus), and Institutional and Home Settings (78 % consensus). Conducting studies on Institutional Settings was ranked as the first research priority. The view that this framework captures a system-based map of determinants of sedentary behaviour was expressed by 89 % of the participants. Conclusion: Through an international transdisciplinary consensus process, the SOS framework was developed for the determinants of sedentary behaviour through the life course. Investigating the influence of Institutional and Home Settings was deemed to be the most important area of research to focus on at present and potentially the most modifiable. The SOS framework can be used as an important tool to prioritise future research and to develop policies to reduce sedentary time. © 2016 The Author(s).

AB  - Background: Phantom limb pain (PLP) is a prevalent complication post-amputation. Currently, qualitative literature exploring the experience of PLP in amputees is sparse, and little is known about whether the educational needs of amputees are being met. Objectives: To explore lower limb amputees’ descriptive lived experiences of PLP, to understand how PLP affects quality of life and to determine whether amputees feel they are provided with adequate information about PLP. Methods: A qualitative descriptive approach, situated under the constructivist paradigm was taken, consisting of cross-sectional semi-structured interviews. A purposive sample of 15 lower limb amputees, 1–3 months post-surgery with past or current experience of PLP were interviewed once about their experience of PLP. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using Framework Analysis. Interviews were conducted while participants were inpatients at an amputee rehabilitation unit in London. Results: Six key themes were identified during analysis, of which three were related to PLP and are reported on in this article (real and physical phantoms, living with a phantom and being informed). PLP had numerous painful qualities. The phantom felt real, with kinetic and kinaesthetic properties. PLP had multiple meanings to amputees, was considered a reminder of circumstances and could affect quality of life. Information provided about PLP was inadequate. Conclusion: PLP can be a severe and annoying experience acting as a reminder of amputees’ circumstances. Information provided about PLP is inadequate, with some amputees still perceiving PLP as mental and imaginary. Education about PLP and awareness and accessibility to non-pharmacological interventions needs to be improved. © The British Pain Society 2015.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to illustrate the connections between the uses of concept mapping and structural equation modeling (SEM). Concept maps can also be used to help authors organize and structure reviewed literature in a manner that may help them find their voice when adding to the existing conversation on a particular topic. A discussion of the process recently utilized for a doctoral dissertation is presented to provide an example of this organizational process by presenting a summary of the literature review with a concept map of the review and the supporting documents attached to the appropriate concepts as re-sources. Dissertation examples are then used to further demonstrate how the connections between concept mapping the review of literature and using a concept map to visualize the analyses can help students demystify research methodology, especially, the use of SEM. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Current research in physics shows that pre-service teachers have poor content knowledge in vector-kinematics. This study describes the types of categories of conceptions pre-service teachers display in vector-kinematics. Descriptive and interpretive qualitative research was conducted in which the data were concept maps from 28 third-year pre-service teacher volunteers in a physics module at a university. Participants were supported in the use of CmapTools to draw their concept maps of vector-kinematics. This study was guided by Ausubel’s theory of meaningful learning which relates individuals’ new knowledge to relevant concepts they already possess. Framework thematic analysis revealed seven knowledge categories with differing extensiveness: two of conceptual knowledge (hierarchical and relational), three of alternative conceptions (naïve, lateral, ontological) and two of mixed conceptions and loose ideas. The findings showed a lack of higher level conceptual understanding of vector-kinematics. The study has implications for the teaching and learning of vector-kinematics. © 2016, Scientific Methodical Center. All rights reserved.

AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers’ classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimentala), the contemporary condition (Experimentalb), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students’ discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimentala and Experimentalb conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students’ scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently. © 2015 University of Cambridge, Faculty of Education.

AB  - Despite recent advances in undergraduate medical education, integration of vertical curricula and simultaneous delivery of competencies remain challenging. To address this educational challenge, we delivered a series of case-based exercises to a combined class of M1 and M2 students to achieve vertical (year-to-year) and horizontal (clinical and basic science) integration. These exercises consisted of a case, concept mapping activity to link basic science content to an underlying symptom, and follow-up discussion. Following the activities, students were asked to complete a survey evaluating the effectiveness of their experience including level of learning, effectiveness of peer teaching, and incorporation of core competencies. Overall, the students described the activity positively (informative and engaging). M1 students reported regularly helping M2 students review the M1 material. Unsurprisingly, the M2 students assisted the M1 students with the M2 material to a greater extent and significantly improved the M1 students’ confidence with that material. The M2 students generally felt successful in peer teaching but reported that it regularly revealed intrinsic knowledge gaps. As important, this activity reportedly addressed competencies in addition to Medical Knowledge, specifically Communication Skills, Practice-Based Learning, and Professionalism. In summary, this learning activity provided opportunities for students to (1) refine clinical reasoning and peer-peer teaching skills, (2) reinforce the basic science content within a clinical context, and (3) integrate several additional key core competencies into the heavily Medical-Knowledge-focused pre-clerkship curriculum. This novel activity facilitated vertical and horizontal integration of several key core competencies in a manner that could be incorporated and assessed in nearly any curricular structure. © 2015, International Association of Medical Science Educators.

AB  - Quantitative assessment of learning is an important indicator of teaching practices apart from the depth and grasp of content being assessed. Fundamental objective of assessment approaches should help promote learner engagement and is appropriate to the diversity of learners that may be present in any class. Learning from online or virtual classrooms can be more challenging due to lack of direct personal engagement between the teacher and the student. There are various modes of assessment commonly adopted today and students may exhibit different levels of performance based on the assessment method. This paper focuses on cross-comparison of these techniques to learning of laboratory concepts in a virtual environment. Apart from comparison of the commonly used assessment methods such as multiple choice questions, descriptive questions, true/false statements etc., the work explores the best methodology to correlate assessment from a reliability and validity perspective to the learning objectives and measure the progress of individual students. Correlating the innate learning styles of students to assessment approaches is another outcome of this work. In addition, the use of concept maps to assess the relationship between various science based principles is characterized for two different experimental labs with N=147 students. The advantages to using assessment techniques from a 'time-toassess' is also elaborated in this work. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - A pervasive notion in the literature is that complex concept maps reflect greater knowledge and/or more expert-like thinking than less complex concept maps. We show that concept maps used to structure scientific writing and clarify scientific reasoning do not adhere to this notion. In an undergraduate course for thesis writers, students use concept maps instead of traditional outlines to define the boundaries and scope of their research and to construct an argument for the significance of their research. Students generate maps at the beginning of the semester, revise after peer review, and revise once more at the end of the semester. Although some students revised their maps to make them more complex, a significant proportion of students simplified their maps. We found no correlation between increased complexity and improved scientific reasoning and writing skills, suggesting that sometimes students simplify their understanding as they develop more expert-like thinking. These results suggest that concept maps, when used as an intervention, can meet the varying needs of a diverse population of student writers. © 2015 J. E. Dowd et al. CBE—Life Sciences Education.

AB  - Games can be structured by means of game elements. Any element that can be found in the game is a game element. Not all of these elements are necessary in order to generate engaging game experience, but they all serve a purpose. Therefore it is important to know what elements the games can have. Researchers and designers have different opinions about what elements games should have. There is a need for a proper list of game elements used in different games and mentioned in different research reports. To find out what are the central game elements, a quasi literature review was conducted. All together 103 different game elements were found. In order to orientate in so big number of game elements, a more refined structure was needed. For this purpose a network analysis of game elements was conducted and a concept map was created. The network shows the central elements and connections between game elements. According to the results of the analysis - the central game element is challenges. Third outcome of this study was a concept map of frequently used and central game elements in order to give a simplistic and holistic view. This study can be useful for game designers in selecting suitable game design elements and justifying their selection. It is also helpful for instructional designers who are interested in gamification (selecting and using game elements in education). © The Authors, 2016. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Gesture-based learning have particularities, because learners interact in the learning process through the actual way, just like they interact in the nondigital world. It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners' learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90 participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system, conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. Learners' cognitive load was also measured and showed that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials. © 2016 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.

AB  - It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction. A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received "Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum" instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed. The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests. The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking and knowledge retention. © 2016 by the author/s; licensee iSER, Ankara, TURKEY.

AB  - This study sought to determine the levels of conceptual understanding of undergraduate students regarding organic compounds within different functional groups. A total of 60 students who were enrolled in the Department of Secondary Science and Mathematics Education of a Faculty of Education at a state university in Turkey and who had followed an Organic Chemistry Laboratory Course participated in the study. The data were collected using two tools: functional group worksheets and concept maps. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations were used in analyzing the data. The findings showed that the students generally had low levels of understanding of concepts relating to functional groups, and they exhibited a considerable number of misconceptions. Considering the findings more fully, it was determined that students have remarkable misconceptions and low levels of understanding about certain topics regarding functional groups, including the physical properties of functional groups, intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, reduction and oxidation, stereoisomerism and structural isomerism, and aromaticity and aliphaticity, as well as other organic chemistry concepts (e.g. decarboxylation, oxyacide, and phenol). The results suggest that since students are unable to adequately comprehend the subjects of general chemistry, such as intramolecular and intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, oxidation and reduction and determination of molecular structures, they fail to accurately transfer their knowledge to learning about organic chemistry. In order to promote students' understanding of functional groups and prevent related misconceptions, it is recommended that basic chemistry topics should be reinforced, and the relationship between students' current knowledge and the new information to be learned in organic chemistry should be emphasized with the help of activities in which various forms of thinking are used. ©2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Inspired by the semantic network studies we propose additional conventions for choosing linking words and arrive at a Reference Set of semantically well-defined linking words drawn from the Knowledge Representation area of research in the domain of biology. Each linking word in the set is assigned a dimension: part-whole, class-inclusion, spatial-inclusion, function and attribution. We study expert representations by content analysis of biology texts at three levels of increasing subject complexity. We compare the linking words used in these representations with the Reference Set and find an increasing degree of proximity to the latter. This indicates that experts tend to use more well-defined linking words. Regarding this proximity as a characteristic of expertise, we can encourage novices to re-represent their concept maps using the linking words from the Reference Set. We discuss the implications of the approach for science education. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - Objective: To assess the effectiveness of concept mapping (CM) on the academic performance of medical students’ in problem-solving as well as in declarative knowledge questions and their perception regarding CM. Methods: The present analytical and questionnaire-based study was carried out at Bahria University Medical and Dental College (BUMDC), Karachi, Pakistan. In this analytical study, students were assessed with problem-solving questions (A-type MCQs), and declarative knowledge questions (short essay questions), and 50% of the questions were from the topics learned by CM. Students also filled a 10-item, 3-point Likert scale questionnaire about their perception regarding the effectiveness of the CM approach, and two open-ended questions were also asked. Results: There was a significant difference in the marks obtained in those problem-solving questions, which were learned by CM as compared to those topics which were taught by the traditional lectures (p<0.001), while no significant difference was observed in marks in declarative knowledge questions (p=0.704). Analysis of students’ perception regarding CM showed that majority of the students perceive that CM is a helpful technique and it is enjoyed by the students. In open-ended questions, the majority of the students commented positively about the effectiveness of CM. Conclusion: Our results indicate that CM improves academic performance in problem solving but not in declarative knowledge questions. Students’ perception about the effectiveness of CM was overwhelmingly positive. © 2016, Professional Medical Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - Increasingly, organizations in general, and social service organizations, specifically, are recognizing the importance of planning and evaluating organizational wellness initiatives. Yet, few participatory models for carrying out these aims exist. For this study, researchers utilized concept mapping (CM) to explicate a conceptual framework for planning, and subsequently evaluating, a wellness initiative at a multi-state social service organization. CM is a participatory approach that analyzes qualitative data via multi-dimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses. Outputs include a number of visual depictions that allow researchers to explore complex relationships among sets of the data. Results from this study indicated that participants (N = 64), all of whom were employees of the agency, conceptualized organizational wellness via an eight-cluster solution, or Concept Map. Priority areas of this framework, specifically importance and feasibility, were also explored. After a brief review of pertinent literature, this article explicates the CM methodology utilized in this study, describes results, discusses lessons learned, and identifies apt areas for future research. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Location, as the fundamental concept in geography, is important for all sciences that study objects and behaviours in geo-space. Although other disciplines are capable of formulating definitions of location and geo-space, they nevertheless look up to geography to devise and articulate a comprehensive and practical concept of ‘everything geographic’. Essentially quantitative in its concern, geography has yet to quantify the concept of geo-space in order to both fulfil the ancient Greeks' vision of geography and advance it for use in other disciplines. We revisit the epistemological and broader philosophical principles of geo-space and apply these principles to identifying and quantifying the key aspects of geo-space: topos, choros and geos. Rather than following the narrow numerical tradition of quantitative geography and GIS, we adopt broader philosophical perspective of Kant on Quantity (Unity, Multiplicity, Totality) and argue that the ‘natural’ extension of the classical approach to geo-space necessitates its further philosophical quantification. We show that the ancient Greeks' concept maps into locations (topos), spatial relations (choros) and topology (geos). Extending the concept further necessitates the use of the language of set theory for defining basic concepts. We show that the result is both tractable and quantifiable, connects classical with modern and completes the definition of geo-space on all three levels of Quantity (unity, multiplicity, totality). We demonstrate the tractability of thus defined concept by reinterpreting Tobler's First Law of geography in theoretically sound terms. We show that a refined, modern concept of geo-space is both philosophically fulfilling and practically useful – some properties of geo-space are too important to be ignored or distorted.

AB  - Background: Pre-registration programs have been found to insufficiently prepare nurses for working in the neurosciences specialism. Effective approaches to neurology education are important, not only to enhance motivation to learn, but also for learners to develop basic competence in handling patients with neurological problems. Objectives: To demonstrate that outcome-based course design using concept mapping would bring about significant differences in the nursing students' competency, cognitive load, and learning satisfaction with the neurological care course. Methods: A two-group pretest and post-test experimental study was administered. Two of the four clusters of participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group for experiencing an outcome-based course design using concept mapping, and the rest were designated the control group to be given objective-based lectures only. The Competency Inventory of Nursing Students, Cognitive Load Scale of Neurological Nursing, and Learning Satisfaction Scale of Neurological Nursing were used in this study for the students to rate their own performance. In addition, The Concept Map Scoring Scale was used in the experimental group for examining students' concept mapping ability. Results: Significant increases of mean nursing competency scores in both groups from pre-test to post-test were found. There was no statistically significant difference in mean nursing competency score between the experimental group and the control groups at post-test. The mean cognitive load score of the experimental group was lower than the control group at post-test. The mean learning satisfaction scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. Conclusions: This article provides that outcome-based concept mapping as educational method could encourage a group of nursing students to take a bio-psycho-social approach to medicine, which might ultimately result in better nursing care quality. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The aim was to identify and synthesize research evidence about how adults and older adults process somatosensory information in daily activities, and the interventions available to regain somatosensory function following stroke. We developed two interacting concept maps to address the research questions. The scoping review was conducted from 2005 to 2015 across Web of Science, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and PsychInfo databases. Search terms included somatosensory, perception, performance, participation, older adult, stroke, intervention, discrimination, learning, and neuroplasticity. Contributions from 103 articles for Concept 1 and 14 articles for Concept 2 are reported. Measures of somatosensory processing, performance, and participation used are identified. Interventions available to treat somatosensory loss are summarized in relation to approach, outcome measures, and theory/mechanisms underlying. A gap exists in the current understanding of how somatosensory function affects the daily lives of adults. A multidisciplinary approach that includes performance and participation outcomes is recommended to advance the field. © The Author(s) 2016.

AB  - This pilot study investigates the impact of a 2-week professional development Summer Institute on PK-3 teachers’ knowledge and practices. This Summer Institute is a component of [program], a large-scale early-childhood science project that aims to transform PK-3 science teaching. The mixed-methods study examined concept maps, lesson plans, and classroom observations to measure possible changes in PK-3 teachers’ science content knowledge and classroom practice from 11 teachers who attended the 2014 Summer Institute. Analysis of the concept maps demonstrated statistically significant growth in teachers’ science content knowledge. Analysis of teachers’ lesson plans demonstrated that the teachers could design high quality science inquiry lessons aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards following the professional development. Finally, examination of teachers’ pre- and post-Summer Institute videotaped inquiry lessons showed evidence that teachers were incorporating new inquiry practices into their teaching, especially regarding classroom discourse. Our results suggest that an immersive inquiry experience is effective at beginning a shift towards reform-aligned science and engineering instruction but that early elementary educators require additional support for full mastery. © 2016, The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.

AB  - Heterogeneous online learning environments such as Go-Lab foster student-centered and exploratory STEM education through the promotion of Inquiry Learning. Although the learner is encouraged to create learning objects such as concept maps or hypotheses, the interpretation and reflection on them is complicated by differences in their form of representation. This work presents the ConceptCloud app which aggregates learner-generated textual objects by constructing a tag cloud visualization and simplifying reflective processes. In order to validate this approach, a user study examines the app in a classroom scenario. The results reveal a low involvement of the ConceptCloud in the learning process, which might indicate the necessity of more guidance to increase learners engagement and awareness of the app. The teachers perspective is received positively, since they felt supported in supervising students activities and facilitating a teacher-led inquiry approach trough usage of the CC. © 2016 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

AB  - Concept map activities often lack a subsequent revision step that facilitates knowledge integration. This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (n = 81) using an online inquiry-based learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peer-review. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert-map condition focused mostly on concept-focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer-review condition used more link-focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students' organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education.

AB  - Outcomes assessment of undergraduate neuroscience curricula should assess the ability to think integratively about basic neuroscience concepts based on two of the core competencies established by the Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience. The current study investigated whether the structural assessment of knowledge (SAK) approach, which evaluates the organization of an individual's knowledge structures, is effective for demonstrating learning of basic neuroscience concepts. Students in an introductory psychology course (n = 29), an introductory neuroscience course (n = 19), or an advanced behavioral neuroscience course (n = 15) completed SAK before and after learning gross brain anatomy and neuronal physiology. All students showed improvements in their SAK after short-term dissemination for gross brain anatomy, but not for neuronal physiology, concepts. Therefore, research is needed to determine whether the effectiveness of SAK in outcomes assessment depends on the content or teaching style. Additional research using SAK should also explore effectiveness for learning over longer time frames and correlations with student performance in the course. However, the results suggest SAK is a promising technique for outcomes assessment of undergraduate neuroscience curricula. © 2016 Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience.

AB  - Nurses confront complex problems and decisions that require critical thinking in order to identify patient needs and implement best practices. An active strategy for teaching students the skills to think critically is the concept map. This study explores the development of critical thinking among nursing students in a required pathophysiology and pharmacology course during the first year of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in response to concept mapping as an interventional strategy, using the Health Education Systems, Incorporated critical thinking test. A two-group experimental study with a pretest and posttest design was used. Participants were randomly divided into a control group (n = 42) taught by traditional didactic lecturing alone, and an intervention group (n = 41), taught by traditional didactic lecturing with concept mapping. Students in the concept mapping group performed much better on the Health Education Systems, Incorporated than students in the control group. It is recommended that deans, program directors, and nursing faculties evaluate their curricula to integrate concept map teaching strategies in courses in order to develop critical thinking abilities in their students.  © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.

AB  - Hypersonics is the flight regime characterized by conditions in which high temperature and extreme heat flux dominate the flow physics. This regime spans high speed aircraft around Mach 5 through atmospheric entry of spacecraft at Mach 25 to 30. Stagnation temperatures frequently climb into the many thousands of degrees, well beyond the melt temperature of any known materials. Conventional thermal protection systems for the most extreme conditions employ ablative shielding, making use of latent heat for phase transition and gaseous advection to maintain vehicle airframe temperatures to within a manageable range for the short duration of entry. More recently, space planes and high-lift entry vehicles have enabled significantly lower heating by bleeding off airspeed at higher altitudes before descending into the dense lower atmosphere. These lower heat fluxes are managed with temperature resistant, extremely-low-thermal-conductivity heat shields during the transient entry process. The concepts explored in the present work include variations on past efforts and incorporation of existing component technologies into new applications, particularly in the context of liquidvapor evaporation-condensation cycles for thermal energy transport. This paper is intended as concept map summary, providing flight conditions and feasibility for two-phase thermal protection systems, including conventional ablation, transpiration, internal spray cooling, thermosyphons and heat pipes, loop heat pipes, and solid-liquid phase change media. With heat transport demonstrated into the kilowatts per square centimeter, two-phase systems provide a promising class of reusable and continuous technologies for managing the extreme heat fluxes encountered by hypersonic vehicles. © 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

AB  - If a person has 'a problem' to solve and knows the solution and just has to apply it (retrieve it from memory and re-act), it is not a problem - it is a task; if a person does not know the solution and has to create it - this is a problem. Using this language, there are only two situations: (a) one has to perform a task; or (b) one has to solve a problem by creating a new (for the person) procedure, i.e. one has to create a brand new (for the one) solution; of course, one must utilize some of the knowledge previously stored in the memory (we could call this action 'creative utilization of previous knowledge'). If a student learned how to perform a task, he or she can repeat it in the future as many times as this student has to repeat the same task. The key word is 'the same'. Our brain is a powerful pattern recognition machine. As soon as it recognizes the task, it retrieves from memory the sequence of the actions, which has to be performed to succeed. If a brain does not recognize the task, we have two options: (a) the task is the same but due to some features it is camouflaged as a different one; (b) the task is different from the ones in the past and is really new for the brain, and the brain does not have the solution (at least in full) in its storage. Of course, we assume that a particular brain is capable of storing and retrieving the information and governing the actions required for fulfilling the task (otherwise we have to discuss a case of learning disabilities). Based on this approach, every teacher has to teach students to two different practices: (a) how to perform specific tasks (the set of those tasks should be specified by a curriculum); (b) how to create a solution to a problem which has not been solved in the past (by that person); the latter practice, in turn, requires a practice in making a conclusion regarding the familiarity of the given assignment - is it the same as one from the past (is it a task?) or different (is it a problem?)? Development of such a skill also requires specific practice. Teaching how to find a solution means (in part) teaching how to recognize the old task in the new one and to apply the appropriate method (which worked in the past). Teaching how to create/invent a solution which has not been presented/trained before (at least in full) means teaching thinking creatively (a.c.a. critically). Although due to the definition of 'creativity'the act of creating something new should be seen as the result of an insight, a teacher can help a student to get to that insight as close as possible using specific teaching tools (learning AIDS). Many teaching instruments of the kind have been discussed and offered by various research. For example, E F Redish (2004) offers a general framework for Physics Education Research based on modeling student thinking. 'Teaching Introductory Physics' by Arnold B Arons (1997) is an invaluable source of many teaching tools and techniques. Many specific teaching strategies, including examples of mapping and guided thinking one will find in the works of K Heller and P Heller (1995). A Elby (2001) provides a broad summary on helping students learn how to learn (including asking prompting questions). D Rosengrant et al (2009) offer a study of the use of diagrams, including free-body diagrams, as a helping tool for solving problems in mechanics. D Van Domelen provides a review of the use of strategy maps and thinking algorithms. An excellent recourse letter is provided by L C McDermont and E F Redish (1999). The use of concept maps in education has been discussed in details by J D Novak (1984). In these works a reader will find a description of several tools which the author finds also helpful for students learning how to solve physics problems. These tools help students to get a better understanding of how a mind of an expert problem solver works when solving a problem. © 2015 IOP Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Background: The explication of relations between clinical and basic sciences can help vertical integration in medical curricula. Concept mapping might be a useful technique for this explication. Little is known about teachers' ability regarding the articulation of integration. We examined therefore which factors affect the learning of groups of clinicians and basic scientists on different expertise levels who learn to articulate the integration of clinical and basic sciences in concept maps. Methods: After a pilot for fine-tuning group size and instructions, seven groups of expert clinicians and basic scientists and seven groups of residents with a similar disciplinary composition constructed concept maps about a clinical problem that fit their specializations. Draft and final concepts maps were compared on elaborateness and articulated integration by means of t-tests. Participants completed a questionnaire on motivation and their evaluation of the instructions. ANOVA's were run to compare experts' and residents' views. Data from video tapes and notes were qualitatively analyzed. Finally, the three data sources were interpreted in coherence by using Pearson's correlations and qualitative interpretation. Results: Residents outshone experts as regards learning to articulate integration as comparison of the draft and final versions showed. Experts were more motivated and positive about the concept mapping procedure and instructions, but this did not correlate with the extent of integration fond in the concept maps. The groups differed as to communication: residents interacted from the start (asking each other for clarification), whereas overall experts only started interaction when they had to make joint decisions. Conclusions: Our results suggest that articulation of integration can be learned, but this learning is not related to participants' motivation or their views on the instructions. Decision making and interaction, however, do relate to the articulation of integration and this suggests that teacher learning programs for designing integrated educational programmes should incorporate co-construction tasks. Expertise level turned out to be decisive for both the level of articulation of integration, the ability to improve the articulated integration and the cooperation pattern. © 2015 Vink et al.; licensee BioMed Central.

AB  - Among policy makers, there is an ongoing discussion about the need to improve undergraduate education in science and engineering. With many undergraduate students being taught by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs), it is important to explore the development of STEM knowledge for teaching by GTAs. This study follows ten GTAs as they participated in a GTA teaching program that included attending a “Scientific Teaching” course. Data collection consisted of open-ended questionnaires and concept maps. Analysis revealed that a majority of the GTAs employed more didactic, teacher-centered practices while having varied levels of development in the areas of student understanding and instructional strategies. Those GTAs with regularly scheduled opportunities to work directly with students increased their knowledge for teaching. Additionally, GTAs with lower levels of prior teaching experience and an expressed desire to improve their teaching had the highest levels of knowledge development. From this study, we suggest that GTA programs support GTAs by initiating the preparation for teaching early in the TA experience. Finally, we recommend that science departments place more emphasis on teaching by providing GTAs with additional science education coursework as well as structured opportunities to work directly with students and to practice making use of reformed teaching strategies. © 2016, Arizona State University.

AB  - Concept map analysis usually focuses only on the final product. This case study used a talk aloud protocol to study the concept map construction processes of novices and experts. Three biology experts and three novices (9th/10th grade high school students) constructed a concept map from a given list of concepts. Findings suggest that final concept maps of high performing students cannot be distinguished from expert-generated maps. However, analysis of oral elaborations during the construction process revealed that experts often used the same link labels as novices but associated more complex knowledge with the label. Some final propositions would be considered incorrect without an oral explanation. Findings suggest extending concept map evaluation by complementing the final product with an analysis of intermediate stages and accompanying elaborations. Additionally, this study highlights that each expert created a different map and that there is no single best expert map. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - As a graphical tool for knowledge organization, representation, and elicitation, concept mapping has received growing attention and application in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines as an effective instructional strategy to improve student conceptual understanding. This paper reports how the concept mapping approach was employed in a foundational undergraduate engineering dynamics course. In this course, students (rather than the instructor) developed their concept maps to illustrate the evolution of key concepts in engineering dynamics. Data were collected from students who took an engineering dynamics course in recent two semesters: Semester I when concept mapping was not employed and Semester II when concept mapping was employed. The results show that as compared to Semester I, students developed better conceptual understanding in Semester II. Four representative examples of concept maps generated by students in Semester II are presented in this paper. A representative set of student comments are also presented, which demonstrate how the concept mapping approach helped students develop better conceptual understanding. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2016.

AB  - This classroom action research was conducted to analyze the development of the students’ inquiry abilities in science learning by a learning model of mindmap educative by using game observation normatively (Megono). The study was conducted in three cycles. In each cycle, the students were divided into five groups, each groups consisted of seven students. Each group was mandated to observe and to analyze the images/photos. After the image observations, they were asked to discuss, write and compile the information into a concept map. One of the students was act as a representative of the group in a game of observation. Data were obtained through the pre-test, post-test, and observation by the observers as well as from the photo and video recording. The results showed that the students’ inquiry ability increased by 63.27% at the end of the cycle. At the initial conditions, the ability of the student was low (0.49). After the first cycle, it increased to 0.63 (medium), and then increased to 0.68 (moderate) on the second cycle, and finally it increased to 0.80 (high) in the third cycle. The average increase in every aspect was 68.59%. The highest inquiry capability was achieved in aspects of reasoning amounted to 89.29 (very high). It was suggested to use the observation games fairly and needed more time adjustment to obtain higher learning outcomes. © 2016 Science Education Study Program FMIPA UNNES Semarang.

AB  - Research has suggested that teaching and learning in molecular and cellular biology (MCB) is difficult. We used a new lens to understand undergraduate reasoning about molecular mechanisms: the knowledge-integration approach to conceptual change. Knowledge integration is the dynamic process by which learners acquire new ideas, develop connections between ideas, and reorganize and restructure prior knowledge. Semistructured, clinical think-aloud interviews were conducted with introductory and upper-division MCB students. Interviews included a written conceptual assessment, a concept-mapping activity, and an opportunity to explain the biomechanisms of DNA replication, transcription, and translation. Student reasoning patterns were explored through mixed-method analyses. Results suggested that students must sort mechanistic entities into appropriate mental categories that reflect the nature of MCB mechanisms and that conflation between these categories is common. We also showed how connections between molecular mechanisms and their biological roles are part of building an integrated knowledge network as students develop expertise. We observed differences in the nature of connections between ideas related to different forms of reasoning. Finally, we provide a tentative model for MCB knowledge integration and suggest its implications for undergraduate learning. © 2016 K. Southard et al.

AB  - The value of course evaluations has been debated since they frequently fail to capture the complexity of education and learning. Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a participant-centred mixed-method was explored as a tool for evaluation and development in nursing education and to better understand students' learning experiences, using data from a GCM-based evaluation of a research training assignment integrating clinical practice and research data collection within a Swedish university nursing program. Student nurses (n = 47) participated in a one-day GCM exercise. Focus group brainstorming regarding experiences from the assignment that the students considered important and instructive yielded 98 statements that were individually sorted based on their student-perceived relationships, and rated regarding their importance/instructiveness and need for development. Quantitative analysis of sort data produced a 2-dimensional map representing their conceptual relationships, and eight conceptual areas. Average cluster ratings were plotted relative to each other and provided a decision aid for development and planning by identifying areas (i.e., “Research methodology”, “Patients' perspectives”, and “Interviewer role”) considered highly important/instructive and in high need for development. These experiences illustrate the use and potential of GCM as an interactive participant-centred approach to evaluation, planning and development in nursing and other higher health science educations. © 2016

AB  - This study examined the reflection interview as a tool for assessing and facilitating the use of ‘systems language’ amongst 11th grade students who have recently completed their first year of high school biology. Eighty-three students composed two concept maps in the 10th grade—one at the beginning of the school year and one at its end. The first part of the interview is dedicated to guiding the students through comparing their two concept maps and by means of both explicit and non-explicit teaching. Our study showed that the explicit guidance in comparing the two concept maps was more effective than the non-explicit, eliciting a variety of different, more specific, types of interactions and patterns (e.g. ‘hierarchy’, ‘dynamism’, ‘homeostasis’) in the students’ descriptions of the human body system. The reflection interview as a knowledge integration activity was found to be an effective tool for assessing the subjects’ conceptual models of ‘system complexity’, and for identifying those aspects of a system that are most commonly misunderstood. © 2016 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The economical changes of the last decade, as well as the new customer patterns and global competitiveness demand new methods and tools that will increase the creativity and innovation of the knowledge workers. While the focus in the past was on how to improve the organizations, the current dynamics render the old methods unusable. What is needed are the methods to support the inter-personal communication and productivity in order to maintain a higher level of knowledge entropy that can eventually lead to increase in new ideas. This paper presents a vision of a virtual space of networked individuals, based on Virtual & Augmented Reality, forming ad-hoc groups on the basis of common interests. The basic idea is how to connect people and concepts together, what methods to use, and how to make the collaboration and the exchange of information more fluent and easier to handle. Important issues like how to link collaborative resources together or how to discover new resources within the population of a virtual community and browsing through the people-concepts maps, within a VAR environment, are discussed. A possible platform to stimulate creativity and innovation is envisaged. The paper looks into later collaborative environments and their benefits into providing much faster and broader access to existing knowledge and people know-how, thus providing more tools and new technologies to professionals engaged into knowledge intensive work. New concepts like Augmented Reality are proposed as alternative environment for deploying applications supporting the individual and group collaboration work. The new framework is described and a plan for setting a small empirical study is analysed covering the issues of interaction and collaboration in education and training. This paper is trying to find the methods that can be used first for the evaluation and later for deployment of new tools and techniques that will improve the creativity and innovation within online collaboration sessions. The benefits of the research include providing more supportive, appealing and communicative applications by applying various design theories and practices into virtual enterprise system development. The paper concludes by introducing a new scientific domain branded 'Knowledge Connection' which stands at the crossroads of existing scientific domains such as Knowledge Creation, Representation and Visualisation, Collaborative or Shared Workspace., and Virtual & Augmented Reality. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - How conceptual knowledge is represented in the human brain remains to be determined. To address the differential role of low-level sensory-based and high-level abstract features in semantic processing, we combined behavioral studies of linguistic production and brain activity measures by functional magnetic resonance imaging in sighted and congenitally blind individuals while they performed a property-generation task with concrete nouns from eight categories, presented through visual and/or auditory modalities.Patterns of neural activity within a large semantic cortical network that comprised parahippocampal, lateral occipital, temporo-parieto-occipital and inferior parietal cortices correlated with linguistic production and were independent both from the modality of stimulus presentation (either visual or auditory) and the (lack of) visual experience. In contrast, selected modality-dependent differences were observed only when the analysis was limited to the individual regions within the semantic cortical network.We conclude that conceptual knowledge in the human brain relies on a distributed, modality-independent cortical representation that integrates the partial category and modality specific information retained at a regional level. © 2016 The Authors.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to report on the concept map evaluation of an innovative STEM project for 4-and 5-year-old children. An American university research team developed and implemented a 3-month pilot program using engineering and robotics as the platform for teaching programming and problem solving. The engineering-focused lessons used a developmentally, age appropriate robot (KIBO) to teach simple programming skills while practicing a problem solving process designed to transfer to other settings. Researchers delivered the twice weekly lessons, integrated into the adopted prekindergarten curriculum, and implemented as part of the established center rotations. Researchers used child interviews and concept mapping as a measure of children’s knowledge of robotics and problem solving to estimate growth in their knowledge over time. Results indicated that the children exhibited increased knowledge of robotics, 93%, and problem solving, 42%, mostly resulting from the increased use of propositions and cross-links. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of using Google Docs in collaborative concept mapping (CCM) by comparing it with a paper-and-pencil approach. A quasi-experimental study was conducted in a physics course. The control group drew concept maps using the paper-and-pencil method and face-to-face discussion, whereas the experimental group employed Google Docs to create concept maps and used Google Chat for discussion. Learning achievements, physics concept representation, attitudes toward science, and attitudes toward CCM were examined to identify the differences between the two groups and the effectiveness of Google Docs. The results suggested that the use of Google Docs did not significantly affect physics achievement. However, Google Docs fostered physics concept representation and enhanced attitudes toward science. Moreover, the Google Docs group tended to learn more collaboratively. The students in this group also agreed with the superiority of observation and modification functions provided by the real-time co-editing mechanism and revision history. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - Experimental learning combined with theoretical learning enhances the conceptual understanding of a subject. Therefore, the Online Labs (OLabs) that hosts science experiments was developed. OLabs uses interactive simulations with theory, procedure, animations, videos, assessments and reference material. Our study blended OLabs with concept maps to examine if it enhances students' learning in Biology. Concept mapping is a framework that provides a deeper knowledge of a subject by understanding the relationships among concepts. The study was quasi-experimental; pre-test, post-test and a satisfaction survey was used as measurement instruments. The study sample was 54 students from a school in Haripad, Kerala, India. The students were randomly grouped into a control and an experimental group. The experimental group that used concept maps as a learning aid scored slightly higher, suggesting blending concept maps can lead to a deeper understanding of the subject. Gender difference did not significantly affect the scores. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - We have already proposed a framework of kit-build concept map where a learner is provided a set of parts of a concept map and is requested to build a concept map by composing the parts. In this framework, a build map by a learner is able to be diagnosed automatically. The kit-building task of a concept map is a promising exercise for strengthening and assessing learner's comprehension for a topic that a learner already has learnt. We have implemented an interactive learning environment based on the framework and practically used the environment in several schools. In this paper, in order to investigate the value of the kit-building task of a concept map, we compare it with multiple-choice task of fill-in-The-blank questions. The multiple choice task of fill-in-The-blank questions is also used to strengthen and assess learner's comprehension, and the answer can be automatically evaluated. Then, the both task can be generated from the same series of propositions, that is, from the same contents. We have compared the two tasks through 3 lessons of science learning of 5th grade students in two classes. One class used KB map (KB class) and another class used Fill-In-The-Blank questions (FIB class). Individual student in both classes used a tablet PC. The tablet PC was connected to a server though wireless LAN and a teacher could receive the results of evaluations of the maps or answers' of the questions immediately. Based on the evaluation results, the teacher conducted additional teaching. As the results, the KB task evaluated learner's comprehension more adequately than the question task, and the students in the KB class had higher performance than the students in the question class.

While faculty have discussed the relative merits of simulation versus real experimentation in recent years, we find that combining these approaches has multiple advantages: (1) A TIMSTM based approach (where we have chosen to use 'real-world' demodulated audio from local radio stations as the local message signal) makes students feel that they are engaged in 'real-world modulation/demodulation;' (2) The TIMSTM based approach inherently reinforces a 'concept map' (block diagram) view of communications modulation and demodulation; (3) The MATLAB® simulation approach forces students to think about how to perform a proper simulation (e.g. set appropriate sampling rate, set appropriate specifications for digital filter design for envelope detector or discriminator, etc.) for both analog and digital simulation; and (4) The MATLAB® simulation approach sets a starting point for our students as they pursue software defined radio (SDR) communications applications in some of their senior design projects. We find synergy in combining the two pedagogical approaches in most of the labs in our communications systems course, and this typically results in enhanced student comprehension. While more formal assessment will be conducted over the next two years, at this point we know from course feedback that students very much appreciate both learning tools. Students commonly remark that the TIMSTM really highlights the 'big picture,' and helps them understand what to expect before they start the MATLAB® simulations, while coding up the MATLAB® simulations gets them 'into the weeds,' and gives them the tools to test out ideas that support their senior projects. © 2015 IEEE.

AB  - This two-group quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of the Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material (ONACOM) integrated with inquiry teaching and expository teaching methods. Grade 7 students’ posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest–posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students’ achievement and improve their attitude. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - Purpose Health research that includes youth and family stakeholders increases the contextual relevance of findings, which can benefit both the researchers and stakeholders involved. The goal of this study was to identify youth and family adolescent health priorities and to explore strategies to address these concerns. Methods Stakeholders identified important adolescent health concerns, perceptions of which were then explored using concept mapping. Concept mapping is a mixed-method participatory research approach that invites input from various stakeholders. In response to prompts, stakeholders suggested ways to address the identified health conditions. Adolescent participants then sorted the statements into groups based on content similarity and rated the statements for importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were then applied to create the concept maps. Results Stakeholders identified sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and obesity as the health conditions they considered most important. The concept map for STIs identified 7 clusters: General sex education, support and empowerment, testing and treatment, community involvement and awareness, prevention and protection, parental involvement in sex education, and media. The obesity concept map portrayed 8 clusters: Healthy food choices, obesity education, support systems, clinical and community involvement, community support for exercise, physical activity, nutrition support, and nutrition education. Ratings were generally higher for importance than for feasibility. Conclusions The concept maps demonstrate stakeholder-driven ideas about approaches to target STIs and obesity in this context. Strategies at multiple social ecological levels were emphasized. The concept maps can be used to generate discussion regarding these topics and to identify interventions. © 2016 Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine. All rights reserved.

AB  - Knowledge assessment can be defined as the process to describe, collect and provide useful information to make decision concerning leaner progress and various approaches of learning to be adopted. The assessment of questions with open and short answers, where the learner has to develop a response going of some words to 5 lines, constitutes a type of complex assessment technique. In this paper, we present an approach which can assist tutors in assessment of questions with open and short response by using concept maps for the answers and semantic similarity measures between the texts. This short answer assessment is based on the reference response prepared by the tutor. Following a knowledge base generation starting from the important concepts of the learner and tutor answers, we propose to compare them with a similarity measure to calculate and deliver a final score to the answer. © 2015 ACM.

AB  - The use of a companion app to augment viewing of information-rich television programmes is investigated. The app displays a synchronised graphical abstraction of a programme’s content in the form of a concept map. Two experiments were conducted involving participants watching an astronomy documentary with the app. The first compared watching the programme with and without the app, and the second compared non-interactive and interactive versions of the app. Understanding of the programme, cross-device gaze behaviour, and user experience of the app were assessed. Our results show that the companion app improved participants’ understanding and recall of the programme. Participants were found to manage their visual attention systematically when using the companion app, and correlations were found in the way they shifted their gaze from TV screen to tablet and back in response to changes in the programme content. Increasing interaction with the app disrupted understanding of the television programme and visual attention. Participants were positive about the value of companion apps for understanding and recall of programmes, but distraction and ‘knowing where to look’ were significant concerns. © 2015, Springer-Verlag London.

AB  - This descriptive study examines online assessment strategies employed by preservice teacher candidates when creating thematic learning experiences in online teaching environments. Using the learning management system Moodle as part of their innovative training, this review of a sample of 395 candidate-created instructional units across all grades and most subject areas examines their use of a variety of assessment instruments to gather both formative and summative data. The large data set allowed the researcher to infer the teacher candidates' understanding of the value of different assessment types and their use in an assessment strategy for the unit. Learning management systems have many built-in affordances, including the ability for teachers to make quizzes, host discussion forums, use concept mapping, and facilitate collaborative projects using multimedia as well as text. In this study, the majority of students cautiously made use of more traditional tools such as quizzes and reports without taking full advantage of the power and potential of collaborative and creative potential in the development of authentic assessments. Analysis of these data showed that teacher candidates at the upper elementary level and in subjects like Science and Language Arts made far greater use of open-ended summative assessment activities than did other subgroupings. © 2016, © 2016 ISTE.

AB  - Explicit visual representations of domain knowledge have the potential to support students engaged in scientific inquiry learning activities on an epistemic level. This can be facilitated using computational methods for the extraction of concepts from student generated knowledge artefacts such as hypotheses, concept maps, or wiki articles. We propose an application of this approach in the context of inquiry learning with online science laboratories. As a cognitive awareness tool, the "concept cloud" presents domain concepts and key phrases to the learners in order to help them reflect on their own learning and knowledge building. As part of a learning analytics toolset, the concept cloud also supports teachers in supervising their students' knowledge building from an epistemic perspective. The approach has been tested in a classroom scenario with 84 secondary high school students. © 2016 IEEE.

AB  - To date, a look at the scientific literature on the construction and use of synchronous computer-mediated communication (CMC) support environments reveals that most researchers have focused either on exchanging information or on constructing and presenting posts. In this work, an intelligent collaborative synchronous CMC platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. The concept maps related to the learning topics are first outlined by the instructor. After each learner issues a post on the synchronous CMC platform, a feature selection approach is adopted to derive the input parameters of a one-class Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' posts are related to the concept maps previously outlined by the instructor. Meanwhile, learner peers from the same group are asked to provide comments on the synchronous CMCs, and a group grading module is established in this work to evaluate the quality of the synchronous CMCs. If the evaluation results from the classifier and the group grading module are inconsistent, the instructor or the teaching assistant is consulted to verify the evaluation results. Notably, a feedback rule construction mechanism is used to issue feedback messages to learners in cases where the synchronous CMC support system detects that the learners have strayed astray from the expected learning topics in their posts. The classification rates for the one-class SVM classifier can reach up to 97.06%, and the average pre-test and post-test grades were 51.94 and 66.77, respectively, which revealed that the junior high school students participating in synchronous CMC activities related to natural science were benefited by the proposed intelligent synchronous CMC platform. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - This article examines the efficacy of using concept mapping to identify the key dimensions that influence the use of research-based information by school practitioners, including teachers, educational counsellors, and school administrators. This mapping exercise was the first step in developing a competency framework for translation of research-based knowledge in education. Its aim was to provoke collective reflection of key stakeholders in the education sector who are already playing a role in knowledge transfer in their settings, to find out what should be done to make the scientific knowledge more useful to professional practices in schools. Altogether, the exercise identified eight domains that, according to respondents, influence the use of research in schools. These results were subsequently validated by three subgroups of participants and compared against the scientific literature on the topic to lay the foundation for identifying competencies that should be included in the framework. The map produced in the exercise described in this article presents a first picture of how things should be, in education, in order for teachers, educational counsellors, and school administrators to be informed by research-based information. The concept mapping methodology used in this study combined qualitative and quantitative approaches and was based on the active participation of key stakeholders. In the context of a project to develop a competency framework to foster knowledge translation, we consider this method to be appropriate and compares favourably with other group techniques. © The Author 2015.

AB  - Organic chemistry students struggle with multiple aspects of reaction mechanisms and the curved arrow notation used by organic chemists. Many faculty believe that an understanding of nucleophiles and electrophiles, among other concepts, is required before students can develop fluency with the electron-pushing formalism (EPF). An expert concept map was created to depict an understanding of nucleophiles and electrophiles ideally held by undergraduates. Second year organic chemistry students were interviewed and asked to give examples of nucleophiles and electrophiles and to identify them in reactions. A cognitive map was created to represent each student's understanding. The students' maps were compared to the expert map, revealing that students possess fragmented ideas about the structure and function of nucleophiles and electrophiles. © 2016 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Concept map as an effective tool allows learners to deal with an in depth analysis rather than keeping more information which is transferred through lecture based teaching. Concept map also improves the efficiency of computer assisted simulation techniques in learning environments. This research especially focuses on effectiveness of a computer simulated environment and concept mapping and its effect on conceptual understanding of science. In this study, we selected 60 high school students and divided them into two groups (30 students in Group A and 30 students in Group B). The goal of this research is to investigate how the concept maps influence the learning of Direct Current (DC) concept in electric circuits. We collected data by using Determining and Interpreting Resistive Electric Circuit Concepts Test (DIRECT). Covariance analysis indicates significant difference between two groups. Adjusted pretest scores also approve the significant effect of learning with simulation plus concept map in comparison with the sole simulation among learners (Partial eta Squared = 0.08; F = 4.84; p < 0.03). We conclude that students who used simulation along with a concept map (group B) showed better learning than students who used only a simulation software. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - In this paper, we will be carrying out an in-depth analysis of a series of investigations involving concept maps used in eye tracking methodology. First, the background to this kind of research is analyzed: on the one hand we will focus on generic scientific literature about those concept maps with theoretical foundations in the psychology of learning, and second the literature of eye tracking in teaching and learning will be reviewed. Finally, we will center our attention on the way in which the literature for these two areas overlaps. A total of 15 published works on concept maps using eye tracking were located and subsequently the quality of these papers, their visibility, topics, and results were analyzed. The findings show there are very few published works on this subject, all originated from dispersed sources which proved difficult to locate, despite the fact that eye tracking methodology lends itself perfectly to the study of concept maps. We predict that in coming years there will be many more publications in this field.

AB  - Background: Literature contends that a teacher’s knowledge of concept map-based tasks influence how their students perceive the task and execute the creation of acceptable concept maps. Teachers who are skilled concept mappers are able to (1) understand and apply the operational terms to construct a hierarchical/non-hierarchical concept map; (2) identify the legitimacy of the constructed concept map by verifying its graphical structure and its educational utility; and (3) determine the inherent ‘good’ and ‘poor’ qualities of the resulting graphical structure to reiterate the ‘good’ qualities and to coach and provide feedback to alleviate ‘poor’ qualities. Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate the nature of prospective teachers’ knowledge underpinning the technique used to construct concept maps and thus, explicate their facility to construct concept maps. Sample, Design and Methods: Data consisted of 200 concept maps constructed by prospective teachers in an elementary science methods course. Results: Analysis revealed that the prospective teachers had predominantly constructed either hierarchical and/or non-hierarchical concept maps. It is likely that their maps reflect the teaching that they themselves would have experienced in their science classrooms during their own education. Additionally, most of these concepts maps only contained the root concept and subordinate concepts and lacked directional linking lines, linking phrases, labelled lines and propositions. Conclusions: We argue that teacher educators need to assess their prospective teachers’ understanding of concept mapping in relation to the legitimacy (the nature and quality) of the end-products (graphical structures) of such practices. Prospective teachers also need to understand the educational utility of concept mapping in terms of how these end-products impact and/or effectuate learning. © 2015 NFER.

AB  - A comparative study was conducted between a traditional methodology for teaching scientific contents and an experimental methodology based on the construction of a didactic sequence using concept maps as a resource for teaching-learning. Four groups of students aged 9–10 were selected, two acting as Control Groups and two as Experimental Groups. The objective was to find out the differences between the selected educational methods, in terms of the learning that 4th grade students acquire. The results showed a higher degree of effectiveness on the teaching methods used in the EG against the methods used in the CG. Students in the CG did not remember on the long term the contents taught in a traditional way, which seems related to rote learning. By contrast, students using concept maps had a more meaningful learning. In conclusion, concept maps are an important resource for improving the acquisition of scientific knowledge in primary education. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - An important stage in any research inquiry is the development of research questions that need to be answered. The strategies to develop research questions should be defined and described, but few studies have considered this process in greater detail. This study explores pre-service science teachers’ research questions and the strategies they can engage in during inquiry. A total of 59 pre-service science teachers who attended an undergraduate Fieldwork Course participated in the study. A single, holistic case study design was used along with an open-ended questionnaire and documents for data collection. The questionnaire was conducted at the end of the course, and documented inquiry reports were analyzed. The results indicate there are 11 methods for defining driving questions. These range from consulting an instructor to group discussion; 21 different strategies can be produced using these methods. These research question defining methods and strategies should be applied as a coding scheme for future studies and expanded. Any research question defining strategies unfamiliar to pre-service science teachers, such as field trips, brainstorming, and concept maps, should then be taught. © 2016 by author/s.

AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non-mediated and drawn from personal experience. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

AB  - As constructing concept maps from scratch can be time consuming, this study explores critiquing given concept maps with deliberate errors as an alternative. A form of concept map that distinguishes between different levels, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), was used as an assessment and embedded learning tool. The technology-enhanced biology unit was implemented in four high school science classes (n = 93). Student dyads in each class were randomly assigned to the KIM generation (n = 41) or critique (n = 52) task. Dyads in the generation group created their own connections from a given list of concepts, while dyads in the critique group received a concept map that included commonly found errors. KIMs in both groups consisted of the same concepts. Findings indicate that generating or critiquing KIMs can facilitate the construction of cross-level connections. Furthermore, results suggest that critiquing concept maps might be a more time-efficient alternative to generating concept maps from scratch. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.

AB  - This article considers what might be taught to meet a widely held curriculum aim of students being able to understand research in a discipline. Expertise, which may appear as a ‘chain of practice’, is widely held to be underpinned by networks of understanding. Scientific research expertise is considered from this perspective. Within scientific disciplines, how research is conducted to solve different problems varies with concomitant effects on the validity of the data and the strengths of the claims made. Despite this variation, the overarching concepts of validity and reliability and the underpinning and interrelated network of more specific ‘concepts of evidence’ are applicable to understanding a wide range of research designs and the uncertainties in the resultant data and claims. These constituent ideas, which inter alia have been validated as relevant to professional and academic expertise, form an integrated knowledge base about evidence which can be visualised on a concept map. The network of ideas underpinning research expertise across scientific disciplines is outlined. Research from explicitly teaching the concepts of evidence is reported, and the implications for teaching and learning in science-based disciplines in HE are considered. © 2016, The Author(s).

AB  - General chemistry is the first undergraduate course in which students further develop their understanding of fundamental chemical concepts. Many of these fundamental topics highlight the numerous conceptual interconnections present in chemistry. However, many students possess incoherent knowledge structures regarding these topics. Therefore, effective assessments are needed to identify these interconnections. The use of concept-mapping and think-aloud interviews to investigate the knowledge structures of undergraduate organic chemistry students' regarding bonding concepts is the focus of this research study. Herein, we spotlight the bonding concepts of electronegativity and polar covalent bonds. In essence, the study found that understanding of electronegativity was weak among students with low concept map scores (LS students) compared to students with high concept map scores (HS students). Additionally, several common misconceptions of electronegativity were revealed through student interviews. An examination of LS student interviews further revealed that a lack of understanding of electronegativity led to a misunderstanding of polar covalent bonding. The think-aloud interviews were a reflection of the connections students made with the concepts of electronegativity and polar covalent bonding in their concept maps. Implications for the chemistry curriculum are also presented. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - The value of collaborative concept mapping in assisting students to develop an understanding of complex concepts across a broad range of basic and applied science subjects is well documented. Less is known about students' learning processes that occur during the construction of a concept map, especially in the context of clinical cases in veterinary medicine. This study investigated the unfolding collaborative learning processes that took place in real-time concept mapping of a clinical case by veterinary medical students and explored students' and their teacher's reflections on the value of this activity. This study had two parts. The first part investigated the cognitive and metacognitive learning processes of two groups of students who displayed divergent learning outcomes in a concept mapping task. Meaningful group differences were found in their level of learning engagement in terms of the extent to which they spent time understanding and co-constructing knowledge along with completing the task at hand. The second part explored students' and their teacher's views on the value of concept mapping as a learning and teaching tool. The students' and their teacher's perceptions revealed congruent and contrasting notions about the usefulness of concept mapping. The relevance of concept mapping to clinical case-based learning in veterinary medicine is discussed, along with directions for future research. © 2014 AAVMC.

AB  - The aim of this study is to reveal teacher educators’ views of model and also to determine their mental models about it. Phenomenographic research design has been carried out in this study. The sample of study consists of 14 teacher educators from education faculties of diferent universities in Turkey. Semi-structured interviews that consisted of 7 questions were used to collect data. Besides, sample was asked draw a concept map on “model” in the last interview question. Results have shown that teacher educators give similar responses including unqualifed explanations to the interview questions related to the defnition of model, characteristics of them, and the objectives of using models. It can also be asserted, that teacher educators do not have scientifc understanding on the modeling process. The analyses of their responses to the interview questions and their concept maps have shown that most of the teacher educators in the sample have proximate or goal oriented mental models of the “model”. Considering the results, it is suggested that teacher educators should not only follow the new theories, methods, or the applications in related literature theoretically, but also employ diferent theories, methods, or applications such as models and modeling in their courses. © 2014 (publisher name), All right resereved.

AB  - It is possible that e-textbook readers and tablet PC's will become mainstream reading devices in the future. However, knowledge about instructional design in this field of learning sciences is inadequate. This study aimed to analyse how two factors, that is, presentation methods and concept maps, interact with cognitive load and learning outcomes when the contents of e-textbooks are compiled. Further, it endeavored to suggest an adequate logic of instructional design based on the findings. An empirical method was adopted, and 78 participants - either undergraduates or graduates in college - were recruited. Regarding the compilation of e-textbooks, the findings can be summarised as follows: (a) Providing concept maps not only reduces learners' cognitive load but also enhances their learning outcomes of cognition, affection, and psychomotor performance. (b) Overall, video (V) is superior to text and diagram interaction (TDI) in terms of learning outcomes, and TDI is superior to text and diagram (T&D). Nevertheless, within the cognitive domain, learning outcomes produced by V are not necessarily superior to those produced by TDI. When learners are not provided with concept maps, TDI is superior to V in terms of learning outcomes. Conversely, if learners are provided with concept maps, V is superior to TDI. © Australasian Journal of Educational Technology 2014.

AB  - We present research carried out with university students taking the subject "Concept Maps in Teaching" within the Master's Degree on Research in Teaching and Learning of the Experimental Sciences. The objective of this study was to elaborate a reasoning model, created using concept maps, that captures modes of thinking of expert teachers about solving kinematics problems. This model, used as a framework for those with less expertise in a particular form of argumentation, identifies approaches to solving certain types of problems. This paper focuses on the creation, utilisation, and validation of a reasoning model for solving kinematics problems. This model may apply to other types of learning content (concepts, procedures, but primarily arguments). The study was conducted during a school year with 60 students using a pre-test and post-test method to quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning model developed in problem solving. The statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the performance of the experimental and control groups. The results suggest that the development and use of this type of metareasoning, which is necessary for building a reasoning model, are of great help in teaching our students to reason about kinematics problem solving.

AB  - The "mole" is a fundamental concept in quantitative chemistry, yet research has shown that the mole is one of the most perplexing concepts in the teaching and learning of chemistry. This paper provides a survey of the relevant literature, identifies the necessary components of a sound understanding of the mole concept, and unpacks and presents these components in the form of a concept map. The concept map incorporates the atomic-molecular concept with the mole concept, and connects the two concepts by two linking ideas: the number aspect of the SI definition (linking idea 1) and the connection between relative atomic-molecular mass and molar mass (linking idea 2). This concept map not only provides a conceptual framework for making meaning in relation to the mole but also sheds some light on how the concept might be better taught and learned. © 2014 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Knowledge is not simply a collection of facts, principles, and formulas; instead, meaningful knowledge is organized around core concepts that guide peoples’ thinking about a subject. Therefore, knowledge organization is recognized as an important component of understanding learning and teaching. In this research, knowledge organization of two physics university textbooks was compared with that of four physics university teachers. The topic studied was magnetostatics with an emphasis on two topics of Biot-Savart law and Ampère’s law. The aim of study was to examine the structural features of the subject matter knowledge of teachers and textbooks. For this reason, concept maps were utilized to picture clearly their knowledge organizations. Concept maps were evaluated by means of a focus on their structural characteristics including hierarchy and clustering. Results indicate that the hierarchical organizations between knowledge of teachers and textbooks vary from one topic to another. The hierarchical organizations of teachers are more comparable to textbooks for the topic of Biot-Savart law. The clustering behaves in a very similar way in the case of patterns between textbooks and teachers for both topics. It was observed that the knowledge arrangements of Ampère’s law were more hierarchical, while the knowledge organizations of Biot-Savart were more clustered. Moreover, structural properties varied from one topic to another, even though topics belong to the same context. The possibility of recognizing such difference in knowledge organization is a first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solutions. © 2013, National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - Concept mapping and retrieval practice are both educational methods that have separately been reported to provide significant benefits for learning in diverse settings. Concept mapping involves diagramming a hierarchical representation of relationships between distinct pieces of information, whereas retrieval practice involves retrieving information that was previously coded into memory. The relative benefits of these two methods have never been tested against each other in a classroom setting. Our study was designed to investigate whether or not concept mapping or retrieval practice produced a significant learning benefit in an undergraduate physiology course as measured by exam performance and, if so, was the benefit of one method significantly greater than the other. We found that there was a trend toward increased exam scores for the retrieval practice group compared with both the control group and concept mapping group, and that trend achieved statistical significance for one of the four module exams in the course. We also found that women performed statistically better than men on the module exam that contained a substantial amount of material relating to female reproductive physiology.

AB  - Funded by the Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (COSEE) program of the National Science Foundation (NSF), COSEE-Ocean Systems (OS) has employed concept mapping to facilitate collaboration and communication between ocean scientists and educators. Based on iterative feedback from and interaction with its participants, COSEE-OS has developed online concept mapping software linked to an ever-growing database with thousands of scientist-vetted resources, known as the Concept Linked Integrated Media Builder (CLIMB; cosee.umaine. edu/climb). Concomitant with the evolution of its CLIMB software functionality, COSEE-OS has transitioned from exclusively holding in-person concept mapping workshops to predominantly preparing for and delivering concept map-based webinar events, featuring ocean science researchers. This transition to webinars has greatly increased the number of participants and expanded the geographic reach from local to global. This chapter focuses on three key areas in which COSEE-OS has supported critical thinking: (1) the collaborative process of making meaningful learning by creating, analyzing, and improving concept maps with others; (2) facilitating subject-matter experts in the formulation of concept map-based presentations, which audiences can use to evaluate the validity of their connections and conclusions; and (3) the training of scientists to use concept mapping as a technique to more clearly delineate and explain how their research is tied to societally relevant issues. Three case descriptions on how COSEE-OS concept mapping facilitation and infrastructure have been applied to ocean sciences education efforts-both within the COSEE Network and beyond to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)-are also presented. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - Knowledge is getting increasingly more complex. Learners, from Kindergarten to higher education, require powerful tools to connect complex ideas. This paper explores the range of studies that investigated concept maps as learning, metacognitive, collaborative, and assessment tools to support integrating complex ideas. Research suggests that concept maps can be successfully implemented in a wide variety of settings, from K12 to higher and professional education. However, the effectiveness of concept maps depends on different factors, such as concept map training and choosing a suitable form of concept map to match the task and learner. Developing proficiency in concept mapping takes time and practice and should not be first introduced in higher education. Concept map training could start as early as Kindergarten and include concept map generation, interpretation, and revision. This paper concludes that, if implemented thoughtfully, concept maps can be versatile tools to support knowledge integration processes towards a deeper understanding of the relations and structures of complex ideas and facilitate life-long learning.

AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose–insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary (n = 15), concept map (n = 16), model (n = 23), and outlined model (n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students’ learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - In this study, we developed teaching materials and lesson plans to expand students' understanding of fundamental engineering principles through experimentation with and manufacturing of real products. The products used for this study were a model car and a walking model. With the development of these products as a specific objective and not using special equipment, we aimed to enable students to learn and utilize one of fundamental discipline in engineering, mechanics. The products were introduced in a lecture format class and the effectiveness of the lesson plan was evaluated. Results of the evaluations administered at the beginning and the end of the class showed that the students obtained a greater understanding of mechanics by engaging in the design and production of the two products. Concept maps created by the students showed that through the lesson, they improved their ability to apply scientific knowledge to experimental investigation and manufacturing processes. Moreover, results of a survey questionnaire suggested an improvement in students' aptitude for and confidence in applying scientific knowledge to real problems, including experiments and product manufacturing. © 2012, Society for Experimental Mechanics.

AB  - Virtual Forest is a web-based, open-access learning environment about forests designed for primary-school pupils between the ages of 10 and 13 years. It is pedagogically designed to develop an understanding of ecology, to enhance conceptual development and to give a holistic view of forest ecosystems. Various learning tools, such as concept maps, activating questions, self-assessment, and other exercises, can be implemented to achieve these goals. The information is presented using the capabilities of hypermedia. The interactive systematic wholeness of nature is presented for the learners, within the context of a forest ecosystem and with examples of a few core ecological phenomena, including the cycling of matter, the flow of energy and population dynamics. The e-learning environment is designed to be used for blended learning, together with face-to-face instruction. Virtual Forest is about Finnish forests, but the pedagogical framework can be adapted for biological education in general. © 2014 Society of Biology.

AB  - Concept maps have been extensively used in education, especially in science teaching. There is strong evidence that their use is associated with increased knowledge transfer and retention across several instructional conditions, settings and methodological features. However, constructing a concept map is complex and difficult for students, especially newbies. Consequently, there is a necessity to provide feedback to the learners during the authoring of their concept maps. There are several concept-mapping tools that provide feedback but none of them provide immediate or just-in-time (JIT) feedback. This kind of feedback is important for two reasons: First, low achieving or low mastery students benefit greatly from this type of feedback. Second, when students start out badly, with incorrect propositions, they tend to continue with further incorrect propositions until the map is grossly incorrect and JIT feedback could prevent this situation. This paper presents a practical application of Ohlsson's theory of learning from performance errors to provide JIT feedback during the construction of concept maps. It is shown that by creating an Entity-Relationship (E-R) schema that incorporates additional elements into the standard schema for concept maps, the schema can be implemented with Datalog, benefiting from the use of its deductive features to provide immediate feedback to the learner. Finally, some field related examples are provided. ©2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study explored the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and its development of four experienced biology teachers in the context of teaching school genetics. PCK was defined in terms of teacher content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of students’ preconceptions and learning difficulties. Data sources of teacher knowledge base included teacher-constructed concept maps, pre- and post-lesson teacher interviews, video-recorded genetics lessons, post-lesson teacher questionnaire and document analysis of teacher's reflective journals and students’ work samples. The results showed that the teachers’ individual PCK profiles consisted predominantly of declarative and procedural content knowledge in teaching basic genetics concepts. Conditional knowledge, which is a type of meta-knowledge for blending together declarative and procedural knowledge, was also demonstrated by some teachers. Furthermore, the teachers used topic-specific instructional strategies such as context-based teaching, illustrations, peer teaching, and analogies in diverse forms but failed to use physical models and individual or group student experimental activities to assist students’ internalization of the concepts. The finding that all four teachers lacked knowledge of students’ genetics-related preconceptions was equally significant. Formal university education, school context, journal reflection and professional development programmes were considered as contributing to the teachers’ continuing PCK development. Implications of the findings for biology teacher education are briefly discussed. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Introduction: We conducted a mixed methods study from June 2014 to March 2015 to assess the perspectives of stakeholders in networks that adopt a population approach for chronic disease prevention (CDP). The purpose of the study was to identify important and feasible outcome measures for monitoring network performance. Methods: Participants from CDP networks in Canada completed an online concept mapping exercise, which was followed by interviews with network stakeholders to further understand the findings. Results: Nine concepts were considered important outcomes of CDP networks: enhanced learning, improved use of resources, enhanced or increased relationships, improved collaborative action, network cohesion, improved system outcomes, improved population health outcomes, improved practice and policy planning, and improved intersectoral engagement. Three themes emerged from participant interviews related to measurement of the identified concepts: the methodological difficulties in measuring network outcomes, the dynamic nature of network evolution and function and implications for outcome assessment, and the challenge of measuring multisectoral engagement in CDP networks. Conclusion: Results from this study provide initial insights into concepts that can be used to describe the outcomes of networks for CDP and may offer foundations for strengthening network outcome-monitoring strategies and methodologies.

AB  - Biomechanics education is a vital component of kinesiology, sports medicine, and physical education, as well as for many biomedical engineering and bioengineering undergraduate programmes. Little research exists regarding effective teaching strategies for biomechanics. However, prior work suggests that student learning in undergraduate physics courses has been aided by using the Just-in-Time Teaching (JiTT). As physics understanding plays a role in biomechanics understanding, the purpose of study was to evaluate the use of a JiTT framework in an undergraduate biomechanics course. This two-year action-based research study evaluated three JiTT frameworks: (1) no JiTT; (2) mathematics-based JiTT; and (3) concept-based JiTT. A pre- and post-course assessment of student learning used the biomechanics concept inventory and a biomechanics concept map. A general linear model assessed differences between the course assessments by JiTT framework in order to evaluate learning and teaching effectiveness. The results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in a concept-based JiTT course, relative to a mathematics-based JiTT or no JiTT course structure. These results suggest that a course structure involving concept-based questions using a JiTT strategy may be an effective method for engaging undergraduate students and promoting learning in biomechanics courses. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Context-based education, in which students deal with biological concepts in a meaningful way, is showing promise in promoting the development of students conceptual coherence. However, literature gives little guidance about how this kind of education should be designed. Therefore, our study aims at designing and evaluating the practicability of a context-based biology lesson sequence. Four design principles for conceptual coherence were defined: build upon familiar concepts; focus on core concepts; stimulate establishing connections between concepts; and reflect on these connections. These design principles have been elaborated into a lesson sequence about concepts related to cellular metabolism and the relevant connections between the concepts have been visualised in a reference concept map. The activities of teacher and students that were expected to contribute in establishing these connections were described in a research scenario. The lesson sequence was conducted in a 10th-grade class of 21 students, aged 15-16, in senior general secondary education. Data were collected from video-recordings in the classroom. The observed activities of the teacher and students were compared with the intended activities. The findings show that a research scenario is a powerful tool to systematically evaluate the design and to provide information for improving it. © 2014 Society of Biology.

However, the abstract and complex mathematical nature of the concepts involved in signal analysis and the disconnection of these concepts from daily life continue to pose a challenge in conceptually understanding signal analysis. This study addresses the mistakes and learning hurdles faced by electrical engineering undergraduate students while learning signal analysis and suggests possible reasons for these misconceptions and learning hurdles. The results of this study are established with the difficulties that appeared throughout the development of a detailed concept map of signal analysis using Fourier analysis techniques; during discussions with the experts in signal analysis; and from student responses to the questions in class tests and later during individual interviews. This study identifies the difficulties in conceptually learning signal analysis that arise from insufficient understanding of: (1) the difference between continuous and discrete domains, (2) discrete frequency, (3) units of Fourier series and Fourier transforms, (4) periodic/aperiodic or finite/infinite duration signals, (5) sampling, (6) aliasing and folding, (7) abstract mathematical concepts, and (8) advanced mathematical thinking ability. A few possible explanations for these learning hurdles are various p-prims, ontological miscategorization of discrete and continuous domain signals, and the lack of ability among students for advanced mathematical thinking. The knowledge of difficult concepts and the reasons behind the difficulties in learning signal analysis related topics is necessary for the design of an appropriate pedagogy for signal analysis related courses. While teaching signal analysis, careful attention to these learning hurdles and the possible related explanations will help to establish meaningful learning among students. © 2015 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - With the prevalence of web-based learning, the application of concept mapping, as a powerful diagnostic and instructional tool, has been widely exploited in both education and computer science. In recent years, several methods have been presented to automatically construct concept map that achieved encouraging results, while ignoring some critical issues when applied in actual E-learning system. In this paper, we propose a practical approach for constructing concept map, which is adapted to the dynamic character of a real system. Moreover, we apply fuzzy set theory and fuzzy reasoning basis on fuzzy rules for similarity degree between two concepts, to find direct prerequisite relationship among concepts. It provides a useful way to improve accuracy and reduce complexity of the concept map. © 2014 IEEE.

AB  - Following collaboration between two chemistry lecturers and an academic developer an attempt was made to enhance the learning of students within a chemistry module through the adaptation of the delivery of content material. This paper reports a piece of practitioner led research which considered how effective the approach developed was upon the level of student understanding and the process through which this occurred. The module delivery was altered from an emphasis on the transmission of knowledge through a traditional lecture format, to rotating small group problem based sessions and the use of concept maps. Student feedback and higher grades achieved appear to demonstrate it was effective. © 2015 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Background: To study the association between organizational context and research utilization in German residential long term care (LTC), we translated three Canadian assessment instruments: the Alberta Context Tool (ACT), Estabrooks' Kinds of Research Utilization (RU) items and the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale. Target groups for the tools were health care aides (HCAs), registered nurses (RNs), allied health professionals (AHPs), clinical specialists and care managers. Through a cognitive debriefing process, we assessed response processes validity-an initial stage of validity, necessary before more advanced validity assessment. Methods. We included 39 participants (16 HCAs, 5 RNs, 7 AHPs, 5 specialists and 6 managers) from five residential LTC facilities. We created lists of questionnaire items containing problematic items plus items randomly selected from the pool of remaining items. After participants completed the questionnaires, we conducted individual semi-structured cognitive interviews using verbal probing. We asked participants to reflect on their answers for list items in detail. Participants' answers were compared to concept maps defining the instrument concepts in detail. If at least two participants gave answers not matching concept map definitions, items were revised and re-tested with new target group participants. Results: Cognitive debriefings started with HCAs. Based on the first round, we modified 4 of 58 ACT items, 1 ACT item stem and all 8 items of the RU tools. All items were understood by participants after another two rounds. We included revised HCA ACT items in the questionnaires for the other provider groups. In the RU tools for the other provider groups, we used different wording than the HCA version, as was done in the original English instruments. Only one cognitive debriefing round was needed with each of the other provider groups. Conclusion: Cognitive debriefing is essential to detect and respond to problematic instrument items, particularly when translating instruments for heterogeneous, less well educated provider groups such as HCAs. Cognitive debriefing is an important step in research tool development and a vital component of establishing response process validity evidence. Publishing cognitive debriefing results helps researchers to determine potentially critical elements of the translated tools and assists with interpreting scores. © 2014Hoben et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.

AB  - In the last decennium learning outcomes became a key factor in quality assurance in higher education in Europe causing an increased interest in methodologies for specifying learning outcomes of a study programme. At the Faculty of Engineering Science, KU Leuven, the ACQA (Academic Competence and Quality Assurance) framework [1] was adopted and implemented. Competence profiles based on ACQA criteria were compiled for all engineering programmes and actively used in accreditation procedures, quality assurance and curriculum development [2]. Despite the proven value of the use of learning outcomes and competence profiles in curriculum development, education developers at the Faculty of Engineering Science felt a need for additional tools to analyse the curriculum with the feeling of ownership as an important additional scope. The use of concepts to analyse the curriculum felt to be very approachable and open to large groups of lecturers. In general, concept mapping is a visual representation of ideas designed to illustrate the relationships between ideas. Previous experiences with concept mapping as a tool for course design proved to be inspiring to elaborate these principles to a curriculum level. In this paper, we will describe the use of concepts and concept mapping as an innovative tool for curriculum development. The use of diverse formats of concept mapping at the Faculty of Engineering Science will be described and discussed in the context of qualitative support in curriculum development.

AB  - The Go-Lab federation of online labs opens up virtual laboratories (simulation), remote laboratories (real equipment accessible at distance) and data sets from physical laboratory experiments (together called “online labs”) for large-scale use in education. In this way, Go-Lab enables inquiry-based learning that promotes acquisition of deep conceptual domain knowledge and inquiry skills, with the further intent of interesting students in careers in science. For students, Go-Lab offers the opportunity to perform scientific experiments with online labs in pedagogically structured learning spaces. Go-Lab’s inquiry learning spaces (ILSs) structure the students’ inquiry process through an inquiry cycle and provide students with guidance in which dedicated (and connected) scaffolds for inquiry processes play a pivotal role. Teachers can create and adapt inquiry learning phases and the associated guidance in an ILS through a simple wiki-like interface and can add scaffolds and tools to an ILS using a straightforward drag and drop feature. Teachers can also adapt scaffolds and tools (e.g., change the language or the concepts available in a concept mapper) through an “app composer”. In creating ILSs, teachers are supported by scenarios and associated defaults ILSs that can be used as a starting point for development. In addition, teachers are offered a community framework to disseminate best practices and find mutual support. For lab-owners, Go-Lab provides open interfacing solutions for easily plugging in their online labs and sharing them in the Go-Lab federation of online labs. In its first year, Go-Lab created ILSs for thirteen online labs from different lab providers, including renowned research organizations (e.g., CERN, ESA) that participate in the consortium. The design of these inquiry learning spaces has been evaluated through mock-ups and prototypes with students and teachers. More advanced and later versions will be evaluated and validated in large scale pilots. The sustainability of Go-Lab will come from the opportunity for the larger science education community to add new online labs and share ILSs. An open and Web-based community will capitalize on the “collective intelligence” of students, teachers, and scientists. © 2014, de Jong et al.; licensee Springer.

AB  - Intelligent tutoring systems are beginning to include more varied forms of media, but little is known about how to choose the appropriate media and whether or not it should be animated. This study used a 2 (animated/static) x 2 (picture/concept map) factorial design in order to evaluate the effect of animation and media type on conceptual knowledge, relational knowledge, and free recall. Learners on Mechanical Turk (N = 208) were exposed to one of four conditions in which they viewed a modified Khan Academy video on cell parts. We found that animation induced higher learning gains when it comes to relational knowledge. For conceptual knowledge, animated concept maps outperformed animated pictures while static pictures produced slightly more learning than static concept maps. Our results indicate that using animations to slowly build complexity in visual displays is particularly important when the displays have a rich structure as in concept maps. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Recent school science curriculum developments in many countries emphasise that scientists derive evidence for their claims through different approaches; that such practices are bound up with disciplinary knowledge; and that the quality of data should be appreciated. This position paper presents an understanding of the validity of data as a set of conceptual relationships, illustrating the application of the network of ideas and their inter-relationships necessary for the ‘thinking behind the doing’ with examples from practice. We explore ways in which this understanding of data is inherently related to underpinning disciplinary ideas. We suggest how the recognition of a conceptual basis for understanding the quality of data represents an ontological shift with respect to widespread characterisations of scientific practices which addresses some long-standing issues in science education research, policy, curricula and practice. © 2015 British Educational Research Association.

AB  - Companion apps for television programmes provide additional, synchronized and interactive content on mobile devices such as tablets or smartphones. With the television screen they create dual screen interfaces with multiple modalities and require viewers to actively manage their visual attention. We outline a model of interactions with companion apps used with information-rich television programmes where a primary purpose of the app is to support understanding and learning. Our model summarises perceptual and cognitive processes involved by drawing on theories and findings from Human Factors and the learning sciences. We use the model to assess CompanionMap, an app for accompanying science documentaries with synchronized, animated concept maps. We show how the model provides explanations for four findings obtained from an experiment with CompanionMap, including how users managed their visual attention and how they learnt about astrophysics when using the app to watch an astronomy programme.

AB  - With a growing interest in sustainability, a number of universities have engaged in educating the future leaders, decision makers, scientists, and engineers on how their decisions can help societies become more sustainable. This paper presents the process for developing the Bachelor's degree curriculum in Engineering for Sustainable Development at Tecnológico de Monterrey, Mexico. The process was initiated in response to a request from top management of the university to a small committee of faculty members to prepare a draft of the degree's curriculum structure. Subsequently, a wider committee was appointed to design the courses' content and to refine the degree's structure. The process of developing a new degree posed a number of challenges, such as connectivity of courses and the curricular contribution to sustainability. These challenges were overcome by: using Concept Maps to help characterise and to overcome the challenges of inter-connecting courses by providing a systemic framework through a qualitative graphical tool titled, the 'Sustainability Tool for Assessing UNiversities' Curricula Holistically' (STAUNCH®). This tool helped the faculty team to develop a quasi-quantitative approach to the courses' coverage and their individual and collective contribution to education of their students for sustainability. The two methods provided a broader, more holistic, and systemic approach when developing a degree, because it allowed assessing the needed connectivity among curriculum courses from a systemic perspective, as well as evaluating the contribution of environmental, economic, and social issues in the degree. The systematic process followed in developing this degree curriculum can help other institutions to design and implement their own sustainability curricula. This can ensure that they develop sustainability-educated and empowered students, who can be change agents in making societies more sustainable. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Due to rapid advancement in the field of computer communication there has been a lot of research in development of Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). However ITS fails to pinpoint the exact concept the student is deficient in. We propose the development of an Intelligent Diagnostic and Remedial learning system which aims to diagnose the exact concept the student is deficient in. The proposed system composed of three modules is derived from David Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning which consists of three learning elements. The system is implemented in mobile environment using Android Emulator. Finally an experiment was conducted with a set of 60 students majoring in computer science. Experimental results clearly show that the system improves the performance of the learners for whom they are intended. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.

AB  - In this paper, we propose an initial structure to support a taxonomy for Web Observatories (WO). The work is based on a small sample of cases drawn from the work of the Web Science Trust and the Web Science Institute and reflects aspects of academic, business and government Observatories. Whilst this is early work it is hoped, by drawing broad brushstrokes at the edges of different types of Observatory, that future work based on a more systematic review will refine this model and hence refine our understanding of the nature of Observatories. We also seek here to enhance a faceted classification scheme (which is thought to be weak in the area of visualisation) through the use of simplified concept maps. © Copyright 2014 by the International World Wide Web Conferences Steering Committee.

AB  - Project Clarion, a Jacob K. Javits-funded project, focused on the scale-up of primary-grade science curricula. Curriculum units, based on an Integrated Curriculum Model (ICM), were developed for high-ability learners, but tried out with all students in Title I settings to study the efficacy of the units with all learners. The units focus on the development of students’ conceptual understanding to undergird science content attainment. Teaching and learning models, such as concept formation and concept mapping were used to scaffold science learning and reasoning for appropriate curriculum differentiation. Science content mastery was measured using the Metropolitan Achievement Tests. Reasoning skills were measured using the Test of Critical Thinking. Understanding of macro-concepts and content attainment were measured by curriculum-embedded performance-based assessments. Students with the ICM outperformed students without the specialized curriculum in science content and reasoning skills, and showed greater growth in both conceptual understanding and content attainment. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - During the last two decades it has been observed that there has been substantial advancement in the domain of E-Learning systems. This may be attributed to development in the field on networking and communication. However most of these systems lack face to face interaction between the learner and the tutor and hence are unable to pinpoint the learner deficiencies. In this context, several researchers have used Concept Maps for identifying student learning barriers. However a major drawback of Concept Map approach is that all concepts are given equal degree of importance from the learner point of view. In this work a Weighted Concept Map based approach is proposed to provide remedial learning guidance to the learners. The system works by generating automated Concept Map and assigning weights to the concepts based on their importance for computation of best remedial learning path. The approach has been tested with a set of middle school students for identifying their learning deficiencies in science courses and the results found to be satisfactory. © Springer India 2015.

AB  - As an interdisciplinary team of educational researchers we explored pre-service science teachers' perspectives on using digital technologies and social media to address socially relevant issues in science teaching. The rationale for teaching socially relevant science was embedded in the concept of renaiscience, thus underscoring the need for science to be perceived as a human activity. We drew on generational theory to consider the educational significance of digital technologies and social media. Two diffierent activities were used to elicit the pre-service science teachers' perspectives. First, we invited them to reflect on a digital animation that we had produced, and they highlighted the advantages of digital animation as a medium to communicate a socially relevant message more appealingly to the Millennial generation. We then engaged these pre-service teachers in a structured concept-mapping activity to consider how digital technologies and social media might be used to address social challenges in South Africa. They drew our attention to the affordances of digital technologies and social media as a means to facilitate critical thinking, cater for diverse learning styles, and make high-quality scientific knowledge more accessible. They highlighted that teaching socially relevant science using digital resources can be cheap, convenient, collaborative, and creative. © 2015 University of the Free State.

AB  - Over the past two decades, science educators increasingly have become interested in the role of language in the learning of science and have drawn on the work of Bakhtin, among others, for understanding the dialogical nature of knowledge in a sociocultural framework. However, the nature of language and its relation to thinking have not substantially changed and, in many ways, are incommensurable with the cultural-historical, materialist dialectical underpinning of the original framing of the sociocultural and dialogical approaches in the theories of L. S. Vygotsky and M. M. Bakhtin and his circle (e.g., V. N. Vološinov). Most importantly, currently available analyses of science classroom talk do not appear to exhibit sufficient appreciation of the fact that words, statements, and language are living phenomena, that is, they inherently change in speaking. In this paper, I begin by working out the premise that language is a living phenomenon that changes in use. I then present two key insights on language-in-use that derive from the works of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle, which are used to develop a theoretical and methodological frame. These key insights and the theoretical aspects of this paper are exemplified with materials from a concept mapping session in a 12th-grade physics course. The proposed model has considerable implications for theorizing the relation between classroom talk and formal written genres of expression, and gives rise to many newresearch questions. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This work-in-progreß report (Position Paper) presents a qualitative analysis of student-constructed concept maps in engineering dynamics-a high-enrollment, high-impact, foundational undergraduate engineering course. Using a computer software program called IHMC Cmap Tools, the students who participated in the present study constructed their own concept maps to demonstrate their understanding of a variety of concepts they had learned. The present study investigates students' purposes when they construct their own concept maps to learn. The results show that students construct their concept maps for five primary purposes: to describe the relationships among relevant concepts, to connect important equations, to illustrate the evolution of concepts, to incorporate figures into concept maps, and to integrate problem-solving procedures into concepts. These research findings help develop a better understanding of how students learn, and therefore may help instructors develop or adopt the most appropriate instructional strategies to improve student learning outcomes.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service science teachers' conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational beliefs, and self-regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a public university in Ankara participated the study. A concept map technique was used to determine students' conceptual knowledge level of electric current. To determine students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture and then used as a measurement tool. Results showed that students' motivational beliefs were positively associated with their self-regulation, and students' task value, self-efficacy, and self-regulation were positively related with students' conceptual knowledge of electric current. These results show that students' motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in students' conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map technique. © 2015 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research.

AB  - In this paper we describe the architecture of an e-learning environment that blends concept maps with Online Labs (OLabs) to enhance student performance in biology. In the Indian context, a secondary school student’s conceptual understanding of hard topics in biology is at risk because of a lack of qualified teachers and necessary equipments in labs to conduct experiments. Concept map provides a visual framework which allows students to get an overview of a concept, its various sub concepts and their relationships and linkages. OLabs with its animations, videos and simulations is an interactive, immersive approach for practicing science experiments. The blended e-learning environment was tested by systematically developing a concept map for the concept “Photosynthesis” and by successfully integrating it into the OLabs environment. Our blended approach to concept understanding has interesting implications for the teacher who is engaged in training programs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The algebra based Introductory Physics course is offered to all students majoring in Chemistry, Biology, and Technology. There has been extensive research on teaching this course over the past five decades, and many people have investigated it from different aspects, such as the knowledge structure construction and procedural thinking in problem solving. From our experience in teaching this course, we find that there is another intrinsic issue that has attracted little attention. Newtonian Mechanics is an excellent topic for students to learn how to solve problems with a systematic knowledge base. However, for many students, this topic is just a collection of equations. We believe that it is helpful to provide an integration process after teaching the individual chapters. In addition, with a complete concept map in mind, students can appreciate the elegant structure of the theory and analyze problems more effectively. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2015.

AB  - Concept mapping is a pedagogical technique that was developed in the 1970s and is being used in K–12 and postsecondary education. Although it has shown excellent results in other fields, it is still rare in political science. In this research note, I discuss the implementation and testing of concept mapping in my Advanced Introduction to International Relations course. I find that student self-reporting indicates that this approach has a positive impact on student comprehension of texts and learning in the course. I suggest improvements that I intend to implement with the technique, as well as a future research agenda. © 2015, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The Aquarius satellite mission and Salinity Processes in the Upper-ocean Regional Study (SPURS) are providing the scientific community with new insights into the role seawater salinity plays in the Earth system. Aquarius and SPURS scientists and engineers, working with the University of Maine-based Salinity Public Engagement and Communications team, developed webinars that focused on how these programs’ findings increase knowledge about topics such as the water cycle, ocean circulation, and climate. Direct involvement of research scientists and engineers was key to the success of these efforts. These experts learned how to use interactive concept maps to “deconstruct” scientific content into simpler graphical formats for their presentations. A benefit to webinar participants, presenters, and facilitators was that they honed their critical thinking skills. In addition, the webinars allow people traditionally not represented in science, technology, engineering and math to gain better access to high-quality NASA materials. Post-event audience evaluation data provide valuable feedback on the impacts of sharing the results of ocean salinity research beyond the scientific community. © 2015 by The Oceanography Society.

AB  - Given the vast amount of information readily available through the Internet in different forms of representation, learners need to organize their knowledge strategically in order to make a sound argument, especially on a complex topic such as socioscientific issues. In this study, we designed a science unit on nuclear energy using a newly developed online knowledge and learning management system that offers three types of representations: pictorial, textual, and concept maps. We investigated how learners organized their knowledge with multiple external representations and how their knowledge organization practices interacted with their argumentation. Our results indicated that concept maps and wiki entries were more connected than the pictorial modes in the network of knowledge entries created by the learners. Moreover, we found evidence showing that students' knowledge organization enabled them to draw information while arguing and that their argumentation guided them to advance their knowledge organization practices. © 2014 ISLS.

AB  - While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework (n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development. © 2014 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - Much of the knowledge in technology domains is "how-to" knowledge that offers solutions to problems, or means to achieve desired ends. In previous work we illustrated how i*-based goal modeling can be used to map out the state of the art in a technical domain, detect gaps, and recognize advances. Our recent work, which includes user studies, suggests that the full expressiveness of i* may not be necessary for mapping know-how. In this paper, we propose ME-maps, a know-how mapping technique inspired by, but simpler than i*, with the aim of easier and wider adoption. We propose to use CmapTools, a widely-used platform for concept mapping, to support the collaborative construction and sharing of know-how maps. Lessons learned from this initiative could potentially inform the ongoing evolution and refinement of i*.

AB  - Researching conceptual understanding and development in learning requires recording and evaluating students' knowledge structures, either collaboratively or individually formed, but also requires investigating equally the learning process as well as the learning outcomes. The dynamic nature of knowledge maps, their potential as a life-long learning strategy, and their evaluation through a valid assessment protocol could serve those requirements. The following chapter records a case study in which 16 sixth grade students (10 years old) participated of a Greek state elementary school of an urban area, randomly selected. The students constructed and revised digital knowledge maps at various phases of a Science course both individually and in pairs. The research process involved collecting a succession of individually and collaboratively constructed knowledge maps. The series of knowledge maps was evaluated with a specifi cally designed protocol to assess multiple aspects of the knowledge structure process. The research aims at highlighting knowledge maps as a more sensitive assessment method of the learning process, compared to traditional tests and at underlining their effective use as a monitoring and assessment tool in collaborative environments. Results showed that graphics such concepts maps are more sensitive to subtle changes in student's understanding. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - This paper presents a study on the role of the teacher in computer-supported class group activities. We discuss various teacher tools that support this role. In the reported studies the students are engaged in group activities through networked computers. Typically they use a two-space collaboration tool. One shared space used for jointly producing a diagrammatic representation (concept map or other form of diagram), and one for text based communication. The group activities have a time span of typical classes: i.e. a few minutes to a few hours. In this context, we focus on the study of typical teacher actions and used representations and on the support that the tools used provided to the teacher for supervision of the class and group activities. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Learning to learn has become a widely debated issue, both politically and among the international scientific community, yet confusion remains about the difference between learning and learning to learn. Furthermore, in the scientific literature there is little agreement concerning definitions of the latter concept. The aim of this chapter, therefore, is to describe learning to learn and identify its features through definitions taken from the literature. The ultimate goal is to provide a sound theoretical basis for the further study of learning to learn from an empirical perspective and for more precise use of this notion in diverse learning settings. The methodology is a literature review yielding 40 definitions from 90 studies examined. Other products of these analyses on learning to learn (including a concept map and a list of practical functions leading eventually to a meta-definition and a process and output model) are based upon subsequent elaboration of this material, and reference to international literature on learning to learn and to Maria Montessori’s works. © 2014 Ruth Deakin Crick, Cristina Stringher and Kai Ren.

AB  - This paper presents the results of an experiment regarding the effects of using one of two different programming environments in secondary schools. Both "Scratch" and "Karel the Robot" have been successfully used in these settings previously. These two environments are also representative for two classes of programming environments for beginners. One is more graphically oriented and may therefore alleviate the steep learning curve of programming while the other is text-based and therefore more akin to"real"programming. Also, one places more emphasis on the visualization of program structure and the other emphasizes visualizing program ow. The experiment has been conducted in parallel in two school classes, each using one of the two approaches. The abilities of the students were tested before and after the experiment as well as their intrinsic motivation and the perceived self-regulation. The results show, that the class using Scratch has higher intrinsic motivation and performs better, however the Karel class shows a higher identified regulation. © 2014 Association for Computing Machinery.

AB  - Mind wandering (zoning out) can be detrimental to learning outcomes in a host of educational activities, from reading to watching video lectures, yet it has received little attention in the field of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). In the current study, participants self-reported mind wandering during a learning session with Guru, a dialogue-based ITS for biology. On average, participants interacted with Guru for 22 minutes and reported an average of 11.5 instances of mind wandering, or one instance every two minutes. The frequency of mind wandering was compared across five different phases of Guru (Common-Ground-Building Instruction, Intermittent Summary, Concept Map, Scaffolded Dialogue, and Cloze task), each requiring different learning strategies. The rate of mind wandering per minute was highest during the Common-Ground-Building Instruction and Scaffolded Dialogue phases of Guru. Importantly, there was significant negative correlation between mind wandering and learning, highlighting the need to address this phenomena during learning with ITSs. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - Social media are immensely popular among, and influential upon today’s youth. Previous media theories including Uses and Gratifications, Cultivation Analysis, and Media Ecology Theory have proposed ways in which media are used and can be influential. The rise of social media presents new challenges to existing behavioral and media theories. Recently, a new concept map called the Facebook Influence Model was developed to provide a conceptual approach to Facebook using primary data. This mixed-methods study applied concept mapping methodology, a validated five-step method to visually represent complex topics. The five steps include preparation, brainstorming, sort and rank, analysis, and interpretation. College student participants were identified using purposeful sampling. A total of 169 statements were generated during brainstorming and sorted into between 6 and 22 groups. The final concept map included 13 clusters. Interpretation of the data led to grouping of clusters into four final domains including: connection, comparison, identification, and Facebook as an experience. The Facebook Influence Concept Map illustrates key constructs that contribute to influence, incorporating perspectives of older adolescent Facebook users. While Facebook provides a novel lens through which to consider behavioral influence, it can best be considered in the context of existing behavioral theory. The concept map may be used towards development of potential future intervention efforts. © 2016 Giuseppe Riva, Brenda K. Wiederhold, Pietro Cipresso.

AB  - Reflection has recently been emphasized as a constructive pedagogical activity. However, little attention has been given to the quality of reflections that students write. In this study, we explored the reflections that students make about their knowledge organization as part of a formative learning activity. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge structures of Grade 11 physics students and their instructors using pathfinder networks (PFnets). Each student’s knowledge structure was compared with the instructors’ averaged knowledge structure in order to identify student misconceptions. As an intervention, students were asked to write reflections on the discrepancies between their knowledge structure and their instructors’ averaged knowledge structure. The students’ reflections were divided into the following three categories depending on the type of knowledge constructed in those reflections: (1) conceptual, (2) procedural, or (3) declarative. Evidence was provided by the study that reflection was an effective means of improving students’ knowledge structure. However, conceptual reflections were the most effective, followed by procedural and declarative reflection. Implications for formative classroom assessment are discussed. © 2015, Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students conceptions. © 2015 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - To support effective science teaching, educators need methods to reveal student understandings and misconceptions of science concepts and to offer all students an opportunity to reflect on their own knowledge construction and organization. Students can benefit by engaging in scientific activities in which they build personal connections between what they learn and their own experiences. Integrating studentconstructed concept mapping into the science curriculum can reveal to both students and teachers the conceptual organization and understanding of science content, which can assist in building connections between concepts and personal experiences. This chapter describes how a class of third grade students used concept maps to understand science concepts (specifically, "watershed systems"). During class discussions and interviews, students revised concept map content and structure as their ideas developed. The study's results demonstrate how students' critical thinking (self-reflection and revision) was supported as misconceptions were revealed through their construction of concept maps over time. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - The act of doing research, reviewing recent literature, checking data, and articulating results and meanings are important but not enough when working with scientific publications in graduate schools. A vital part of the work is authoring an informative text that can be clear enough as to communicate findings of the study and, at the same time, reinforce chosen arguments. This chapter focuses on an experiment at a renowned Brazilian graduate school of education, which uses concept mapping and collective assessment of such maps as fundamental pre-writing stages to guide the authorship of well-thought, well-knit scientific/argumentative texts. Results indicate that the experiment was successful in making students negotiate meanings, clarify ideas and purposes, and write in an academically acceptable style. All this was conducted from a methodological standpoint that makes meaningful knowledge, collective construction, and the reflective, critical work of the author (from the first draft to the final collectively written version given), the foundations to perform a better job at communicating the processes and results of the investigative work. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - While the utility of concept mapping has been widely reported in primary and secondary educational contexts, its application in the health sciences in higher education has been less frequently noted. Two case studies of the application of concept mapping in undergraduate and postgraduate health sciences are detailed in this paper. The case in undergraduate dental education examines the role of concept mapping in supporting problem-based learning and explores how explicit induction into the principles and practices of CM has add-on benefits to learning in an inquiry-based curriculum. The case in postgraduate medical education describes the utility of concept mapping in an online inquiry-based module design. Specific attention is given to applications of CMapTools™ software to support the implementation of Novakian concept mapping in both inquiry-based curricular contexts.

AB  - The goal of care mapping in the clinical setting in undergraduate nursing education is to determine the student's ability to collect, present, and connect relevant data points in order to evaluate and understand the medical plan of care and to develop a priority based nursing plan of care. This same process can be utilized across all health science education programs. The purpose of this chapter is to share how the author has modified the traditional concept map tool to a more user friendly format and to present a process of implementation that may be used in the clinical setting as part of any undergraduate health science program. The benefits of such an implementation are that of more enriched learning to include the development of critical thinking skills, the use of a common sense approach, and the recognition of the patient as a holistic being. © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - Digital knowledge maps are rich sources of information to track students' learning. However, making sense of concept maps has been found challenging. Using multiple quantitative and qualitative methods in combination allows triangulating of changes in students' understanding. This chapter introduces novel form of concept map, called knowledge integration map (KIM), and uses KIMs as examples for an overview of concept map analysis methods. Kims are a form of digital knowledge maps. Kims have been implemented in high school science classrooms to facilitate and assess complex science topics, such as evolution. Kim analysis aims to triangulate changes in learners' conceptual understanding through a multilevel analysis strategy, combining quantitative and qualitative methodologies. Quantitative analysis included overall, selected, and weighted propositional analysis using a knowledge integration rubric and network analysis describing changes in network density and prominence of selected concepts. Research suggests that scoring only selected propositions can be more sensitive to measuring conceptual change because it focuses on key concepts of the map. Qualitative analysis of KIMs included topographical analysis methods to describe the overall geometric structure of the map and qualitative analysis of link types. This chapter suggests that a combination of quantitative and qualitative analysis methods can capture different aspects of KIMs and can provide a rich description of changes in students' understanding of complex topics. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - In 1949 Donald Olding Hebb formulated a hypothesis describing how neurons excite each other and how the efficiency of this excitation subsequently changes with time. In this paper we present a review of this idea. We evaluate its influences on the development of artificial neural networks and the way we describe biological neural networks. We explain how Hebb's hypothesis fits into the research both of that time and of present. We highlight how it has gone on to inspire many researchers working on artificial neural networks. The underlying biological principles that corroborate this hypothesis, that were discovered much later, are also discussed in addition to recent results in the field and further possible directions of synaptic learning research. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

AB  - Although concept maps have been used as alternative assessment methods in education, there has been an ongoing debate on how to evaluate students' concept maps. This study discusses how to evaluate students' concept maps as an assessment tool before and after 15 computer-based Predict-Observe-Explain (CB-POE) tasks related to acid-base chemistry. 12 high school students participated in this study. Students' concept maps were evaluated taking into account three parts: qualitative, quantitative and representational level. The results gathered from the quantitative analysis of the pre and post concept maps were analyzed using SPSS 17.0. The results showed that there is a significant difference between students' pre and post concept map scores (z = 3.05; p < 0.05). From the qualitative analysis of the concept maps, the majority of the students constructed their pre and post concept maps non-hierarchically; while they drew more interconnected concept maps after the CB-POE tasks. Regarding their representational level, the students used the macroscopic level more often than microscopic and symbolic levels in both their pre and post concept maps. Nonetheless, they increased the number of macroscopic, microscopic and symbolic level representations in their post concept maps. The paper concludes with suggestions and implications for educators and researchers to improve the quality of concept map evaluation. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Introduction: The study of pharmacology involves considerable memorisation of drug classes, individual drug names, and mechanisms of action, as well as other characteristics including side effects, drug interactions, and therapeutic uses. The voluminous memorisation involved in basic and clinical pharmacology represents a challenging task, especially considering the continuous rate at which new drugs enter the market, and given that generic and trade names often are used interchangeably. Description of Educational Tool (Pharmacology Guide): Our comprehensive table consists of common affixes and roots of generic drugs that we have found beneficial to the study and retention of pharmacology. Our table includes important aspects of over fifty different drug classes including prototypes, mechanisms of action, and pertinent references. Evaluation: Qualitative feedback indicates that students readily adopt this organised approach of using common affixes and roots when studying pharmacological drug classes. Future Plans: Pharmacology educators and students at various institutions worldwide should benefit from this organised approach for teaching and learning pharmacological information. As well, it is anticipated that new editions of this table can be readily adapted to parallel the continuous emergence of new drugs and drug classes. © 2014 FIP.

AB  - Developing systems thinking skills in school can provide useful tools to deal with a vast amount of medical and health information that may help learners in decision making in their future lives as citizen. Thus, there is a need to develop effective tools that will allow learners to analyze biological systems and organize their knowledge. Here, we examine junior high school students' systems thinking skills in the context of the human circulatory system. A model was formulated for developing teaching and learning materials and for characterizing students' systems thinking skills. Specifically, we asked whether seventh grade students, who studied about the human circulatory system, acquired systems thinking skills, and what are the characteristics of those skills? Concept maps were used to characterize students' systems thinking components and examine possible changes in the students' knowledge structure. These maps were composed by the students before and following the learning process. The study findings indicate a significant improvement in the students' ability to recognize the system components and the processes that occur within the system, as well as the relationships between different levels of organization of the system, following the learning process.Thus, following learning students were able to organize the systems' components and its processes within a framework of relationships, namely the students' systems thinking skills were improved in the course of learning using the teaching and learning materials. © 2014 Raved and Yarden.

AB  - Novakian Concept maps (N-Cmaps) and the hierarchical reductionism method are combined to create a new pedagogic architecture to address highcomplexity issues in classrooms. This strategy considers the epistemological challenge of managing a substantial amount of information from diverse disciplinary fi elds and the need to engage students in productive, collaborative work sessions to generate the synergistic effect of combining many informed individuals' perspectives. Discussions through peer collaboration can be organised to achieve the creation of a knowledge model (KW), i.e. A hypertext structure containing a collection of N-Cmaps with any digital resources about the fi eld under study. Students create their own hypertext and use it as visual resource of information to navigate through the complexity they are learning. After discussing the theoretical foundations that underlie our instructional design, we present a case study involving the collaborative creation of a KM to characterise the interdisciplinary connections among six undergraduate courses offered at the School of Arts, Sciences and Humanities (University of São Paulo, Brazil). Fifty-two students worked collaboratively to map the connections among these courses and the results revealed an interesting perspective. The structured approach adopted to organise the collaborative knowledge construction process allowed students to make explicit several latent information about the courses they were enrolled. The possibility of reducing cognitive overload explains why the combination of N-Cmaps and the hierarchical reductionism method is useful to grasp complexity in classrooms. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2014.

AB  - Despite many efforts from both industry and academia to prepare students for professional practice, the disconnect between what industry would like students to know and the quality and adequacy of the skills with which students graduate still remains. In an attempt to address this disparity, a flipped classroom approach and a strong liaison with an industry partner have been implemented in two consecutive second year Information Systems courses since 2013. A design science methodology, implemented through a theory of coherent practice, was used to guide the design of the curriculum for this approach. As part of the evaluation of this approach, each course was executed as an action experiment. A set of carefully designed interventions to foster an interactive and integrated pedagogy, where students actively participated in their own learning, constituted the elements of these experiments. Interventions, such as quizzes, exercises, discussions, polls, projects and more, were structured to ensure that students experience the three learning stages of knowing, understanding and applying. It was a dynamic and ongoing process of fusing practical experience with theoretical concepts. It further helped to determine what level of competency students have reached and guided their growth to the next level through enhanced skills, experience and deep approaches to learning as well as through changes in attitude. An additional advantage was that students already started to prepare for their careers during the early stages of their studies. The paper will report on the outcomes of the four specific action experiments and the rationale behind their design. Concept maps were used to evaluate the feedback from these experiments, illustrating the benefits and the limitations in each one of the three learning phases. The reflections on and lessons learnt from each action experiment helped to conceptualise new interventions and adapt existing ones. The nature of the involvement of the industry partner will also be highlighted and further improvements will be proposed.

AB  - Every program of instruction taking place in schools, from French to physics, is the result of a complex process called “curriculum development.” It begins with the setting of high level goals and then proceeds through successive stages of elaboration of the concepts, scoping and sequencing content. The design must then be communicated and adopted by the teachers who will implement it. Historically, curriculum reform efforts have not been consistently effective in delivering the desired improvements in student understanding. This chapter discusses how the use of concept mapping could help curriculum developers and teachers at various stages of the process. The ability of maps to focus on key ideas and their connections may help curriculum designs to survive better the translation into classroom experience, and promote collaborative working methods. © Springer-Verlag London 2014.

AB  - This paper presents a study describing the development of an Evaluation Framework (EF) for data competitions in TEL. The study applies the Group Concept Method (GCM) to empirically depict criteria and their indicators for evaluating software applications in TEL. A statistical analysis including multidimensional scaling and hierarchical clustering on the GCM data identified the following six evaluation criteria: 1.Educational Innovation, 2.Usability, 3.Data, 4.Performance, 5.Privacy, and 6.Audience. Each of them was operationalized through a set of indicators. The resulting Evaluation Framework (EF) incorporating these criteria was applied to the first data competition of the LinkedUp project. The EF was consequently improved using the results from reviewers' interviews, which were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. The outcome of these efforts is a comprehensive EF that can be used for TEL data competitions and for the evaluation of TEL tools in general. © 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.

AB  - Environmental, economic, and social trends suggest the need for more sustainable ways of thinking and patterns of behaviour. Such a shift would require humanity to function at high levels of ecological literacy, which relies on a certain amount of scientific literacy. However, troubling evidence indicates an international pattern of student disengagement with science at the secondary level. Evidence also suggests that it is difficult to integrate environmental or sustainability education at this level, both within New Zealand and elsewhere. This research was aimed at examining the use of a novel approach, using permaculture, in junior secondary science (Years 9 and 10) to enhance students’ ecological and scientific literacy, as well as their attitudes toward studying science in school. Permaculture is an ecological design system based on science and ethics. A permaculture approach to science education involves eco-design thinking, as well as the use of local permaculture properties and practitioners, and the science behind common permaculture practices. The approach is also meant to be relevant and engaging, and to promote systems thinking. This study involved the design and delivery of an intervention based on permaculture principles to one Year 10 science class in New Zealand. Research took the form of a naturalistic, interpretive, mixed methods case study, which included the use of questionnaires, interviews, and observations. Data collection focused on the impacts of a permaculture approach on the teaching and learning of science, on students’ ecological literacy, and on students’ attitudes toward learning science in school. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires probed students’ opinions on the environment, science, and learning science in school, and tested their sustainable thinking and systems thinking with concept mapping and SOLO Taxonomy exercises. Classroom observations took place over the course of 12 weeks, on average 3 days per week, totalling 31 days. Before and after some classroom visits, I had informal conversations with the teacher, along with three formal interviews before, during and after the intervention. Three focus groups of students were interviewed immediately following the intervention. Findings show that a permaculture approach to junior secondary science can impact positively on students’ understanding of science and sustainability, and may impact on their attitudes toward studying science in school. It also appeared to impact positively on the science teacher's attitude toward including sustainability in his teaching practice, and on his own sustainability learning. Regarding both students and teachers, a permaculture approach appears to have been effective to cultivate attitudes and trellis learning. The teacher and the students responded favourably to many aspects of the intervention, including the overall focus on the environment, the field trips, and some classroom learning activities. The teacher reported appreciating the way the intervention contextualised science with real world examples. Most students reported appreciating the experiential aspects of the intervention, as well as the relevance that a permaculture approach to science education provided. Findings indicate that advances in ecological and scientific literacy varied among students. Some students appeared to: improve their use of science and sustainability vocabulary; become more aware of select socio-scientific issues; better recognise scientific and ecological limits and possibilities. Some students also showed advances in sustainable thinking and systems thinking. Although many students expressed concern about issues such as pollution, wildlife, and genetic engineering’” and prioritised protecting the environment over making money’” there appeared to be a disconnect between these feelings and a sense of personal responsibility to act. Most students reported enjoying learning science with a focus on the environment, with one cohort indicating much greater enjoyment of the permaculture approach than their usual level of enjoyment of learning science in school. Trends in environmental degradation, population growth, energy inflation, and economic stagnation’” especially pronounced since the beginning of this inquiry in 2008’” indicate that the world of the future will require ecologically literate citizens who can design and create truly sustainable systems for all human endeavors. Cultivating such citizens, and trellising their science and sustainability learning has implications for science education. This thesis identifies an innovative approach for junior secondary science in New Zealand that provides a way towards a more sustainable future. © 2014, The Authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter provides both theoretical underpinnings and practical examples of designing and implementing the "thinking curriculum" for the "global classroom." The authors argue that teaching and learning in the global classroom calls for (1) thinking about the curriculum at a deeper level toward (2) implementing collaborative learning projects that count for multicultural and multilingual online learning environments. They use the term "thinking curriculum" to capture the proposition that teaching and learning are always concept- and assessment-based. The authors discuss examples of two thinking tools, concept mapping and Vee diagramming, to illustrate how these tools can help teachers think and communicate about the whole curricular process in a scientific way. In the second part of the chapter, the authors offer examples of collaborative learning projects that were implemented in the global classroom. In summary, this chapter is a practical guide for teachers who wish to think about their curriculum in a scientific way and recognize the value of creating a global classroom for preparing students for their roles in the global economy. © 2015, IGI Global.

AB  - A VLE is a system where three main actors can be devised: the student in the role of instructional designer, the tutor, and the student. Instructional designers need easy interaction for specifying the course domain structure to the system, and for controlling how well the learning materials agree to such a structure. Tutors need tools for having a holistic perception of the evolution of single students and/or groups in the VLE during the learning process. Finally, students need self regulation in terms of controlling their learning rate, reflect on their learning strategies, and comparing with other people in the class. In this work we claim that sharing an implicit representation of the knowledge about the course domain between all these actors can meet the requirements stated before, and we present a tool that has been developed as part of the I-TUTOR project according to our claim. The tool analyses a suitable document corpus describing the course domain, and generates a semantic space, which in turn is displayed as a 2D zoomable map. All the relevant concepts of the domain are depicted in the map, and learning materials can be browsed through the tool. Also the texts generated by students during the learning process as well as their social activities inside the VLE can be placed in the map. The motivations of the work are reported as well as the underlying AI techniques, and the whole system is explained in detail along with the evaluation performed during the project.

AB  - This article focuses on the development and field testing of instructional design concepts and educational software to teach diagnostic skills necessary to identify and solve problems in complex technical systems. Using concept mapping software along with expert-system programs, the overall software package enables technical workers and students in technology and engineering fields to benefit from personalized, iterative interactions that permit them to design visual maps of a diagnostic strategy and to allow direct and automatic comparison of their visual map to an expert's map. The computer-based modules are developed in the Lectora authoring system and incorporate the VUE concept mapping software. The self-paced, interactive modules include an introduction stage, a visual mapping tutorial stage and a technical system and problem stage. Two technical systems will provide the context for a technical problem, the systems are: 1.) electrical power grid, and 2.) heat exchanger used in a waste plastic pelletizer machine. The educational software can be tailored to include other technical systems and technical problems. This article demonstrates implementation of Similarity Flooding Algorithm (SFA) to solve engineering problems. SFA is used to match nodes and links between learner's and expert's concept maps. To compare two process maps, SFA needs to consider both the relations (links) between nodes and the content of the nodes. In this article, we describe four improvements to the original SFA code to improve the comparison between two different concept (or process) maps: 1) Similarity of two strings is calculated by comparing the two strings character by character, which means that two strings get lower similarity if they are not the same exactly. During the comparison, WordNet® thesaurus is used to accurately evaluate the content of nodes; 2) Base similarity includes absolute similarity for each paired nodes, according to their links and content, but the overall similarity of the maps is calculated based on the relative similarity of each pair; 3) In a process map, the importance of each node could be different and important nodes have more weighting in overall similarity; 4) We consider two threshold values in the comparison algorithm. One is similarity threshold for the similarity based on the connections (links) of the nodes; the other is synonym threshold for the semantic similarity of content. If the similarity is lower than the thresholds, it could be considered as discarded. At the end, we analyze the collected data and show the effectiveness of the proposed technique to solve educational and training problems. Copyright © 2014 by ASME.

AB  - As work is an inherently cooperative phenomenon, it requires a common understanding of the nature of collaboration for all involved parties. In this way, explicit articulation work becomes an integral and essential part of collaboration. Implicit aspects of collaboration have impact on the quality of work results, mainly through social norms and observations of working together. Eliciting those aspects interactively helps in avoiding (mutual) misrepresentations and lack of understanding. Tangible articulation support systems allow aligning mental models of how work should be carried out. Stakeholders can develop a common understanding of collaboration in a semantically open and non-intrusive way. They are not burdened by explication features and diagrammatic notations. We have utilised experiences with model-centred learning theory to support explicit articulation work. According to our field studies, the resulting models can be fed back to current work practices and help in preventing problematic work situations. © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Medical school education has traditionally been driven by single discipline teaching and assessment. Newer medical school curricula often implement an organ-based approach that fosters integration of basic science and clinical disciplines. Concept maps are widely used in education. Through diagrammatic depiction of a variety of concepts and their specific connections with other ideas, concept maps provide a unique perspective into learning and performance that can complement other assessment methods commonly used in medical schools. In this innovation, we describe using concepts maps as a vehicle for a modified a classic Team-Based Learning (TBL) exercise. Modifications to traditional TBL in our innovation included replacing an individual assessment using multiple-choice questions with concept maps as well as combining the group assessment and application exercise whereby teams created concept maps. These modifications were made to further assess understanding of content across the Fundamentals module (the introductory module of the preclerkship curriculum). While preliminary, student performance and feedback from faculty and students support the use of concept maps in TBL. Our findings suggest concept maps can provide a unique means of determining assessment of learning and generating feedback to students. Concept maps can also demonstrate knowledge acquisition, organization of prior and new knowledge, and synthesis of that knowledge across disciplines in a unique way providing an additional means of assessment in addition to traditional multiple-choice questions. © Association of Military Surgeons of the U.S. All rights reserved.

AB  - Question answering (QA) is the automated process of answering general questions submitted by humans in natural language. QA has previously been explored within the educational context to facilitate learning, however the majority of works have focused on text-based answering. As an alternative, this paper proposes an approach to return answers as a concept map, which further encourages meaningful learning and knowledge organisation. Additionally, this paper investigates whether adapting the returned concept map to the specific question context provides further learning benefit. A randomised experiment was conducted with a sample of 59 Computer Science undergraduates, obtaining statistically significant results on learning gain when students are provided with the question-specific concept maps. Further, time spent on studying the concept maps were positively correlated with the learning gain. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.

AB  - The purpose of the research was to establish the impact of the application of a concept map in chemistry lessons on the effective solving of tasks with organic reactions content. In the first phase of the research, a concept map was produced representing the reactions of hydrocarbons, organic halogenated compounds and organic oxygen compounds, and in the second phase the produced concept map was introduced in lessons. Its impact was tested on a sample consisting of 186 students (average age of 17.8 years), who were divided into a control group (88 students) and an experimental group (98 students). Prior to the experiment, the two groups were equalized in terms of their level of development of formal logical thinking and their average grade in chemistry. A knowledge test, consisting of five problem tasks comprising multiple parts, was used as a quantitative instrument for measuring the impact of the applied concept map. The content of the knowledge test was selected on the basis of the chemistry lesson plan (reactions of organic oxygen compounds) for general upper secondary schools (in Slovenian: gimnazija). An analysis of the task solving showed statistically significant differences in the responses of the experimental group members and the control group members (experimental group M = 15.9; SD = 6.33; control group M = 13.6; SD = 7.93; p = 0.03). The produced concept map contributed to the more effective interrelation of concepts and, consequently, to more effective problem task solving.

AB  - In order to enhance primary and secondary education, teaching and learning methods need to be continuously developed as well as, of course, promote teaching quality dependent on teacher personality, teacher professional development, teacher self-development, etc. Teacher professional development gives the novice teacher access to a wide set of teaching methods and assessment opportunities, especially geared to flexible learning and assessment methods, which can be considered for adoption. One such flexible method is the use of concept mapping. This article describes the results of several studies, where concept mapping method was used, giving many didactical suggestions for using concept mapping for learning and especially for assessment. Additionally, considerations are introduced on using concept maps as a research instrument.

AB  - This work contrasts Giovanni Sartor's view of inferential semantics of legal concepts (Sartor in Artif Intell Law 17:217-251, 2009) with a probabilistic model of theory formation (Kemp et al. in Cognition 114:165-196, 2010). The work further explores possibilities of implementing Kemp's probabilistic model of theory formation in the context of mapping legal concepts between two individual legal systems. For implementing the legal concept mapping, we propose a cross-categorization approach that combines three mathematical models: the Bayesian Model of Generalization (BMG; Tenenbaum and Griffiths in Behav Brain Sci 4:629-640, 2001), the probabilistic model of theory formation, i.e., the Infinite Relational Model (IRM) first introduced by Kemp et al. (The twenty-first national conference on artificial intelligence, 2006, Cognition 114:165-196, 2010) and its extended model, i.e., the normal-IRM (n-IRM) proposed by Herlau et al. (IEEE International Workshop on Machine Learning for Signal Processing, 2012). We apply our cross-categorization approach to datasets where legal concepts related to educational systems are respectively defined by the Japanese- and the Danish authorities according to the International Standard Classification of Education. The main contribution of this work is the proposal of a conceptual framework of the cross-categorization approach that, inspired by Sartor (Artif Intell Law 17:217-251, 2009), attempts to explain reasoner's inferential mechanisms. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The paper investigates the effect of technology-supported mind and concept mapping on learning science concepts, student opinions on preparing mind and concept maps, and the practices used. This paper, in which a quasi-experimental design with a pre test-post test control group was used, was carried out on 62 sixth graders during the “Systems in Our Body” unit. In experimental group 1 courses were conducted through technology supported mind mapping activities, while courses in experimental group 2 were conducted through technology supported concept mapping activities. The courses in the control group were conducted through activities in the science and technology curriculum. The results revealed that the students in experimental group 1 had a higher level of understanding concepts than the other groups. Students in experimental group 1 stated that it was fun and instructive to prepare mind maps; students in experimental group 2 stated that the concept maps were fun and instructive. © Kamla-Raj 2015.

AB  - Environmental education in the 21st century requires well-instructed teachers with teaching and communication abilities. This paper presents an educational experience developed in several biology and environmental teacher training courses and focused on the treatment of environmental education as a transversal educational topic. For that aim, text analysis techniques, concept mapping and informatics tools have been used to represent individual and collaborative knowledge about environmental topics. 69 students participated in the research. Data about the educational activities developed by the participants have been collected. Furthermore, students have expressed their opinions on the formative process by means of an opinion survey. The outcomes of this study reveal that future teachers and environmental educators consider that concept mapping is a valuable tool to represent their knowledge about environmental education, to encourage reflexive and collaborative learning, to improve teaching communicative abilities and to use effectively ICT in the classroom.

AB  - Concept mapping was developed as a method of displaying and organizing hierarchical knowledge structures. Using the new, multidimensional presentation software Prezi, we have developed a new teaching technique designed to engage higher-level skills in the cognitive domain. This tool, synthesis mapping, is a natural evolution of concept mapping, which utilizes embedding to layer information within concepts. Prezi’s zooming user interface lets the author of the presentation use both depth as well as distance to show connections between data, ideas, and concepts. Students in the class Biology of Cancer created synthesis maps to illustrate their knowledge of tumorigenesis. Students used multiple organizational schemes to build their maps. We present an analysis of student work, placing special emphasis on organization within student maps and how the organization of knowledge structures in student maps can reveal strengths and weaknesses in student understanding or instruction. We also provide a discussion of best practices for instructors who would like to implement synthesis mapping in their classrooms. © 2015 R. A. Ortega and C. J. Brame et al.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate experienced science teachers’ perceptions regard integrating literacy and technology while teaching science at an elementary level. A concept map and rubric were developed based on the TPACK model to assess teachers' understanding and an in-depth interview technique was used to collect more data from the teachers. For the analysis, the concept map was graded based on the rubric and in-depth interviews were thematically analyzed. The data indicated that teachers have a negative perception about integrating technology and literacy in their classes, due to several barriers. This paper concludes with recommendations to facilitate the use of technology and literacy when teaching science in the elementary schools in Kuwait. © 2015, Canadian Center of Science and Education.

AB  - Biological data analysis is frequently performed with command line software. While this practice provides considerable flexibility for computationally savy individuals, such as investigators trained in bioinformatics, this also creates a barrier to the widespread use of data analysis software by investigators trained as biologists and/or clinicians. Workflow systems such as Galaxy and Taverna have been developed to try and provide generic user interfaces that can wrap command line analysis software. These solutions are useful for problems that can be solved with workflows, and that do not require specialized user interfaces. However, some types of analyses can benefit fromcustomuser interfaces. For instance, developing biomarker models from high-throughput data is a type of analysis that can be expressed more succinctly with specialized user interfaces. Here, we show how Language Workbench (LW) technology can be used to model the biomarker development and validation process. We developed a language that models the concepts of Dataset, Endpoint, Feature Selection Method and Classifier. These high-level language concepts map directly to abstractions that analysts who develop biomarker models are familiar with. We found that user interfaces developed in the Meta-Programming System (MPS) LW provide convenient means to configure a biomarker development project, to train models and view the validation statistics. We discuss several advantages of developing user interfaces for data analysis with a LW, including increased interface consistency, portability and extension by language composition. The language developed during this experiment is distributed as an MPS plugin. © 2015 Benson and Campagne.

AB  - As students create shared artifacts, individuals and the social system co-evolve through dynamic processes in which individuals and groups shape each other. After collaboration, however, it is not always clear what students internalize from this interaction. Even when students are aware of group-work benefits, effective collaboration does not necessarily occur spontaneously within the group context. To address this potential issue, the teacher can facilitate collaboration by modeling how to foster elaborative group discussions. In this paper, we evaluate how teacher modeling of collaboration prompts may increase the quantity and quality of concepts that students internalize before, during, and after collaboration. We found that students who did not observe modeling increased the quantity of connection on their post concept maps. In contrast, students who did receive modeling increased both the quantity and quality of their connections. This suggests that modeling of prompts before collaboration can deepen the internalization of concepts. © ISLS

AB  - Conceptual acquisition is an important aspect of science education, especially with regard to committing things to long term memory. Three case studies were carried out to examine approaches to conceptual acquisition in science education. The aim of these studies was to determine whether concept mapping method is a valid research method. To answer the question, studies were developed. Two of them used animation to describe abstract topics in chemistry. The aim of the third study was to compare the diferences in higher taxonomy concept maps, created in an allocated timeframe. The fndings of the studies indicate that the use of voiced interactive animation without teacher explanation does not lend itself to superior concept acquisition. As a result of the study it was concluded that concept mapping as an assessment method provides a unique possibility to visualize the structure of students’ conceptual achievements. Based on the outcomes it is recommended concept mapping should be used more as an assessment or research method. © 2014(Publisher Name). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Traditional instructional materials such as textbooks contain significant educational content, but thenavigational mechanisms to access that content are limited and, more importantly, not designed with learning in mind. To address this gap, we present the Adaptive Map, a novel organization and navigation tool designed to help students better understand large collections of information such as those found in textbooks. The tool promotes conceptual understanding by leveraging expert-generated concept maps, which have been shown to improve learning. In addition, to alleviate problems associated with visually processing large-scale concept maps, our design integrated information visualization techniques to increase usability and facilitate processing. To evaluate the approach, a prototype was developed and tested in an engineering statics class. A multiple case study methodology was used to explore how students used the tool. Results show that the tool promoted conceptual understanding by facilitating advance organizer usage and students' exploration of relevant prior content.

AB  - Helping students learn the basic sciences and demonstrating their importance in the practice of medicine presents a challenge for the majority of medical science educators. A curriculum change of medical biochemistry was implemented to include concept mapping as a visual strategy to enhance the analytical and critical thinking skills during clinical case-based workshops. A rubric was used to give detailed feedback and provide guidance to students. A number of clinical cases were judiciously selected to illustrate specific topics. Students meet with a faculty member to discuss the concept map prior to the workshop. During such meetings, all members are asked to participate in explaining their reasoning and decisionmaking and to thereby justify the flow of the concept map. This activity gives students the opportunity to demonstrate their capacity to visualize their knowledge using the concept map construction. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - This work presents the design, development, testing and validation of a Photonic Virtual Laboratory, highlighting the study of LEDs. The study was conducted from a conceptual, experimental and didactic standpoint, using e-learning and m-learning platforms. Specifically, teaching tools that help ensure that our students perform significant learning have been developed. It has been brought together the scientific aspect, such as the study of LEDs, with techniques of generation and transfer of knowledge through the selection, hierarchization and structuring of information using concept maps. For the validation of the didactic materials developed, it has been used procedures with various assessment tools for the collection and processing of data, applied in the context of an experimental design. Additionally, it was performed a statistical analysis to determine the validity of the materials developed. The assessment has been designed to validate the contributions of the new materials developed over the traditional method of teaching, and to quantify the learning achieved by students, in order to draw conclusions that serve as a reference for its application in the teaching and learning processes, and comprehensively validate the work carried out. © 2014 SPIE, OSA, IEEE, ICO.

AB  - This case study explored the development of two pre-service teachers’ subject matter knowledge (SMK) of electromagnetism while integrating the use of concept maps (CM) and collaborative learning (CL) strategies. The study aimed at capturing how these pre-service teachers’ SMK in electromagnetism was enhanced after having been taught SMK in a university module on electromagnetism via a lecture mode. The participants’ progress in acquiring SMK was monitored when they engaged in individualconstructivist learning and socio-constructivist learning when working in pairs. Data were collected from concept maps on electromagnetism and from individual interviews. This interpretive case study suggests that the participants benefitted in several ways in consolidating their SMK of electromagnetism through integrating CM activities and engaging in CL. These benefits included the revision of previous work; the reflection on choices of the big conceptual ideas in electromagnetism; making appropriate conceptual connections supported by experiments; using new terminology in conceptual linkages; sharing ideas via arguing and explaining to each other; and consolidating learning by drawing and extending concept maps over time. The study suggests that the pre-service teachers did benefit from both the individual constructivist and socio-constructivist approaches in consolidating their SMK through the integrated CL and CM activities. © 2015 Southern African Association for Research in Mathematics, Science and Technology.

AB  - Concept maps have been used to help students with learning disabilities (LD) improve literacy skills and content learning, predominantly in secondary school. However, despite increased access to classroom technology, no previous studies have examined the efficacy of computer-based concept maps to improve learning from informational text for students with LD in elementary school. In this study, we used a concurrent delayed multiple probe design to evaluate the interactive use of computer-based concept maps on content acquisition with science and social studies texts for Hispanic students with LD in Grades 4 and 5. Findings from this study suggest that students improved content knowledge during intervention relative to a traditional instruction baseline condition. Learning outcomes and social validity information are considered to inform recommendations for future research and the feasibility of classroom implementation. © The Author(s) 2014.

AB  - In Hong Kong the majority of youth have not many opportunities to receive appropriate support about sexuality. To fill this gap a total of 15 units (five for each year) on sex education are included in the extension phase of Project P.A.T.H.S. Sex education is intended as a moment of personal growth in which pupils have the chance to reflect on gender differences, love, relationships, dating, diversity, and all areas related to sexuality (rather than just sexual intercourse or the biology of the body). This chapter illustrates the guiding principles for the construction of the conceptual framework, structure of the course, operationalization of the 11 PYD constructs in the sex education curriculum, and implementation of the protective factors in the teaching units. Concept maps of the curriculum for each school year are also presented. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.

AB  - Sustainability is fast becoming a, if not the, central research issue of our time. The inexorable press of climate change, population growth and resource consumption highlights the need to produce knowledge that enables us to act with our future in mind. Transdisciplinary sustainability science (TDSS) has emerged in response to this need. TDSS is driven by complex sustainability problems, such as siting of waste facilities or formulation of climate adaptation policies, that require input from many disciplines, professions and communities (Spangenberg 2011), thereby motivating the democratization of science and new forms of engagement (Carolan 2006). Many of the problems TDSS addresses resist precise formulation, are irreducibly normative, and are better understood as treated rather than solved (Miller 2013; Spangenberg 2011). TDSS problems operate at multiple scales, involving social and ecological elements across space and time, and exhibit non-linear behaviour (Miller 2013). Because these problems cut across multiple sectors, including science, policy, technology and business, often in unprecedented ways, formulaic responses must give way to highly contextual responses that make use of heuristic strategies targeted at overcoming specific types of challenges. Responses to TDSS problems take many forms, from large-scale initiatives to smaller-scale projects focusing on specific problems that lend themselves to treatment by teams of collaborators. These smaller projects often focus on research, development, or both in a particular location. In this chapter, we focus our attention on the project level. Not surprisingly, complex TDSS projects confront many challenges, from uncertainty on the side of society to methodological incommensurability on the side of science (Lang et al. 2012). Principal among these challenges are those that turn on communication, understood as involving both social relationships and information. Successful communication by collaborators in TDSS projects builds the common ground and mutual understanding necessary to support effective responses to TDSS problems. Fortunately, there are ways to respond to communication challenges when they arise. Responses range from tools (e.g. concept mapping) that can be used to address specific challenges, to broader approaches (e.g. deliberative strategies) that can facilitate communication at all stages of the project. We consider these tools and approaches heuristics, in that they supply details about how to respond to novel situations and as such are sensitive to the unique nature of each challenge, exhibiting the kind of ‘ecological rationality’ that Huutoniemi (Chapter 1, this volume) argues is the hallmark of heuristics. While others have addressed the broad range of challenges confronting TDSS (e.g. Lynam et al. 2007; Lang et al. 2012), our focus is more limited. Concentrating on communication in the context of TDSS decision-making at the project level, we review several best practices that use communication heuristics, illustrating them with recent examples from the literature. After first providing a characterization of communication, we briefly survey communication challenges that can undermine decisions aimed at advancing TDSS project goals. These challenges motivate attention to responses. Drawing from the social psychology of small groups and sociocultural theory of learning, we describe several tested, heuristic responses to communication challenges that arise at each stage of a TDSS project within diverse decisionmaking groups. In describing these responses, we illustrate our points with recent examples from TDSS research and emphasize mechanisms that have yet to receive sustained attention in the TDSS literature. © 2014 selection and editorial material, Katri Huutoniemi and Petri Tapio; individual chapters, the contributors.

AB  - Students' understanding of scientific conceptual knowledge is often represented as an interlinked web of concepts, principles, laws and models. A long-standing problem in educational research is identifying the key concepts that are central in producing cohesion and contingency in such a web. Here we use network analysis to examine students' representations of the relatedness of physics concepts in the form of concept maps, and suggest how key concepts can be identified. The concept maps are analysed as weighted networks, where nodes are concepts or other conceptual elements and links represent different types of epistemically justified connections between concepts. The importance of concepts in providing cohesion is operationalized through subgraph centrality SC, while their importance in providing contingency is operationalized through communicability betweenness centrality BC. Key concepts are identified through importance ranking IR, which is the geometric mean of SC and BC, suitably normalized. We show that IR is able to reliably identify a set of nodes that are the most important in all networks. In order to effect a more detailed comparison of different concept networks, a similarity measure is developed, which pays attention to subtle but important differences in the importance rankings of concepts in different concept networks. © The authors 2014.

AB  - Concept Maps are graphic representations of topics, ideas, and their relationships. They allow users to group information in related modules so that the connections between the modules become more readily apparent. Among the potential uses of concept mapping for the improvement of learning and teaching in classrooms, the powerful technique of concept mapping could improve education in four different categories: (1) as a planned learning strategy, (2) as an instructional strategy, (3) as a strategy for planning curriculum, and (4) as a means of assessing students understanding of science concepts. Concept Maps are essential to increase meaningful learning in students and for representing the knowledge, experience of individuals and teams in education, science, medical and management course. In this paper we have made exhaustive survey to bind up various research works carried on concept maps in the above mentioned disciplines and have simplified the things for beginners to carry out research on concept mapping. © 2015 The Authors.

AB  - This study investigated the conceptions of 340 Taiwanese high school students (grades 10 to 12) regarding oxidation–reduction reactions. The diagnostic tool used was a two-tier test based on a concept map of redox reactions as presented in high school curriculums. The reliability of the two-tier test items was 0.82. The results show that most 11th graders performed equally well in questions related to the concept of the gain and loss of electrons during oxidation–reduction. In terms of working with oxidation numbers, scores increased with grade level. The results of this study provide valuable reference for curriculum designers and science instructors. © 2014(Publisher Name). All Rights Reserved.

AB  - The combination of the process of pedagogical planning within the Blended (b-)learning environment with the users' quality of interaction (QoI) with the Learning Management System (LMS), serving as an effective feedback, is explored here. The required QoI (both for teachers and students) is estimated by adopting a fuzzy logic-based modeling approach, namely FuzzyQoI, applied to LMS Moodle data from two academic teaching of dance disciplines, including rare and contemporary dances, respectively. The latter are used as paradigms that comply with the educational scenarios of the i-Treasures project (www.i-treasures.eu), which refers to the intangible cultural heritage. Based on documental analysis, the pedagogical design strategies per semester were transcribed to concept maps and the dynamically (per week) estimated QoIs were presented as feedback to the teachers at the end of the first semester, so they could reflect and update their pedagogical planning, anticipating more enhanced QoI at the second one. The results presented here show the beneficial role of QoI to shift the educational scenarios and strategies towards a more dynamic design, yet taking into consideration the inherent tendencies and attitudes of the users' interaction within the blearning context.

AB  - This chapter reports on the results of a four-year longitudinal study of PhD students and their supervisors, from which the evidence gained suggests that the students tend to focus on the PhD in terms of a product to be completed (in terms of writing a thesis and peer-reviewed journals), whilst the supervisors tend to concentrate more on the process of learning and scientific development, placing the student's contribution into the wider disciplinary discourse. The structural observations from the concept maps generated within this research are that the students perceive the PhD as a linear structure, whereas the supervisors are more likely to generate a cyclic structure to illustrate the dynamic, iterative processes of research more generally. Further structural elements emerge from the analysis of the maps, indicating the need for holistic understanding of the content, structure, and meanings in concept maps and their relationship with safe spaces for the development of critical thinking. © 2014, IGI Global.

AB  - Many studies carried out on the mole concept emphasize that students show significant difficulties in learning this concept. The aim of our research was to analyze those difficulties that students, who have their first contact with chemistry in school, encounter, and also to examine the usefulness of systemics as a graphical way of knowledge representation. The sample of the study included seventh grade students from a primary school in Novi Sad, Serbia. Based on the results of the pre-test, students were divided into three main groups: “excellent”, “good” and “acceptable”, which all consisted of two subgroups: experimental and control. Students in the experimental subgroup were learning by applying systemics, while the students in the control subgroup were taught by traditional method. The final results show that systemics is convenient in overcoming the difficulties in the case of “excellent” and “acceptable” groups of students, while the same cannot be concluded for the students characterized as “good”. Systemics has not proved to be adequate for them. The following question remains a topic for the future research: Is there any way that the group of students characterized as “good” still benefits from learning with systemics? In addition, new research on a larger number of students should be conducted, in order to statistically confirm these results, or to discuss new ones. © 2014, Facteachereducation.

AB  - We attack the problem of learning concepts automatically from noisy Web image search results. The idea is based on discovering common characteristics shared among subsets of images by posing a method that is able to organise the data while eliminating irrelevant instances. We propose a novel clustering and outlier detection method, namely Concept Map (CMAP). Given an image collection returned for a concept query, CMAP provides clusters pruned from outliers. Each cluster is used to train a model representing a different characteristics of the concept. The proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art studies on the task of learning from noisy web data for low-level attributes, as well as high level object categories. It is also competitive with the supervised methods in learning scene concepts. Moreover, results on naming faces support the generalisation capability of the CMAP framework to different domains. CMAP is capable to work at large scale with no supervision through exploiting the available sources. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - Many recent studies have reported the benefits of educational computer games in promoting students' learning motivations. On the other hand, however, the effect of digital game-based learning in improving students' learning performance has been questioned. Several previous studies have reported that without properly integrating learning strategies into gaming scenarios, the effectiveness of educational computer games could be limited, or may be even worse than that of the conventional technology-enhanced learning approach. In this study, a concept map-embedded gaming approach is proposed for developing educational computer games by integrating concept mapping as part of the gaming scenarios to help students organize what they have learned during the game-based learning process. Moreover, a role-playing game has been developed for an elementary school natural science course based on the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the concept map-embedded gaming approach can significantly improve the students' learning achievement and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students who learned with the proposed approach revealed a significantly higher degree of perceived usefulness than those who learned with the conventional game-based learning approach. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The present study investigates effective approaches to facilitate college students' self-regulated learning. Moodle forums were employed as a platform for students to develop metacognitive skills in the learning of psychology, and digital concept mapping was used to measure their conceptual knowledge. The findings suggest that discussions on Moodle forums enhanced students' awareness of their learning processes and facilitated the development of metacognitive skills. Active participation in such discussions promoted knowledge construction in concept mapping. © ISLS.

AB  - In physics teacher education, one of the recurrent themes is the importance of fostering the formation of organised and coherent knowledge structures, but a simple shared understanding of what coherence actually means and how it can be recognised, is not easily found. This study suggests an approach in which the coherence of students' views about the relatedness of physics concepts can be identified and evaluated. Six pre-service physics teachers presented their understanding of the relatedness of physics concepts in the form of specially designed concept maps in which experimental or modelling procedures were required as links between physics concepts. The acceptability of the links was evaluated by using four criteria for epistemic analysis introduced in this study. The weighted values describing the maps' structural features were calculated, and finally, the cases were compared and the differences between them were discussed. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge and thus also the coherence of such knowledge. The highest criterion set for acceptability seems to be very demanding to fulfil and even in the advanced level of studies only a fraction of students manage to reach it. The cases examined here show that the knowledge structures are partly fragmented and not as coherent as one would have expected them to be. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Background: Medical student education is challenging, and concept maps (CMs) can help students link new and existing knowledge, promote critical thinking and identify knowledge gaps. Aims: To study the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of CMs in problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials. Method: Students and tutors were randomized to tutorials that used or did not use CMs. A mixed-methods approach generated qualitative and quantitative results of participants' perspectives on and the effects of CMs in PBL tutorials. Results: Student survey response rate was 71% (122/172). Most students (82.6%) planned to use CMs in the future at least occasionally, and students in CM tutorials endorsed increased likelihood of using CMs in the future (p=0.02) versus students in non-CM tutorials. Qualitative analyses identified consistent associations between CMs and recurrent themes: integration of physiological mechanisms, challenging students' knowledge of the material, and identification of knowledge gaps. Quantitative assessment of final exam scores revealed a statistically significant increase in the students' scores in CM tutorials versus students in non-CM tutorials with an a priori of <0.10. Conclusions: CMs are well accepted by students and faculty, feasible to incorporate into PBL tutorials, and may result in improved exam performance and student learning of physiologic concepts. © 2013 Informa UK Ltd All rights reserved: reproduction in whole or part not permitted.

AB  - Project based learning (PjBL) can be an effective approach to developing graduate attributes, but it depends on how it is implemented. Chemical Engineering of RMIT University has a stream of PjBL subjects from first to final year. The projects are incrementally more complex but have the same goal: to choose a best process design, using management decision making tools to justify their choices. The tools include GEMI Metrics Navigator™. This paper reports an evaluation of whether students' understanding of sustainability is enhanced by undertaking multiple projects, as well as use of sophisticated analysis tools. Student learning outcomes from intermediate and final subjects were compared using ConceptMaps and a focus group. The students' understanding of sustainability increased substantially from 2nd to final year, similar to results reported in European studies. The spread of results was broad, attributed to range of student ability and differences between student cohorts. Development of understanding of sustainability was attributed to undertaking multiple projects and use of spread-sheeting tools. Use of the GEMI tool was identified as facilitating application of sustainability principles to process design decisions. Concept maps are a useful way to evaluate innovations in teaching sustainable engineering. © 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

AB  - Researchers at the University of Colorado Denver (U(D) are focusing on computer design. constructi\e learning theory and cognitive linguistics to develop and test a cloud computing learning system to increase achievement among students in the STEM disciplines. This paper describes Efficient Learning Maps (eLms), an education technology designed to enhance logical thinking through the construction of concept maps using seven basic graphic symbols that represent logical operations. After and presenting evidence that the technology may prove cffectic and a strong need exists for effective education technologies the paper asks the question as to why the Visual Logic Maps technology appears work as intended when recent reports indicate that the efficacy of education technologies have resulted in negative or negligible results. The researchers of this paper suggest that the reason for the effectiveness of one technology versus others can be explained by I) the design of the software which uses enhancement of mapping skills to enhance reading comprehension and vice versa: and 2) the findings of social scientists and media studies experts associated with Marshall MeLuhan and the hypothesis of left and right brain diffcrcnce. The paper concludes with the obser',ation that before educators and software engineers can deselop computer applications to advance knowledge and improve learning, they must first ask the basic question as to what constitutes knos ledge in the twenty-first century lien new technotogies may be changing our very understanding of knos ledge iiself.

AB  - Students hold a rich repertoire of alternative ideas of evolution that are often quite resistant to change. One cause could be a disconnection between genotype and phenotype level ideas. Making these connections explicit might help students build a more coherent understanding of evolution. This study investigates how a novel form of collaborative technology-enhanced concept map, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), can support students' learning from an inquiry-based, technology-enhanced evolution curriculum. Findings indicate that KIM activities can facilitate the generation of cross-connections between genotype and phenotype ideas and support students distinguishing central ideas. Results suggest that students' used fewer non-normative teleological ideas. Furthermore, results suggest that critiquing KIMs might be a more time-efficient alternative to generating KIMs from scratch. Findings from this study are valuable for the design of efficient learning environments to support more integrated understanding of complex scientific ideas. © ISLS.

AB  - The paper details an exploratory qualitative study that investigated 61 prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving salt and sugar in water respectively. The study was set within a 15-week elementary science methods course that included a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the instructional context. Oversby's (Prim Sci Rev 63:6-19, 2002, Aspects of teaching secondary science, Routledge Falmer, London, 2002) ladder of explanations for the context of dissolving, current scientific explanations for dissolving and perspectives on conceptions and misconceptions provided the unified framework for the study. Concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, and drawings and narratives were used as data to investigate these prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving throughout the 15-weeks of the methods course. Analysis revealed that participants' explanations of dissolving were predominantly descriptive explanations (39 %) and interpretative explanations (38 %), with lower percentage occurrences of intentional (14 %) and cause and effect (9 %) level explanations. Most of these explanations were also constructed by a set of loosely connected and reinforcing everyday concepts abstracted from common everyday experiences making them misconceptions. Implications include: (1) the need for science teacher educators to use multiple platforms to derive their prospective elementary teachers' conceptual understandings of science content; and (2) to identify and help them identify their own scientific conceptions and misconceptions and how they influence the construction of scientific/nonscientific explanations. Science teacher educators also need to emphasize the role of meaningful frameworks associated with the concept that is being introduced during the Engage phase of the 5E learning cycle. This is important because, relevant prior knowledge is associated with the knowledge of the particle theory of matter and both are part of larger knowledge system comprised of interrelated scientific concepts. © 2013 The Association for Science Teacher Education, USA.

AB  - The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of models of programmed instruction and conventional (informative-illustrative) expository teaching in terms of fulfilling the aims of the course 'Human anatomy and physiology' which is included in the physiology programme and designed for undergraduate students majoring in biology education at the Faculty of Biology, University of Belgrade. For this purpose, a model of a pedagogical experiment with parallel groups of students was applied. One group was presented the course content through programmed instruction, with the help of computers and programmed materials, which included the elaboration of concept maps. The second group was presented the same content through expository (informative- illustrative) instruction, the traditional lecturing model. In terms of quantity and quality of knowledge acquired by students in the tested teaching field, the experimental model of programmed instruction was more effective. © 2013 Society of Biology.

AB  - We study the misconceptions about colour that most people hold, determining the general phenomenological laws that govern them. Concept mapping was used to combat the misconceptions which were found in the application of a test specifically designed to determine these misconceptions, while avoiding the possible misleading inductions that could have arisen from the use of everyday language. In particular, care was taken to avoid the distorting effect that the use of the verb 'to be' applied to coloured objects could have on the responses. The misconceptions found were shown to have an internal consistency in the form of authentic mini-theories (implicit theories). We compared experimentally the results of two different teaching methods applied to combat these misconceptions. This study was conducted with 470 undergraduates of the University of Extremadura. We analysed the persistence over time of their learning made to overcome those misconceptions. The students were divided randomly into an experimental group (EG) and a control group (CG). To combat their misconceptions, EG were taught following a method based on the use of concept maps, and CG were taught following traditional teaching methods. The results of a pre-test and a post-test were compared for the two groups, finding statistically significant differences. The results allowed the principal working hypothesis to be accepted-concept maps are learning tools which foster conceptual change and allow misconceptions to be eradicated via meaningful learning maintained over time, i.e. EG acquired a relative long-lasting gain in learning that was superior to that acquired by CG. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E. G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C. G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E. G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C. G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E. G. students as compared with the C. G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E. G. students' learning was greater than 19 percentage points. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This study sought to identify ethnically diverse students' study strategies in organic chemistry and their relationships to course outcomes. Study diaries, concept maps, and problem sets were used to assess study outcomes. Findings show that students engage in four commonly used reviewing-type strategies, regardless of ethnic group affiliation. However, these common strategies were rarely associated with students' problem solving, concept mapping, or course performance. In addition, students seldom engaged in metacognitive and peer learning strategies despite their reported benefits in the literature. Implications for research and practice are discussed in light of these findings. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Physical education and health education are relevant avenues for adolescents to learn knowledge and behavior related to energy-balanced living. Grounded in the framework theory of conceptual change, this study examined ninth graders' energy balance knowledge (i.e., concepts, principles, and strategies underlying the scientific mechanism and the outcome of energy balanced/imbalanced living) and physical activity in a healthful-living curriculum (i.e. combination of physical education and health). The students (N= 195) were measured using concept mapping, accelerometers, and three-day physical activity recall. It was found that the students differed in energy balance knowledge where most (83%) lacked a higher-order relational understanding. Physical activity in physical education class or after school did not significantly differ by students' mental model levels concerning energy balance knowledge. The findings suggest that an ecological learning context with moderate physical activity should be provided to help students make sense of energy balance knowledge through lived experiences. © 2013.

AB  - Climate change is a complex environmental problem that can be used to examine students' understanding, gained through classroom communication, of climate change and its interactions. The present study examines a series of four science sessions given to a group of primary school student teachers (n = 20). This includes analysis of the communication styles used and the students' pre- and post-conceptualisation of climate change based on results obtained via essay writing and drawings. The essays and drawings concerned the students' unprompted pre- and post-conceptions about climate change, collected before and after each of the four inquiry-based science sessions (in physics, chemistry, biology and geography). Concept mapping was used in the analysis of the students' responses. The communication used in the four sessions was analysed with a communicative approach in order to find out the discussion about climate change between teacher and students. The analyses indicated that the students did not have the knowledge or the courage to participate in discussion, but post-conceptualisation map showed that students' thinking had become more coherent after the four sessions. Given the results of the present study, proposals for using concepts maps and/or communication analysis in studying students' conceptions are presented. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Constructivist learning theory is used to examine students' individual understandings from a collaborative science-writing project on alternative energies supported by Web 2.0 technologies. We examine how high school chemistry students (n=30) make sense of alternative energy constructs through analyzing changes in pre- and post-intervention concept maps. Through statistical and structural analysis of their concept maps, we investigate changes in the students' understandings about alternative energy. Our findings suggest that students increased their knowledge about alternative energies at different levels, reflecting both surface and deep learning of related environmental education concepts, as well as creating strong connections between concepts related to safety, costs, and health for different types of alternative energy. In addition, student elaboration increased for all energy types, suggesting that the jigsaw pedagogy was successful in improving individual understandings. © ISLS.

AB  - The iCollaborate Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) project is a multiyear, multifaceted research project designed to understand how student learning outcomes, student engagement, and successful course completion rates in introductory MSE courses are affected by a variety of programs and activities that are based upon best practices from STEM education research. A number of interventions and active techniques were used in the classroom, at first, singularly and, as the project progressed, in various combinations. Additionally, a wide variety of faculty and student resources were created as part of this project. For example, test device MSE iPod applications were developed for iCollaborate: Concept Questions, Vocabulary, Basic Knowledge, Tune-Up, Material Properties, Composite Calculator, MSE Convert, and MSE Knowledge Tools and Review. Furthermore, a concept map based web site, which includes web applications of key iPod applications is currently under construction. Initially, the purpose of the website was envisioned as a repository of project resources, but as our research proceeded, it became obvious that the students perceived the concept map and web tools as essential parts of the project and their view of their personal success strategies. Overall, the basic principles implemented in the project are supported by theory based in cognitive and social constructivism and the substantial body of evidence that favors collaborative learning and the inductive approach over the traditional lecture driven, deductive teaching approach. Collaborative learning, active/inquiry learning, concept learning, peer learning, problem/case-based learning, low stakes quizzing, mini-lectures with just-in-time reading, collaborate research writing, and constructive alignment are all part of the project. The newly developed iCollaborate learning exercises are conceptually targeted, designed to provide scaffolds to prior knowledge, and are active, inquiry based modules. Not surprisingly, we found that students come to the course with different levels of preparation and that scores in prerequisite courses do matter, but these are not always perfect indicators that key information from those courses was retained. Students enter the course with a wide range of learning styles, and some prerequisite information is retained or learned differently based on individual learning styles (as measured by our assessments). Based on our findings, we recommend that every instructor evaluate the prerequisite knowledge of their students and complete targeted interventions aimed at known robust MSE misconceptions and local knowledge gaps. Overall, the students were able to understand the relationships between the collaborative assignments, the low stakes quizzes, and the mini-lectures in helping them learn different types of concepts. This paper concentrates on previously unreported components of the iCollaborate project that were investigated, evaluated, or developed during the 2012-2013 academic year. The development of the iCollaborate concept map and web applications web site is emphasized in this paper. The paper concludes with a summary of findings thus far from the project and a discussion of future directions and research opportunities. The plans for the final year of the project will be discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.

AB  - The aim of this study is to test collaborative concept mapping activities using computers in a classroom scenario and to evaluate the possibilities that Elkar-CM offers for collaboratively learning non-technical topics. Elkar-CM is a multi-lingual and multi-media software program designed for drawing concept maps (CMs) collaboratively. Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure. This study was carried out with Social Education degree students at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU). The experiment included two learning activities. First, all students collaboratively constructed in the classroom a CM on the subject of Moral Development. Second, students were organised into groups to complete the CM generated in the first part. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The ability to monitor the status of one's own understanding is important to accomplish academic tasks proficiently. Previous studies have shown that comprehension monitoring (metacomprehension accuracy) is generally poor, but improves when readers engage in activities that access valid cues reflecting their situation model (activities such as concept mapping or self-explaining). However, the question still remains as to which process, encoding or retrieving, causes the improvement of metacomprehension accuracy, and the findings of previous research on this matter have been inconsistent. This study examined whether college students' metacomprehension accuracy improves when they expect, at the time of reading, that they will explain the content later (active encoding) or when they actually generate an explanation (encoding plus active retrieving). In the experiments, college students read five texts. During reading, some students expected that they would generate explanations but did not actually generate them. In contrast, some students actually generated an explanation of the text after reading. All students then rated their comprehension of each text. Finally, they completed tests on the materials. Results of both studies revealed that metacomprehension accuracy, operationalized as the association between comprehension ratings and test performance, was greater for the group that actually generated explanations than for the expectancy or control groups. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - There is evidence that Pen-based Technologies (PBTs) can facilitate radical changes that would make it possible to address problems typically associated with lecture-based pedagogical models. In the context of universitylevel Computer Science studies, there is widespread consensus that PBTs-and tablet PCs, in particular-are tools that have great potential for encouraging interaction in the classroom and promoting a far more dynamic learning environment. In view off the complexity of these types of technology and their explosive evolution, it would be advisable to assist teachers who wish to utilize them by developing strategies based on a conceptualization of their educational capabilities. With this objective in mind, this article analyzes the use of concept maps as tools for modeling both the instructional domain and the PBTs domain. To validate the proposed approach, a number of workshops were conducted, in which professors of Engineering were given a presentation on the educational capabilities of these technologies and then had the opportunity to experiment with tablet PCs and other digital ink devices. Participants completed a prequestionnaire at the start of the workshop; its questions were generated from a generic concept map for the instructional domain, and its purpose was to list each professor's instructional requirements. Next, recommendations for use were developed, based on the PBTs concept map, and converted to the questions on a post-questionnaire completed at the end of the workshop, on which the teachers indicated the degree to which they agreed with the recommendations. More than 70 professors from different departments participated in these workshops, and their overall evaluation was quite favorable.&copy;Common Ground, José-Vicente Benlloch-Dualde, Félix Buendía-García, Juan-Carlos Cano, Sara Blanc, Lenin-Guillermo Lemus-Zúñiga.

AB  - Some task analysis methods break down a task into a hierarchy of subgoals. Although an important tool of many fields of study, learning to create such a hierarchy (redescription) is not trivial. To further the understanding of what makes task analysis a skill, the present research examined novices' problems with learning Hierarchical Task Analysis and captured practitioners' performance. All participants received a task description and analyzed three cooking and three communication tasks by drawing on their knowledge of those tasks. Thirty six younger adults (18-28 years) in Study 1 analyzed one task before training and five afterwards. Training consisted of a general handout that all participants received and an additional handout that differed between three conditions: a list of steps, a flow-diagram, and concept map. In Study 2, eight experienced task analysts received the same task descriptions as in Study 1 and demonstrated their understanding of task analysis while thinking aloud. Novices' initial task analysis scored low on all coding criteria. Performance improved on some criteria but was well below 100 % on others. Practitioners' task analyses were 2-3 levels deep but also scored low on some criteria. A task analyst's purpose of analysis may be the reason for higher specificity of analysis. This research furthers the understanding of Hierarchical Task Analysis and provides insights into the varying nature of task analyses as a function of experience. The derived skill components can inform training objectives. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Students may acquire mislearnings in the course of their academic lives for various reasons and keep them for a lifetime. Some of the most common of those mislearnings are the alternative conceptions university students have about Biology lesson. This study was conducted through one-to-one interviews with 54 students at the 1st grade of the Department of Classroom Teaching in order to determine university students' alternative learnings about the classification and the diversity of plants and remove these alternative learnings if there were any. In the end, it was found that students had mislearnings about the classification and the diversity of plants. The main mislearning was that students classify some of the plants they knew well in a wrong way according to the criteria which was not biological; for example, they thought fern and bryophyte were plants with seeds, fungi were plants, and the plants belonging to the family of Pinaceae did not have real leaves so they were included in the class of plants without seeds. In order to remove these mislearnings 'Porphyrios Tree', which has a structure similar to a concept map, was used. As a result, a great majority of pre-service teachers' alternative conceptions about the classification of plants were removed through this method of application.

AB  - Research in contemporary biology has become increasingly complex and organized around understanding biological processes in the context of systems. To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised "Gene-to-Evolution" (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students' ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

AB  - The visualisation of knowledge structures through concept mapping can be employed to reveal critical links between theory and practice. This allows consideration of particular disciplinary knowledge structures and the active role of the student in manipulating these structures to gain understanding, in a manner that can encourage students to contribute to the evolution of practice. The focus on knowledge structures can highlight the relationship between the curriculum and the discipline, and provides a tool to facilitate the integration of contemporary educational theories that may underpin teaching and curriculum development, such as learning styles, threshold concepts, conceptual stasis and semantic gravity. Visualisation invites original connections to be made between ideas and re-orientated to reveal new ways of conceptualising teaching at university: to include the structural transformation of knowledge as a potential threshold concept in higher education. © 2013 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.

AB  - This paper presents a framework for the evaluation of concept maps. We focus on supporting the student in dealing with ill-structured and complex problems. We argue that these problems require the application of the modularity approach. In view of this, the paper describes ways of providing student support for the implementation of this approach within the context of a concept mapping activity. As a basis we make use findings from the field of brain science and mathematical concepts and tools from the field of network theory, in order to present specific evaluation methods, the further development of which we consider extremely promising.

AB  - In this study, we investigated whether concept maps were used as often and as effectively in elementary science and technology classrooms as recommended by the National Ministry of Education (MEB) in the new curricula in Turkey. In the new elementary science and technology curricula, the MEB provides a general concept map for each unit. We used concept maps provided for the Light and Sound units for fourth, fifth, and sixth grades as content to determine whether students were able to use concept maps to gather information from them. Our analyses showed that most of the students did not use the concept maps to answer the questions. Rather they used their own knowledge and cognitive structures about light and sound to answer the questions. Therefore, we concluded that students do not know how to read the concept maps and gather knowledge from them. Also, we ran an Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test to explore whether grade level has an effect on students' performance in reading the concept maps and gathering information from them. We found that grade level has a significant effect on students' performance in using concept maps. © 2006-2013 by iSER, International Society of Educational Research. All Rights Reserved.

AB  - This paper described a practical use of kit-build concept map (KBCM) in science learning class in an elementary school in order to evaluate learners' understanding ongoing the teaching. The responsible teacher of the class reported that the information provided from KBCM is useful to decide complementary teaching ongoing class and improve his lesson plan of the next class. We have confirmed that the map scores in KBCM have significant correlation with the scores of standard test of science learning. This case study suggests that KBCM is a promising tool to estimate learners' understanding in classroom.

AB  - The greenhouse effect is a reasonably complex scientific phenomenon which can be used as a model to examine students' conceptual understanding in science. Primary student-teachers' understanding of global environmental problems, such as climate change and ozone depletion, indicates that they have many misconceptions. The present mixed method study examines Finnish primary student-teachers' understanding of the greenhouse effect based on the results obtained via open-ended and closed-form questionnaires. The open-ended questionnaire considers primary student-teachers' spontaneous ideas about the greenhouse effect depicted by concept maps. The present study also uses statistical analysis to reveal respondents' conceptualization of the greenhouse effect. The concept maps and statistical analysis reveal that the primary student-teachers' factual knowledge and their conceptual understanding of the greenhouse effect are incomplete and even misleading. In the light of the results of the present study, proposals for modifying the instruction of climate change in science, especially in geography, are presented. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Classroom-based science teaching tends to be dominated by teaching that stifles the students' natural curiosity and eagerness to discover their surroundings. Knowledge makes sense to students particularly when it is learned within the context of an authentic experience. Thus classroom-based science needs to be complimented by out-of-classroom activities which offer direct and relevant information that influences students' learning. Students build new knowledge on already existing schema, thus it is important for both teacher and students to question and evaluate their knowledge to be able to build on solid grounds. This paper illustrates examples of meta-cognitive tools (i.e. Vee diagrams and concept maps) used before and after site-visits to explore the contribution of out-of-classroom activities to the students' biological cognitive development. This research shows that site-visits are a necessary part of science learning because they help students develop observational and reasoning skills, link biology to personal life experiences and contextualise inert classroom knowledge, making it more meaningful and easier to remember.

AB  - This paper aims to lay the foundations to develop a dominant logic and a common thematic framework of strategic innovation (SI) and to encourage consensus over the field's core foundation of main themes. The paper explores the intersection between the constituent fields of strategic management and innovation management through a concept mapping process. The paper categorizes the main themes and search for common ground in order to develop the core thematic framework of SI. The paper looks at the subthemes of SI in published research and develops a more detailed framework. The conceptual categories derived from the process are then placed in a logical sequence according to how they occur in practice or in the order of how the concepts develop from one other. The results yield seven main themes that form the main taxonomy of SI: types of SI, environmental analysis of SI, SI planning, enabling SI, collaborative networks, managing knowledge, and strategic outcomes. The new thematic framework the paper is proposing for SI remains preliminary in nature and would need to be tried and tested by researchers and practitioners in order to gain acceptability. Academic rigor and methodological structure are not sufficient to determine whether our conceptual framework will become widely diffused in academia and industry. It would have to pass through an emergent, evolutionary process of selection, adoption and an inevitable degree of change and adaptation, just like any other innovation. The practical implications concern the production of instructive material and the application of strategic management initiatives in industry. The proposed themes and subthemes can serve as a logical framework to develop and update publications, which have been instrumental in their own right to shape the field. The paper also provides a checklist of potential research projects in SI, which will improve and strengthen the field. The new framework provides a comprehensive checklist of strategic management initiatives that will help industry to initiate, plan and execute effective innovation strategies. The concept mapping of the themes of SI yields a new dominant logic, which will influence the evolution of the field and its relevance to both academia and industry. © 2013, Emerald Group Publishing Limited

AB  - Concept map is a technique that arranges knowledge in a form of connected nodes. In our hypothesis, applying a concept map approach in teaching and learning History as a courseware can improve students' understanding and cognitive development. Therefore, we developed a courseware to complement the text book and were distributed to students in a Secondary School. For the purpose of this study, an experimental assessment was conducted among students where twenty students responded and went through the courseware assessment session. They filled in a form which was purposely designed to assess the effectiveness of the concept map instructional delivery and learner-friendliness of the design interface. In particular, the study looked at the effectiveness of a simulated learning experience, interface design as well as the technical aspects of the courseware. The findings from the study suggested that, in general, an implementation of concept map has been effective and useful. The outcome of the study concluded that concept map is one of the promising methods that can be effectively used to teach history in secondary students. © 2013 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - The goal of this study was to explore how designated experts (subject experts with extensive experience in science education and concept mapping) and novices (pre-service teachers) establish concept map (CM) development processes while considering their cognitive processes. Two experiments were conducted in which eye-tracking, written, and verbal data were collected from 29 novices and 6 subject matter experts. The results showed that despite some similar strategies, novices and experts followed different patterns during the CM development process. Both experts and novices embraced deductive reasoning and preferred hierarchical type CMs. Additional points studied during the process include filling out requested information in different orders, branch construction pattern, content richness and progress pattern. Furthermore, eye behavior patterns also differed among experts and novices. Expert participants differed from novices in all eye behavior metrics (fixation count, fixation and visit duration for specific actions). Novices' fixation count (FC) numbers were higher than the experts' during the entire process and in specific periods. In conclusion, these pattern differences affect the CM development process directly. Considering the patterns revealed in the study may help instructors guide learners more adequately and effectively. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper reports on teachers' use of concept mapping as an alternative assessment strategy in advanced level biology classes and its effects on students' cognitive skills on selected biology concepts. Using a mixed methods approach, the study employed a pre-test/post-test quasi-experimental design involving 156 students and 8 teachers from intact classes. A researcher-constructed Biology Cognitive Skills Test was used to collect the quantitative data. Qualitative data were collected through interviews and students' personal documents. The data showed that the participants utilized concept mapping in various ways and they described positive experiences while being engaged in its use. The main challenge cited by teachers was the limited time available for more consistent use. The results showed that the use of concept mapping in advanced level biology can lead to learning gains that exceed those achieved in classes where mainly traditional methods are used. The students in the concept mapping experimental groups performed significantly better than their peers in the control group on both the lower-order (F(1) = 21.508; p <.001) and higher-order (F(1) = 42.842, p <.001) cognitive items of the biology test. A mean effect size of.56 was calculated representing the contribution of treatment to the students' performance on the test items. © 2013 © 2013 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present some idea generation mapping methods in the context of product and process design teaching due to the important role that this methods can have in changing the usual thinking process and stimulating the creative thinking. Lifting the problem solving skills of the chemical engineering students by a small amount can have a huge effect on innovation and competitiveness. The role of idea mapping in chemical product and process design teaching is explored along with the discussion of the main characteristics of two different mapping methods, concept maps and mind maps. The distinctive characteristics are described along with an illustration and sample maps performed by a group of chemical engineering students showing the interest of ideas mapping in structuring the group thinking about a subject and allowing the group to gain new insights into the problem. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This study aimed to follow up on the research conducted by Ho, Wang, and Cheng (2013) and to develop a model of the scientific imagination using group concept mapping. Participants included five outstanding elementary school teachers and four researchers from southern Taiwan. The framework developed by Trochim (1989) was used as the basis for the construction of concept mappings of the scientific imagination through five panel discussions among the experts. A review of the literature, qualitative interviews, classroom observation, and document analyses were performed on group concept mapping, and independent relevant documents were used for data validation. A qualitative method was employed for data analysis. Finally, we developed the personality, developmental process, picture-in-mind, and surroundings (3PS) model of scientific imagination. Research results indicated that the scientific imagination model not only enhanced understanding of scientific imagination but also applied to daily experiences. The results of the present study are relevant to future projects and research in this domain, including the development of academic-based checklists to foster scientific imagination, the establishment of appropriate assessment tools, and the formulation of a specific curriculum for teaching the concept of scientific imagination. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - In the present paper, we carry out the application of concept mapping strategies to learning Physical Chemistry, in particular, of all aspects of Corrosion. This strategy is an alternative method to supplement examinations: it can show the teacher how much the students knew and how much they didn't know; and the students can evaluate their own learning. Before giving the matter on Corrosion, the teachers evaluated the previous knowledge of the students in the field and explained to the students how create the conceptual maps with Cmap tools. When the subject is finished, teachers are assessed the conceptual maps developed by students and therefore also the level of the students learning. Teachers verified that the concept mapping is quite suitable for complicated theories as Corrosion and it is an appropriate tool for the consolidation of educational experiences and for improvement affective lifelong learning. By using this method we demonstrated that the set of concepts accumulated in the cognitive structure of every student is unique and every student has therefore arranged the concepts from top to bottom in the mapping field in different ways with different "linking" phrases, although these are involved in the same learning task. © SGEM2013 All Rights Reserved by the International Multidisciplinary Scientific GeoConference SGEM.

AB  - Relational concepts play a central role in human perception and cognition, but little is known about how they are acquired. For example, how do we come to understand that physical force is a higher-order multiplicative relation between mass and acceleration, or that two circles are the same-shape in the same way that two squares are? A recent model of relational learning, DORA (Discovery of Relations by Analogy; Doumas, Hummel & Sandhofer, 2008), predicts that comparison and analogical mapping play a central role in the discovery and predication of novel higher-order relations. We report two experiments testing and confirming this prediction. © 2013 Doumas, Hummel.

AB  - The use of concept mapping as a tool to measure the meaningful learning of students is the focus of this study. The study was carried out with 24 last year students (22 years old) from the Department of Chemistry Teaching at Fatih Faculty of Education, Karadeniz Technical University (KTU). Prospective Chemistry Teachers (PCT) were asked to create concept maps using a list of given concepts related to gases. An examination of the PCTs' maps revealed that the students could not form hierarchical maps even after being shown examples of the basic elements and meaningful propositions between the concepts. After being provided with feedback about their concept maps and trained to form non-hierarchical concept maps, the students were asked to create new maps. This time they were allowed to use either hierarchical or non-hierarchical maps. When their new maps were examined, we found that most of the PCTs formed non-hierarchical maps. However, they still could not form meaningful relationships between the given concepts. We also found that the PCTs had some misconceptions about gases and kinetic molecular theory that explains gas behavior. The study ended up with some suggestions and implications for educators and researchers related to pre-service teachers' training. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - Self-evaluation is not an easy step for learners even if it is a decisive step in self-regulated learning. The goal of our study was to test concept maps effect on learning performance and self-evaluation accuracy. 136 students were assigned over five experimental groups in which the format used (consultation/construction) and the moment of use (simultaneous of the learning task vs. after the learning task) of concept map varied. Cognitive load was also measured in order to explain differences in performance and self-evaluation. Results suggested that participants in the consultation conditions have a more accurate self-evaluation and better performance than participants in the construction condition. More studies are required to identify more precisely what factors influence the efficiency of use conceptual map.

AB  - Children's challenging behaviors can be addressed with effective interventions that can meet children's emotional needs and support their families. Positive Behavioral Interventions and Supports (PBIS) value the family involvement in the process of their child treatment. The intention of this study was to use concept mapping as an adjunct to PBIS in an ecological setting. Participants were a four years old boy diagnosed with ADHD and his mother. A multiple-probe baseline across family routines design was used to evaluate the usefulness of concept mapping as an adjunct to the PBIS process (independent variable) on the level of task-engagement behaviors, challenging behaviors, and parent fidelity of implementation (dependent variables) across three routines. Results recognized concept mapping as a promising practice in parent education. © by the author(s).

AB  - A teachable agent (TA) is an instructional technology that capitalizes on the organizing metaphor of teaching another, in this case, a computer agent. As one instance, students teach their agents by creating concept maps that connect nodes with relational links. TAs use simple artificial intelligence to draw conclusions based on what they have been taught and to trace the path of their reasoning visually. TAs literally make thinking visible, with the goal of helping children learn to reason. TAs also provide interactive feedback and engender in students a sense of responsibility toward improving their agents' knowledge. We describe, in detail, a TA designed to teach hierarchical reasoning in science, and then present a 2-year research study using this TA with 153 fourth-grade children learning about organisms, taxonomies, and ecosystems. We show that the TA improved learning from the standard curriculum as measured by the curriculum's accompanying tests. The TA also helped children learn hierarchical reasoning, as measured by researcher-designed tests. The research indicates that, contrary to some theoretical positions, it is possible to help younger children learn scientific modes of reasoning, specifically by means of TA software. © 2008-2011 IEEE.

AB  - Since 2009 at Boston College, we have been offering a Research in Neuroscience course using cultured neurons in an in vitro model of stroke. The students work in groups to learn how to perform sterile animal cell culture and run several basic bioassays to assess cell viability. They are then tasked with analyzing the scientific literature in an attempt to identify and predict the intracellular pathways involved in neuronal death, and identify dietary antioxidant compounds that may provide protection based on their known effects in other cells. After each group constructs a hypothesis pertaining to the potential neuroprotection, we purchase one compound per group and the students test their hypotheses using a commonly performed viability assay. The groups generate quantitative data and perform basic statistics on that data to analyze it for statistical significance. Finally, the groups compile their data and other elements of their research experience into a poster for our departmental research celebration at the end of the spring semester. © 2013 Faculty for Undergraduate Neuroscience.

AB  - Efforts to attract quality and diverse students into civil engineering have given rise to engineering camps aimed at secondary school students. Innovative topics such as soil liquefaction and sustainability are typically studied in depth within civil engineering graduate programs. However, worldwide attention to these topics has been generated throughout society through recent natural events such as the earthquake in New Zealand and storm surge effects in New York and New Orleans, along with the on-going issue of global warming. These phenomena have been connected in a way to begin educating secondary school students, while simultaneously encouraging an interest in engineering. This connection was accomplished through the development and implementation of two teaching modules, targeting 13 to 16 year old students. The soil liquefaction module is aimed at familiarizing students with the term as well as fundamental engineering concepts related to the topic. Experiments were conducted both on a small-scale shake table available at select universities and a widely available teaching device for fluidized beds. Students took various measurements and made calculations of soil density before and after liquefaction. For the sustainability module, the students were introduced to key concepts related to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Two activities were implemented with regards to ecological footprint and green building. Students calculated their ecological footprint based on a survey of lifestyle-related questions and compared their impacts to average values in developing countries. In addition, they completed a case study assessment of exemplary green buildings and developed a concept map depicting the project's applicability to the triple bottom line goals. To simplify the task of implementing the modules, detailed procedures for the experiments and activities, along with worksheets for the students have been developed for interested instructors. The modules have been tested at Bucknell University during the summers of 2011 and 2012, and survey assessment results from student evaluation confirm that the modules are effective in meeting the defined objectives of each topic. The overall goal of the assessment was to establish student learning in the modules. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2013.

AB  - One of the most difficult tasks in teaching is evaluating how students assimilate the content; this holds at all levels of education. Tests and homework only show so much, as the performance on those evaluations may be a stronger indication of how much effort each student is putting into the course. In addition, large classes and the relative lack of communication between the instructor and his/her students make it difficult to know exactly how students are learning course material. One approach is to have students create concept maps once they have finished the course4. A concept map is essentially a mental web of connected terms or topics, where the centermost term is the primary learning focus and lines are used to connect related concepts. This results in a web of interconnected concepts that reflect the way students assimilate the new information. The three main questions guiding the study reported here are: 1) How can we decode the variety of ideas and structures that students include in their concept maps? 2) How can we use discoveries from this decoding to make lectures and labs more effective? 3) What improvements can be made to the way students are assigned drawing concept maps to further increase the usefulness of concept maps in capturing their learning? The dataset for this study focuses on concept maps developed by undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory solid mechanics course taken by many prospective engineering majors (primarily freshmen and sophomores) in the winter quarter of 2013. In the final week of the course, students were tasked with creating a concept map of the various terms and topic areas covered during the ten-week course. In analyzing these maps, terms were weighted based on their location in reference to the centermost term of the map. Information regarding the proximity of the terms to each other and which terms are connected was also drawn from the concept map dataset. This first round of analysis indicates that students, for the most part, were drawing the expected connections between the different terms and topics. However, there were instances where students isolated topics, missed topics, or had them wrongly associated. This suggests that it may be beneficial for the teaching team to more explicitly or repeatedly connect certain topics throughout the course in lectures, class exercises and homework assignments. Suggestions for improving the concept map assignment are also discussed. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2014.

AB  - Knowledge Organization Systems (KOSs) are extensively used in the biomedical domain to support information sharing between software applications. KOSs are proposed covering different, but overlapping subjects, and mappings indicate the semantic relation between concepts from two KOSs. Over time, KOSs change as do the mappings between them. This can result from a new discovery or a revision of existing knowledge which includes corrections of concepts or mappings. Indeed, changes affecting KOS entities may force the underline mappings to be updated in order to ensure their reliability over time. To tackle this open research problem, we study how mappings are affected by KOS evolution. This article presents a detailed descriptive analysis of the impact that changes in KOS have on mappings. As a case study, we use the official mappings established between SNOMED CT and ICD-9-CM from 2009 to 2011. Results highlight factors according to which KOS changes in varying degrees influence the evolution of mappings. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Traditional eBook is to put the content of a book from hardcopy paper format into electronic mobile device format. Nevertheless, with evolution of mobile computing, information can be spread in seconds by mobile phones in multi-media format. Therefore, a student may need to put his/her learning material in an eBook which can be accessed by mobile device so that the student can study at any time and at anywhere using the mobile device. An authoring eBook allows students selects his/her own lecture slides from teacher's power point files, relevant discussion from open forum, cognitive map from course concept map, and video recording from lectures etc. This paper presents a methodology that can let students tailor make his/her own learning material from different multi-media source, and which can be edited as students' learning level improves. The stepwise development procedure includes preprocess of converting discussion panel and mind maps into images, uploading document, video, audio and images into PDF files, concatenate PDF files into an eBook PDF file, and modify the eBook PDF files if needed. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - We present an experimental study of topic models applied to the analysis of functional magnetic resonance images. This study is motivated by the hypothesis that experimental task contrast images share a common set of mental concepts. We represent the images as documents and the mental concepts as topics, and evaluate the effectiveness of unsupervised topic models for the recovery of the task to mental concept mapping, We also evaluate supervised topic models that explicitly incorporate the experimental task labels. Comparing the quality of the recovered topic assignments to known mental concepts, we find that the supervised models are more effective than unsupervised approaches. The quantitative performance results are supported by a visualization of the recovered topic assignment probabilities. Our results motivate the use of supervised topic models for analyzing cognitive function with fMRI. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Current social networking services provide ways to access to huge amounts of information in different contexts. However, these applications are still not oriented to managing knowledge or facilitating learning processes. Aiming to help users to access, create, validate and distribute their knowledge, we propose the design of a prototype combining multiple views to support highly contextual learning. This prototype consists on a mobile application based on diverse functionalities and interaction mechanisms currently used in social networking services. With this application, users will be able to register elements from their surrounding environment in form of micronotes, concepts, images, or other media. These knowledge blocks can be processed and rendered in different views (text, map, calendar, concept map, timeline), and augmented with information related to their space, time, and reference contextual information. © Springer International Publishing 2013.

AB  - Concept maps are playing an increasingly important role in various computing fields. In particular, they have been popularly used for organizing and representing knowledge. However, constructing concept maps manually is a complex and time-consuming task. Therefore, the creation of concept maps automatically or semi-automatically from text documents is a worthwhile research challenge. Recently, various approaches for automatic or semi-automatic construction of concept maps have been proposed. However, these approaches suffer from several limitations. First, only the noun phrases in text documents are included without resolution of the anaphora problems for pronouns. This omission causes important propositions available in the text documents to be missed, resulting in decreased recall. Second, although some approaches label the relationship to form propositions, they do not show the direction of the relationship between the subject and object in the form of Subject-Relationship- Object, leading to ambiguous propositions. In this paper, we present a cluster-based approach to semi-automatically construct concept maps from text documents. First, we extract the candidate terms from documents using typed dependency linguistic rules. Anaphoric resolution for pronouns is introduced to map the pronouns with candidate terms. Second, the similarities are calculated between the pairs of extracted candidate terms of a document and clusters are made through affinity propagation by providing the calculated similarities between the candidate terms. Finally, the extracted relationships are assigned between the candidate terms in each cluster. Our empirical results show that the semi-automatically constructed concept maps conform to the outputs generated manually by domain experts, since the degree of difference between them is proportionally small based on a Likert scale. Furthermore, domain experts verified that the constructed concept maps are in accordance with their knowledge of the information system domain. © The Author(s) 2013.

AB  - This paper proposes a visualization tool for supporting representation construction via constraint-based approach. A physics problem can be represented as an operational concept map (OCM) by identifying important concepts and relationships among these concepts from the problem scenario. This form of representation enables the visualization tool to assist a solver to construct a graphical, simulation-enabled concept map regarding a specific physics problem solving. To help solvers construct problem representation and validate its corresponding hypothetical relationships, an OCM integrates the organization function of concept map with hypothesis simulation capability. The application of an OCM is further introduced with a kinematics problem in order to demonstrate the features of hypothesis creations, evaluation, and revision with feedback messages. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Following earlier studies aimed at gaining a deeper understanding of digital competence through a review of literature and current digital competence frameworks, this paper focuses on experts' views on digital competence. It describes the results of a Delphi study investigating experts' ideas on what it means to be digitally competent today. The study involved two online consultations, one directed at gathering individual ideas and one directed at validating the aggregated mapping of digital competence, established through various qualitative and quantitative data analysis steps. The paper describes and discusses the final results from the Delphi study involving 95 experts from across Europe and beyond. Results indicate that digital competence is built up of knowledge, skills, and attitudes pertaining to twelve different areas. Besides, results show that several issues of debate can be identified when it comes to establishing the boundaries of digital competence. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: Although there are screening tools to aid clinicians in assessing the risk of opioid misuse, an instrument to assess opioid-related knowledge is not currently available. The purpose of this study was to develop a content-valid, understandable, readable, and reliable Patient Opioid Education Measure (POEM). Methods: Using concept mapping, clinicians caring for patients with chronic pain participated in brainstorming, sorting, and rating need-to-know information for patients prescribed opioids. Concept mapping analyses identifed seven clusters addressing knowledge and expectations associated with opioid use, including medicolegal issues, prescribing policies, safe use and handling, expected outcomes, side effects, pharmacology, and warnings. Results: The 49-item POEM was verbally administered to 83 patients (average age 51.3 ± 9.8 years, 77.1% female, 47.1% African American) taking opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain. Patients averaged in total 63.9% ± 14.3% (range 23%-91%) correct responses on the POEM. The POEM demonstrated substantial test-retest reliability (interclass correlation coeffcient 0.87). The POEM had a mean readability Lexile (L) score of 805.9 ± 257.3 L (equivalent to approximately a US ffth grade reading level), with individual items ranging from 280 L to 1370 L. Conclusion: The POEM shows promise for rapidly identifying patients' opioid-related knowledge gaps and expectations. Correcting misunderstandings and gaps could result in safer use of opioids in a clinical care setting. © 2013 Wallace et al.

AB  - This article presents the results of the evaluation of SCIViS - a visualization-based scientific information retrieval (IR) system. SCIViS is based on the logic of concept maps and enables the visualization of relationships among descriptors and authors of scientific papers. It creates an interactive interface between the user's cognitive space and document information space. The system was evaluated by the group of 138 psychology students which have performed a variety of search tasks, using both the classic text-based and the visualization based IR systems. The SCIViS model has proved to be effective and intuitive. Participants were more efficient using the visual IR system, particularly when performing tasks requiring modifications of the initial query and finding alternative keywords. User responses indicated that system's speed and ease of use are the most important attributes of the overall assessment. They also revealed the impact of users' previous experience with IR systems on users' satisfaction and perception of usefulness. Previous experience may be regarded both as the rate of success in performing search tasks, as well as the familiarity with popular search engines. The later one seems to be an important factor in modeling users' information seeking behavior and their attitudes toward alternative IR models. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled "Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)" has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students' learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed. © 2014 American Meteorological Society.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using concept mapping strategy in teaching physics on the attitude towards physics. Participants were (46) first year students from two classes enrolled to the course "Fundamentals of Physics I", in Dhofar University, Oman. One of the classes was randomly selected as experimental group (23), while the other was a control group (23). The data was collected via the pre- and post attitude scale. The study was conducted within a period of 8 weeks and the class had three lessons in a week. The material covered was about mechanics. The results showed that there was a significant difference at (α=0.05) in the attitude towards physics between the experimental and the control group. The study also showed that there was no significant difference attributed to the gender and the interaction between teaching methods and gender.

AB  - In order to use concept maps in physics classes effectively, teachers' knowledge and ideas about concept mapping are as important as the physics knowledge used in mapping. For this reason, we aimed to examine pre-service physics teachers' knowledge on concept mapping, their ideas about the implementation of concept mapping in physics classes, the hidden elements influencing their ideas, and the relations between knowledge and ideas, qualitatively. The participants of this study were eight pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the physics education department at two state universities. The results of the interviews conducted with the participants and their artifacts revealed that although pre-service physics teachers had basic knowledge about concept mapping, they had some negative ideas about implementation in physics classes. Furthermore, language, limitation in assessment, limitation in expressions, and teacher's knowledge were identified as the sources of pre-service physics teachers' negative ideas. © 2014 by iSER.

AB  - Creating learning experiences that are meaningful and motivational is crucial in learning. Research demonstrates that effectively organizing ideas via concept maps allows students to view prior knowledge with new perspectives. Recently, embodied computation has emerged as an effective means of meeting educational objectives due to its intuitive, gesture-based control and to its promotion of associating knowledge with physical events. Unfortunately, a majority of systems tailored for such interaction are expensive prototypes. However, the release of depth cameras has brought embodied interaction into the commercial realm, allowing users' bodies to "become" controllers. This research presents a novel, low cost system that provides embodied interaction with a computer and depth camera, through which learners can create concept maps with gestures. Current work involves defining intuitive gestural controls. Future work will involve evaluating the system for use in a classroom with the aim to create opportunities to easily incorporate embodiment into collaborative learning. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2013.

AB  - Objective: To incorporate a concept mapping assignment as an active learning strategy in a pharmaceutics course and evaluate student perceptions about this new activity. Design: A total of 67 students were given an individual and group concept mapping assignments to analyze the interrelationships of physicochemical properties, formulation factors, and excipient requirements of a specific dosage form. A student satisfaction survey was administered to collect student perceptions about the activity anonymously. Assessment: All students and student groups successfully completed concept maps based on the rubric provided by the faculty. A total of 46 students (69%) completed the satisfaction survey. Overall, students reported that the use of concept mapping improved their understanding of the course material. Conclusions: The concept map assignment allowed students to visualize how different properties of individual dosage forms are interrelated. It is a useful tool for integrating instructional concepts in a pharmaceutics course and beyond. Concept maps enhance learning experiences and lead to a better understanding of the fundamental concepts. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Good conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what the key concepts are and how they are related. This kind of understanding is especially important for physics teachers in planning how and in what order to introduce concepts in teaching; connections which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress-there is "flux of information" so that what was learned before provides the basis for learning new ideas. In this study, we discuss how such ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how they can be used in analysing the students' views and ideas about the inherent logic of the teaching plans. The approach discussed here is informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge organisation concentrating on simple knowledge organisation patterns and how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The analysis of such concept networks is then very naturally based on the use of network theory on analysing the concept maps. The results show that even in well-connected maps, there can be abrupt changes in the information flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a pre-service teacher to master. © 2012 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - The co-evolution model of collaborative knowledge building by Cress and Kimmerle (2008) assumes that cognitive and social processes interact when users build knowledge with shared digital artifacts. While these assumptions have been tested in various lab experiments, a test under natural field conditions in educational settings has not been conducted. Here, we present a field experiment where we triggered knowledge co-evolution in an accommodation and an assimilation condition, and measured effects on student knowledge building outside the laboratory in the context of two university courses. Therefore, 48 students received different kinds of prompts that triggered external accommodation and assimilation while writing a wiki text. Knowledge building was measured with a content analysis of the students' texts and comments (externalization), and with concept maps and association tests (internalization). The findings reveal that (a) different modes of externalization (accommodation and assimilation) could be triggered with prompts, (b) across both conditions, this externalization co-occurred with internalization (student learning), and (c) there is some evidence that external assimilation and accommodation had differential effects on internal assimilation and accommodation. Thus, the field experiment supports the assumptions of the co-evolution model in a realistic course setting. On a more general note, the study provides an example of how wikis can be used successfully for collaborative knowledge building within educational contexts. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Abstract. The aim of this study is to investigate the combination effect of concept mapping and vee diagrams as thinking tools in Chemistry among some 360 secondary students in Indonesia. This study employed a quasi-experimental ap-proach whereby students were segregated into three intervention groups: concept mapping, vee diagram and thinking skills embedded throughout the lesson (E1), concept mapping (E2) and a conven-tional approach (E3). Students were also characterized in terms of their ability: High (H), Moderate (M) and Low (L). Students' thinking skills were measured using a modified version of the Test of Integrated Process Skills (TIPS), which has beed sys-tematically justified in terms of reliability and validity. Analysis of findings reveal that the EI approach is the most effective technique in inculcating students' thinking skills. A series of follow-up analyses also demonstrate that the E1 approach is best suited for the high ability (H) students as compared to their moderate (M) and low (L) ability counterparts.

AB  - Structured argumentation support environments have been built and used in scientific discourse in the literature. These environments emphasized either on exchanging information or on constructing arguments for presentation. In this work, an intelligent online asynchronous argumentation platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. After each learner issues an argument on the learning platform, a term weighting method is adopted to derive inputs parameters of a SVM classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' arguments are related to the concept maps outlined by the instructor. Notably, a peer review mechanism is established in this work to improve the quality of term weighting approach. The experimental results revealed that the students in a junior high school participating in argumentation learning activities of natural science were benefited by the proposed argumentation based learning assistance platform. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - This article explores how to design for product longevity. The design approach Contexts of Experience (COE) makes the basis for this interdisciplinary study which combines research on consumer-product attachment (CPA) and related psychological mechanisms, design and design practice. The conceptual design approach COE was explored through a case study with student projects on master's level in product design and interviews. One specific project namely the "Spa radiator" that to a great extent infused various experiences as part of the product made the main subject for this study. Through the case analysis done by concept mapping, five different Levels of Activation (LoA) were disclosed: cognitive, motional, relational, perceptive and imaginative. The activation dimension identified is argued to have emerged primarily through the process of making experiences for different contexts of use and the awareness of psychological mechanisms, facilitated by the COE approach. The COE approach seems therefore to contribute to the making of products that facilitate the modelling of memories and associations through user activation. As these emotions and thoughts are potentially tied up to the product it seems essential to create functions that elicit different levels of activation in order to design for product longevity and hence the environment. Memories can furthermore contribute to the commercial value of products since the experiences they elicit are closely tied to brand value. The LoA is therefore suggested as an analytical and creative tool in order to evaluate the ability of a design concept to stimulate CPA, in addition to the COE approach.

AB  - The Online Course Tool for Adaptive Learning (OCTAL) is an adaptive exercise system that customizes the progression of question topics to each student. By creating a concept dependency graph of topics in a course and modeling a student's knowledge state, the tool presents questions that test knowledge within a student's zone of proximal development. We intend OCTAL to be a formative assessment tool that is not tied to any specific course by providing language-agnostic questions on computer science concepts. While the tool will be generalizable for many courses, our first prototype includes a concept map and question set for UC Berkeley's introductory computer science course, CS10: The Beauty and Joy of Computing. Using the tool, we will launch an experiment in the spring to investigate metacognitive improvements in the identification of knowledge gaps by presenting online course material in a nonlinear fashion.

AB  - In this paper, we describe the effects of using Kit-Build concept map (KB-map) method as a supportive tool for the reading comprehension of English texts as EFL reading. Reading comprehension is the ability to read text, it is intentional, active, interactive process in all the stages of study for the students and in the daily working activities. One of the most common research points in this field is the English as Foreign Language (EFL) reading comprehension. We have conducted an experiment composed of six experimental reading comprehension sessions. We found that there is no significant difference in the comprehension between the two conditions groups just after the experimental using, but there is noticed difference in the comprehension two weeks after. It shows that the using of KB-map building helps learners to keep their information for long time, and we can say that the using of KB-Map help the students to use and recall, after two weeks, most of the information that are included in their student map. © 2014 Springer International Publishing.

AB  - This study aims to investigate the effects of creating concept maps by using paper and pencil on primary school students critical thinking skills in science education. Experimental research model was used with pre- and post-test control group design. The participants of the study were 60 6th graders (ages 11-12) at a primary school, which was randomly chosen among the public primary schools in Uskudar, Istanbul, during the 2011-2012 school period. The experimental group and the control group were designated objectively among the student groups that have similar characteristics. Implementation period had lasted for 20 class hours in total. The reliability coefficient of the critical thinking skills scale (the Cronbach alpha) was 0.87. It was seen that there were significant differences between the critical thinking scores of the students who created their concept maps by using paper and pencil and those of the students who were instructed not to create the concept maps. Thus, it could be said that creating the concept maps enables the students to develop their critical thinking skills in science education.

AB  - The iCollaborate Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) project is a comprehensive research program that has an overarching goal of improving student outcomes in introductory materials engineering courses. The project is multifaceted and includes several interwoven components, all of which are founded upon literature based best practices in STEM education. The project components include: a detailed study of precourse knowledge and misperceptions, an investigation of student preparation influencing course outcomes, an analysis of Index of Learning Styles (ILS) data, a switch to inductive teaching practices which include collaborative, active learning modules and concept/peer learning opportunities, collaborative writing of research papers, low stakes quizzing, the development of targeted iPod applications that promote enhanced student understanding of known conceptual difficulties, MSE vocabulary terms, visual and conceptually contained presentations of material properties, material calculators and conversion tools, and the development of a web site based upon concept maps. The project includes formative and summative assessment elements. This paper focuses on previously unreported components of the iCollaborate project that were researched, analyzed or developed during the 2011-2012 academic year. A detailed analysis of student preparation coupled with the comprehensive study of pre-course conceptual knowledge and misperceptions provided particularly rich and extremely informative data sets that are outlined in this paper. Additionally, students perceive that low stakes quizzing improve personal outcomes more than the targeted, collaborative and active modules and iPod applications, but traditional test scores indicate all three enhance certain student learning outcomes when at least two are present. The entire suite of MSE iPod applications developed for this project (Concept Questions, Vocabulary, Basic Knowledge, Tune-Up, Material Properties, Composite Calculator, MSE Convert, MSE Knowledge Tools and Review) is described in detail. The supporting web site for the project is currently under development, is concept mapped based, built upon student input/assessments, and targeted to address known conceptual difficulties in MSE. The concept map base for the project is reported in this paper. The paper concludes with a description of the remaining objectives for the iCollaborate project for the next academic year and further dissemination plans. At the conclusion of the project, all materials will be placed on the NSF sponsored National Science Digital Library (NSDL).

AB  - The development of information technology brought a new prospect for the network study, the adaptive learning has been possible to meet learner's individual requirements. The learning based on case may provide the simulation situation for the learner, but the adaptive learning takes on the both superiority of the Case-based Learning and simulation situation. It take the case as the study object, shields the relations between various concepts in the case, and simplified concept map. And also, it presents the learner's cognition abilities with belief vector, contacts learner's learning capability with the case. It can make students learn cases orderly with different levels, and it can make it possible of efficient study. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - The challenge of teaching new subject matter is a familiar one for most teachers. This paper investigates the content knowledge gains made by seven teachers as they learn to teach the topic of semiconductors through a process of self-study. 'Semiconductors' is a new topic in the curriculum which looks at the sub-microscopic properties of materials used in electronics and is important because of its applications in modern technology. We present a phenomenographic analysis of 21 concept maps produced by seven teachers at various stages of their self-study project. Four categories of description emerged in the analysis, viz. no meaning, orientation to understanding of subject matter (SMK), a pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) context focus, and a PCK strategy focus. The last category proved to be the most interesting as it suggested that the teacher saw the learning of SMK and learning to teach the SMK as a single process. This finding was considered as important in understanding how teachers learn new SMK for teaching. We found that experienced teachers make sense of their new SMK in different ways. There is a variation of orientation in their learning and sense-making. The data also showed progression of teachers' understanding of the topic through the self-study process. The findings suggest that learning SMK for the purposes of teaching is different to learning for fulfilling the requirements of a study programme. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A concept map for taking biodiversity to school is proposed here using a novel approach that combines systematics, evolutionary biology, and the nature of science. The concept map is tied to the recently published next generation science standards (NGSS). The problem of biodiversity is presented as a way to justify the need to take it to school. Biological classification is presented as a hypothesis about order in nature that is based on the evolutionary history of the organisms. Classification is the reference system of the entirety of biology with predictive and explanatory power. Homology is the concept that connects systematics to evolutionary biology. Evolutionary biology explains and systematics reflects the unity and diversity of life. © Copyright 2014 by the American Society of Plant Taxonomists.

AB  - This study was undertaken with the goal of developing a Concept Map Knowledge Management System (CMKMS) for use as a tool in observing change in a student's understanding of biology concepts over time. The CMKMS should be useful in assessing the extent of a student's knowledge and in revealing their unique thought processes. The study was concerned not only with a student's self-evaluation of learning but also with their level of satisfaction after using the CMKMS. The CMKMS combines the diagnosis of concept mapping with the style of thought processing, and promotes teaching activities step-by-step, in order to promote effective student learning. In analyzing the factors that influence the effect of teaching, the teacher can determine a student's knowledge structure and highlight misconceptions by inspecting the concept maps and logs. The results of this study show that knowledge management involved in computer-aided instruction in the teaching of biology had a positive influence on learning effectiveness. The CMKMS also was useful in promoting the student's thought processing, creativity, and ability to judge. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Interactive tabletops can be used to provide new ways to support face-to-face collaborative learning. A little explored and somewhat hidden potential of these devices is that they can be used to enhance teachers' awareness of students' progress by exploiting captured traces of interaction. These data can make key aspects of collaboration visible and can highlight possible problems. In this paper, we explored the potential of an enriched tabletop to automatically and unobtrusively capture data from collaborative interactions. By analyzing that data, there was the potential to discover trends in students' activity. These can help researchers, and eventually teachers, to become aware of the strategies followed by groups. We explored whether it was possible to differentiate groups, in terms of the extent of collaboration, by identifying the interwoven patterns of students' speech and their physical actions on the interactive surface. The analysis was validated on a sample of 60 students, working in triads in a concept mapping learning activity. The contribution of this paper is an approach for analyzing students' interactions around an enriched interactive tabletop that is validated through an empirical study that shows its operationalization to extract frequent patterns of collaborative activity. © 2013 International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc. and Springer Science+Business Media New York.

AB  - We have argued that apps can be used in innovative ways to support science and literacy learning. With the skilled guidance of teachers, students can exploit app affordances for learning and use disciplinary literacies unique to science. For example, students can build conceptual understanding and communicate ideas through the use of concept-mapping, note-taking/annotation, and screencasting apps. These apps allow students to access information and create their own digital products that include rich visual representations. The use of note-taking/annotation apps further supports close reading of science texts. One key affordance across apps involves an awareness of the potential for transfer of visual and verbal analysis. This is evidenced in the use of drawing in the ShowMe and VoiceThread apps, which foster the use of visual representations and narration to convey ideas. The act of inviting viewer commentary into the projects encouraged students to revise the construction of their ideas, their drawings, and verbal explanations. Take Action offers additional ideas for instructional uses of these apps. Our classroom examples serve to illustrate that these app affordances were not simply in the apps but, rather, that they were fostered by how teachers exploited these affordances to achieve their own specific learning objectives. This suggests that, as with any learning tool, teachers who are beginning to incorporate apps into their instruction need to carefully consider how to use these tools in ways that best serve to enhance their students' learning. © 2013 International Reading Association.

AB  - Knowledge structure is an important aspect for defining students' competency in biology learning, but how knowledge structure is influenced by the teaching process in naturalistic biology classroom settings has scarcely been empirically investigated. In this study, 49 biology lessons in the teaching unit blood and circulatory system in 9th grade German classrooms were videotaped and analyzed. Before the lesson, a questionnaire was administered to the students to solicit their responses about learning motivation. After the lesson, students' learning outcomes on knowledge structure were examined with the concept mapping method. The video coding used in this study focused on the knowledge linking levels during the biology lesson. Out of the 49 classes, those with the highest and those with the lowest linking levels were selected based on the coding results. In high-linking classes, interrelated facts were introduced more often in the lessons, whereas in the lessons of the low-linking classes, isolated pieces of knowledge were predominant. The results from the concept mapping task showed that the students in the high-linking classes constructed more correct relations among the concepts compared to the students in the low-linking classes. The results remained stable even after controlling for learning motivation. These findings confirm the importance of teaching interrelated facts and concepts instead of isolated facts for fostering students' knowledge structure. As a result, based on the Bavarian biology curriculum, we develop materials and programs to enable students, student teachers, and teachers to focus on interrelated facts and basic concepts instead of isolated facts in biology lessons. © 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - What is environment? The answer to this question is fundamental to how we teach environmental studies and sciences (ESS). We follow recent scholarly literature in approaching environment as connection, not as some category of reality, and consider pedagogical implications via concept mapping, a new learning technology. Concept maps potentially offer a visually explicit means of representing and analyzing the hybrid connections between actors that define environmental issues. We explore the utility of concept mapping as pioneered by Joseph Novak and others via the Cmap Tools application, in which concept maps (cmaps) consist of concepts connected by propositions; both can include linked resources, and the resultant cmap can be collaboratively edited and shared online. We evaluate concept mapping in the context of a sophomore-level environmental methods course taught annually at Lewis & Clark College. The course includes adaptations of concept mapping drawing on Novak's work and actor-network theory, designed for students to reflect on their environmental perspectives, synthesize course material, and explore a proposed topic for environmental research. These exercises were evaluated in fall 2010 using self-reports, assessment rubrics, and open-ended student responses. Results showed that higher achieving students generally found concept mapping more demanding and attained more sophisticated understandings of connections. This suggests that concept mapping helps facilitate the intellectual struggle that characterizes engaged learning, yet also that not all students embrace this struggle to fully grasp environment-as-connection. In a larger sense, the study illustrates challenges in cultivating new approaches to environment in the ESS community. © 2013 AESS.

AB  - The study aims to investigate the effects of using mind maps and concept maps on students' learning of concepts in science courses. A total of 51 students participated in this study which used a quasi-experimental research design with pre-test/post-test control groups. The constructivist-inspired study was carried out in the sixth-grade science course unit of 'Light and Sound' in a primary school with two experimental groups and one control group. The intervention was held in the experimental group 1 by using technology-assisted technique of mind mapping, in the experimental group 2 by using technology-assisted technique of concept mapping, and in the control group by means of traditional classroom instruction. After the intervention in the experimental groups, concept tests and open-ended questions related to the unit were used as post-tests. According to the data obtained from concept tests, it was found out that all groups' understanding of concepts was equivalent. Significantly, students in the experimental group 2 reported positive opinions, stating that learning through concept maps was useful and engaging. © 2013 Educational Studies Association of Ireland.

AB  - Ausubel and Novak's construct of meaningful learning stipulates that substantive connections between new knowledge and what is already known requires the integration of thinking, feeling, and performance (Novak J. D., (2010), Learning, creating, and using knowledge: concept maps as facilitative tools in schools and corporations, New York, NY: Routledge Taylor & Francis Group.). This study explores the integration of these three domains using a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. A tripartite model was developed to examine meaningful learning through the correlational relationships among thinking, feeling, and performance using student responses regarding Intellectual Accessibility and Emotional Satisfaction on the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory version 2 (ASCI V2) and performance on the American Chemical Society exam. We compared the primary model to seven alternatives in which correlations were systematically removed in order to represent a lack of interconnectedness among the three domains. The tripartite model had the strongest statistical fit, thereby providing statistical evidence for the construct of meaningful learning. Methodological issues associated with SEM techniques, including problems related to non-normal multivariate distributions (an assumption of traditional SEM techniques), and causal relationships are considered. Additional findings include evidence for weak configural invariance in the pre/post implementation of the ASCI(V2), mainly due to the poor structure of the pretest data. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for teaching and learning. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - This paper investigates an experienced high school science teacher's content knowledge for teaching Doppler Effect to Grade 12 learners. The topic is new in the physical science National Curriculum Statement and therefore posing some difficulties for teachers when teaching. The aim of this paper is to investigate the content knowledge that the teacher has in order to teach this unfamiliar topic. A research question about what content knowledge for teaching does an experienced teacher possess is answered in this paper. A teacher was interviewed and observed when teaching. A concept map was then constructed based on what was taught. The concept map was then given to different experts for validation of the content before the analysis. Quantitative analysis using the constructs of correctness, connectedness and complexity was then applied and the qualitative analysis was done based on the actual details on the map. In terms of correctness, the findings revealed that the teacher showed a good understanding of Doppler Effect. However, there were some few incorrect links that contributed to the score. There were also only four cross links made by the teacher from his teaching which affected connectedness of the map and hence his conceptual understanding of the topic.

AB  - Improving students scientific explanations is one major goal of science education. Both writing activities and concept mapping are reported as effective strategies for enhancing student learning of science. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a teaching model, named the DCI model, which integrates a Descriptive explanation writing activity, Concept mapping, and an Interpretive explanation writing activity, is introduced in a 4th grade science class to see if it would improve students' scientific explanations and understanding. A quasi-experimental design, including a non-randomized comparison group and a pre- and post-test design, was adopted for this study. An experimental group of 25 students were taught using the DCI teaching model, while a comparison group received a traditional lecture teaching. A rubric and content analysis was used to assess students' scientific explanations. The independent sample t test was used to measure difference in conceptual understanding between the two groups, before and after instruction. Then, the paired t test analysis was used to understand the promotion of the DCI teaching model. The results showed that students in the experimental group performed better than students in the comparison group, both in scientific concept understanding and explanation. Suggestions for using concept mapping and writing activities (the DCI teaching model) in science classes are provided in this study. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers' convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students' vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers' use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - To understand genetics, students need to be able to explain and draw connections between a large number of concepts. The purpose of the study reported herein was to explore the way upper secondary science students reason about concepts in molecular genetics in order to understand protein synthesis. Data were collected by group interviews. Concept maps were constructed using the interview transcripts, and analysed. The most central concept was DNA, which served as a link between the concepts of genes and proteins. Students spontaneously introduced concepts from classical genetics to explain molecular genetics. The concept maps generated from the different group interviews were similar in that various concepts consistently appeared within specific sub-groups of interconnected concepts, ie clusters. Five main clusters were identified. The students were better able to relate between concepts within a cluster than between concepts in different clusters. The clusters can be seen as representations of the students knowledge structures, and could be used as starting points in teaching genetics. We recommend that courses in genetics should begin by focusing on students existing connections between concepts from different clusters and then point out concepts that feature in two or more clusters such as DNA, gene, and protein. © 2013 Copyright Society of Biology.

AB  - Visualization of textual data may reveal interesting properties regarding the information conveyed in a collection of documents. In this paper, we study whether the structure revealed by a visualization method can be used as features for improved classifiers. In particular, we study whether the locations of news items in a so-called concept map could be used as features for improving the prediction of stock price movements from news. We propose an approach based on information visualization and text classification for achieving this. We apply the proposed approach to the prediction of the stock price movements of companies within the oil and natural gas sector. In a case study, we show that our proposed approach performs better than a naive approach and a bag-of-words approach that does not make use of feature extraction. © 2013 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Public appreciation and basic understanding of the role the ocean plays in the global environment has become more important as the urgency to make decisions on complex environmental issues has increased. Because communicating science to the public is often challenging for scientists, they can benefit from employing methods such as concept mapping, which "deconstructs" science into discrete ideas and organizes them into graphical formats. Responding to recommendations by ocean science faculty who participated in concept-mapping workshops with pre-college educators, four Centers for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence designed, implemented, and evaluated a series of professional development workshops for graduate students. These workshops engaged 20 faculty-level ocean scientists to help 73 graduate students depict complex scientific ideas using concept maps. Evidence shows that operationally breaking down topics and reorganizing them into graphical formats benefited faculty and graduate students alike. Each workshop culminated with the graduate students delivering oral presentations to nonscientist audiences such as high school students. Graduate students were highly rated on their abilities to place topics within a broad societal context. In a follow-up survey, graduate students recognized the potential of concept mapping to enhance their professional skills and to organize their own research. © 2013 by The Oceanography Society.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to explore that using creative problem solving can promote students' performance of concept mapping (CMPING). Students were encouraged to use creative problem solving (CPS) in constructing nanometer knowledge structure, and then to promote the performance of CMPING. The knowledge structure was visualized through CMPING which helps students to improve their performance. The participants were 42 college juniors who selected the course "Nano-environmental Engineering Technology". Four instruments were used to classify student learning performance (meaningful learning, rote learning and non-learning). This study included three main issues: (1) Student learning quality was determined by the change in concept map construction. (2) In-depth interviews were applied to understand student's CPS process. (3) Student interaction quality in a discussion board on a web-platform was evaluated. The results showed that meaningful high-level learners successfully applied CPS in constructing concept maps and they presented better performance of CMPING. Rote learners' results were in the second place, and non-learners achieved the worse outcomes. It is suggested that a future teaching study can use creative problem solving to promote students' performance of CMPING in other courses. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.

AB  - Concept map is a tool for representing knowledge. They have been used in many different fields, including knowledge management, business and industrial design. Concept maps also have been used as an effective learning tool to help students integrate new concepts into their existing set of knowledge. In this study we propose a concept map construction and rule-based evaluation system that is being deployed on the web. After students learned course content to construct individual concept maps for a particular topic that was presented in a course, they can then use the rule-based evaluation system to grade their concept maps against the concept map created by the course instructor. They are also useful for evaluating student learning and helping to illuminate where learning has mastered and where invalid or incomplete ideas are held by the student. © 2013 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Chemistry courses remain a challenge for many undergraduate students. In particular, first-semester organic chemistry has been labeled as a gatekeeper with high attrition rates, especially among students of color. Our study examines a key factor related to conceptual understanding in science and predictive of course outcomes - knowledge structures. Previous research on knowledge structures has focused on differences between experts and novices. Given the increasing ethnic diversity of college classrooms and research indicating unique differences in certain higher order cognitive processes associated cultural practices and ethnicity, it is important to investigate whether similar patterns exist with respect to knowledge structures. Our study utilized concept maps to measure knowledge structures. Two separate analyses where performed to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students' organize their knowledge of organic chemistry content in structurally different ways. The first analysis utilized concept map proposition scoring to examine the influence of prior science achievement and ethnicity on knowledge structures. The second analysis examined holistic map structures to determine whether or not ethnically diverse students show qualitatively distinct structures overall. Results show significant mean differences on concept map proposition scores related to both prior science achievement and ethnic group membership. However, examination of holistic structures revealed that students' qualitative holistic structures did not vary by ethnic group membership. Taken together, our findings suggest that variation in students' knowledge structures are related to prior science achievement across ethnic groups, not qualitative differences in the ways ethnically diverse students' structure knowledge. Implications for teaching and learning in organic chemistry are discussed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Objectives To systematically evaluate the use of Framingham Risk Score (FRS) in the medical literature and specifically examine the use of FRS in different populations and settings and for different outcomes than the ones originally developed for. Study Design and Setting We identified all the citations to the article by Wilson et al. (1998), in which FRS was originally described through ISI Web of Science until April 2011. We selected studies that stated in their abstract that they calculated or used the FRS for any reason and extracted information on publication date, population studied, outcome, or disease risk factor with which FRS was associated and study design. Results We identified 375 eligible articles corresponding to 471 analyses using the FRS in cohort (n = 141), case-control (n = 16), or cross-sectional (n = 314) settings. Only a minority of the cohort studies had as a primary aim to externally validate the FRS (n = 45). The studied population was different (from general or healthy) in 35 (25%) and 133 (42%) of the cohort and cross-sectional analyses, respectively. All case-control studies examined healthy controls. The studied outcome was different (from coronary heart disease) in 79 (56%) of the cohort analyses and 10 (63%) of the case-control studies. Overall, only 46 (33%) of the 141 cohort analyses examined the same outcome and population as FRS was originally developed for. Conclusion A large number of studies use FRS in populations and for outcomes other than the ones it has been developed for and therefore for which its performance is unknown and nonvalidated. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Background: Nursing education encounter many challenges and continuously attempt to improve teaching and learning strategies in theory and practice. With the advanced clinical practice and complexity of students' assessment, nursing students who are the future nurses needs to improve their critical thinking and problem solving skills. The role of nurse educators is to develop critical thinking abilities of students through engaging students in active learning and move from the traditional linear way of thinking. Concept mapping (CM) is one strategy that makes learning meaningful. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of concept mapping as a learning strategy on developing care plan for adult 2 clinical course. Students' attitude and satisfaction toward using CM in clinical nursing education were also assessed. Method: Eighteen students enrolled in adult 2 course at College of Nursing, King Saud Bin Abdul Aziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, KSA were included in the study. A quasi experimental design, pre and post test with a control group was utilized. The questionnaire developed to measure students' knowledge and attitude toward using CM. A modified version of the satisfaction questionnaire was used to measure the students' satisfaction with CM. Evaluation of submitted CMs was done to assess effectiveness of using CM in developing care plan for adult 2 clinical course. Results: Results indicated that students' knowledge about CM was improved in the post test. Students reported a positive attitude toward using CM in nursing courses. The mean score for the set of CMs developed by the students at the end of the course was higher. CMs developed at the end of the course were more comprehensive and creative. In addition, students showed high satisfaction with using CM strategy in nursing education. Conclusion and Recommendation: Nursing education requires understanding and should not based on memorization. Concept mapping can enhance students' creative, logical, and critical thinking which improve independent learning. Adopting CM in all nursing courses and non nursing courses were recommended.

AB  - Introduction Translating government-funded cancer research into clinical practice can be accomplished via virtual communities of practice that include key players in the process: Researchers, health care practitioners, and intermediaries. This study, conducted from November 2012 through January 2013, examined issues that key stakeholders believed should be addressed to create and sustain government-sponsored virtual communities of practice to integrate cancer control research, practice, and policy and demonstrates howconcept mapping can be used to present relevant issues. Methods Key stakeholders brainstormed statements describingwhat is needed to create and sustain virtual communities of practice for moving cancer control research into practice. Participants rated them on importance and feasibility, selected most relevant statements, and sorted them into clusters. I used concept mapping to examine the issues identified and multidimensional scaling analyses tocreate a 2-dimensional conceptual map of the statement clusters. Results Participants selected 70 statements and sorted theminto 9 major clusters related to creating and sustaining virtual communities of practice: 1) standardization of best practices, 2) external validity, 3) funding and resources, 4) social learning and collaboration, 5) cooperation, 6) partnerships, 7) inclusiveness, 8) social determinants and cultural competency, and 9) preparing the environment. Researchers, health care practitioners, and intermediaries were in relative agreement regarding issues of importance for creating these communities. Conclusion Virtual communities of practice can be created to address the needs of researchers, health care practitioners, and intermediaries by using input from these key stakeholders. Increasing linkages between these subgroupscan improve the translation of research into practice. Similarities and differences between groups can provide valuable information to assist the government in developing virtual communities of practice.

AB  - We evaluate a new approach to teaching the basic biochemistry mechanisms that regulate the biology of Triatominae, major vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. We have designed and used a comic book, "Carlos Chagas: 100 years after a hero's discovery" containing scientific information obtained by seven distinguished contemporary Brazilian researchers working with Triatominaes. Students (22) in the seventh grade of a public elementary school received the comic book. The study was then followed up by the use of Concept Maps elaborated by the students. Six Concept Maps elaborated by the students before the introduction of the comic book received an average score of 7. Scores rose to an average of 45 after the introduction of the comic book. This result suggests that a more attractive content can greatly improve the knowledge and conceptual understanding among students not previously exposed to insect biochemistry. In conclusion, this study illustrates an alternative to current strategies of teaching about the transmission of neglected diseases. It also promotes the diffusion of the scientific knowledge produced by Brazilian researchers that may stimulate students to choose a scientific career. © 2014 The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB  - Knowledge Assessment is an important part of the learning process as it allows the learner to keep track of their progress in the knowledge acquisition process. There are several types of assessment techniques. Among them, we find questions with short and open answers (SOA Questions). The evaluation of these questions with open and short answers, where the learner has to develop a response going of some words to 5 lines, constitutes a type of complex assessment technique. This paper presents a novel approach regarding knowledge assessment of SOA questions using concept maps. We propose a scenario for using this type of questions in online learning environments and describe our approach for automatically evaluating this type of questions using concept maps and similarities measures. © 2013 IEEE.

AB  - Background: Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Methods: Participants were first year medical students (n=150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Results: Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, p<0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). Conclusion: The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry. © 2013 Krishna M.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use a comparative approach to scrutinize the common assumption that certain school science activities are theoretical and therefore particularly suited for engaging students with scientific ideas, whereas others are practical and, thus, not equally conducive to engagement with scientific ideas. We compared two school science activities, one (laboratory work) that is commonly regarded as focusing attention on artefacts that may distract students from central science concepts and the other (concept mapping) that is thought to make students focus directly on these concepts. We observed students in either a laboratory activity about real galvanic cells or a concept-mapping activity about idealized galvanic cells. We used a practical epistemology analysis to compare the two activities regarding students' actions towards scientific ideas and artefacts. The comparison revealed that the two activities, despite their alleged differences along the theory-practice scale, primarily resulted in similar student actions. For instance, in both activities, students interacted extensively with artefacts and, to a lesser extent, with scientific ideas. However, only occasionally did students establish any explicit continuity between artefacts and scientific ideas. The findings indicate that some of the problems commonly considered to be unique for school science practical work may indeed be a feature of school science activities more generally. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - In an attempt to reveal potential threshold concepts in the field of higher education pedagogy, groups of university teachers (in the UK and in Panama) were encouraged to develop personal reflection upon their conceptions of teaching. This was initiated through concept mapping activities. It was hoped that this would help participants to address the perceived differences of teaching between their disciplines whilst coming to recognise the generic factors that may be applicable to teaching across the university context. Consideration of emergent personal models allowed the authors to identify common themes across the disciplines and to align this to established learning theories that may act as a baseline for comparison. The emergent generic model was a modification of Kolb's learning cycle in which two learning cycles (one for the student and one for the teacher) are linked by the shared concrete experience of the classroom and considered in the context of knowledge structures. The transformation of the morphology of these knowledge structures (oscillating between linear and hierarchical) is seen as fundamental to the successful negotiation of the cycle. The participants' recognition of this structural transformation is proposed as a threshold concept for the evolution of university teaching. Personal models are described here in relation to the double Kolb cycle to illustrate the potential of this approach to stimulate discussion about university teaching that may encourage a transformation in perspective from delivery and receipt of content towards structural transformation of content. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - New networking technologies increase the effectiveness and the adoption of interactive tools in all education levels. Concept maps are one of the most important of these interactive tools. They have been widely used as learning and teaching tools in science education. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of web-supported concept maps (WSCMs) and classical concept maps (CCMs) on students' cognitive development and misconception changes about photosynthesis subject. The sample of this study consists of total 74 students and 2 experienced teachers in Trabzon. CCMs were transferred to the virtual environments in the form of WSCMs by authors. At the beginning, Photosynthesis achievement tests (PAT) and photosynthesis concept test (PCT) were administered as pre-tests and post-tests both to experimental group and control group. After the educational program, general science achievement on PAT increased by 10 % in favor of experimental group (EG) at significant level (p<0.05). Although the increased at knowledge level in cognitive development was 16.00 % in the EG and 16.80 % in control group (CG). These changes were 26.60 % and 18.90 % at comprehension and application levels in the EG and 10.54 %15.50 % in the CG for cognitive development, respectively. The results revealed that using WSCMs in teaching photosynthesis is very effective for students to reach comprehension level of cognitive domain. In addition, misconceptions about food, nutrition and energy sources for plants were decreased in the EG more than in the CG. © Sila Science.

AB  - The purpose of this research is threefold: (1) to identify the difficulties that Grade 10 students in a Lebanese school have that hinder their conceptual understanding at the micro-macro-symbolic interface in chemistry, (2) to investigate the effect of a macro-micro-symbolic teaching approach on students' relational understanding of chemical reactions, and (3) to characterize students' conceptual profiles regarding their understanding of chemical reactions in terms of macro, micro, symbolic levels and the relations among them, at the end of the teaching sequence. Forty six 10th graders from two sections participated in the study. A student-centered approach was followed in both sections based on constructivist pedagogy. Hence the teacher played the role of a facilitator who guided students in a meaning making inductive learning process, through questioning, monitoring, validating, and clarifying ideas. Instruction in the experimental group was characterized by macro-micro-symbolic teaching that focuses on the interplay between the levels, integrates various representations, and engages students in an epistemic discourse about the nature of knowing in chemistry. Data sources for the study included a pre-test and two post-intervention tasks: a post-test and a concept map task, in addition to interviews with selected students from both sections. Findings indicated that macro-micro-symbolic teaching enhanced students' conceptual understanding and relational learning of chemical reactions. Besides, four assertions related to students' conceptual and epistemological thinking in response to the different teaching approaches are presented. Implications for instruction and for teacher education programs, as well as recommendations for further research, are discussed in light of these findings. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Research has identified the value of students constructing their own representations of science concepts using modes such as writing, diagrams, 2-D and 3-D models, images or speech to communicate meaning. "Slowmation" (abbreviated from "Slow Animation") is a simplified way for students, such as preservice teachers, to make a narrated animation using a combination of modes. In this study, 13 preservice primary teachers learned how to create a slowmation during a two-hour class in a science methods course and then created one about an allocated science topic as an assignment. The research question that guided this study was, "What are the preservice teachers' perceptions of making a slowmation and how was the science concept represented in the animation?" Data included pre and post individual interviews, concept maps constructed during the interviews and the animations as artifacts. Three case studies provide a window into the perceptions of preservice teachers making a slowmation and show how they represented their concept. Slowmation is a new form of student-generated representation which enables them to use their own technology to construct a narrated animation as a multimodal representation to explain a science concept. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Mobile and wireless communication technologies not only enable anytime and anywhere learning, but also provide the opportunity to develop learning environments that combine real-world and digital-world resources. Nevertheless, researchers have indicated that, without effective tools for helping students organize their observations in the field, the mobile learning performance could be disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes an interactive concept map-oriented approach for supporting mobile learning activities. An experiment has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The experimental results show that the proposed approach not only enhances learning attitudes, but also improves the learning achievements of the students. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Developing requirements for software projects require shared understanding of requirements among all the team members. But in Global Software Development (GSD) this shared understanding becomes harder to achieve because of the challenges inherited in GSD; these challenges include cultural diversity, inadequate communication, Time Zone difference and improper knowledge management. By its very nature, software development consists of many knowledge management practices. One of the important needs is to study the impact of these practices on shared understanding of requirements in GSD. During three months controlled experiment in an academic setting with two groups of geographically distributed students; we studied the impact of "clear organizational structure with communicating responsibilities" a practice of Knowledge Management on shared understanding of requirements. We observed the understanding patterns of both teams by conducting multiple concept mapping exercises. This paper presents comparison of results obtained from concept mapping exercises of both development teams. These results demonstrate that how selected knowledge management practice helps to improve shared understanding of requirements among GSD team members. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - In order to better understand the structure of students' knowledge in computer science, we are trying to identify patterns - in form of frequently occurring subgraphs - in concept maps. Concept maps are an externalization of a person's declarative knowledge represented as a graph. We propose an algorithm that can be employed to identify frequently occurring subgraphs, based on existing algorithms in that field. We are currently working on a project that will gather concept maps form a large group of freshman in the coming semesters, providing us with extensive material for information mining about the structures of knowledge in CS. We hope to get a better understanding of the relationship between knowledge and competence.

AB  - Printed books have long been an important means for people to obtain knowledge; nevertheless, educators have pointed out problems of learning from some printed books, in particular, the lack of learning supports, such as supplementary materials and learning guiding tools. In this study, a concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is proposed for supporting printed science book reading activities for children via mobile devices with QR-code facilities. A quasi-experiment has been conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 92 sixth graders participated. The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is significantly more helpful to the students in reading printed books than traditional book reading and the conventional ubiquitous learning approach in terms of learning achievements; moreover, the students had a high level of acceptance of such a mobile technology-assisted learning system in terms of "ease of use", "usefulness" and & quotattitude and intention of future use." © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - There are numerous challenges facing a class at university: limited access to tutorial rooms, fewer tutors and low student attendance in traditional lectures. A further challenge in science is the need to facilitate the learning—and develop the science literacy—of non-science majors, who in the case of this paper elect to study astronomy as part of their academic program. On moving a class online, the challenge includes finding, and becoming confident in using, effective methods and tools. This paper traces a process of review and collaboration between an educational development team and faculty academics to reconfigure an introductory astronomy unit. Part of the approach is to engage students using concept mapping to underpin enquiry-driven pedagogy using the university’s learning management system. © 2012 Natalie Spence, Dean Groom, Orsola de Marco, Robert Parker, Michael Ireland, Mark Wardle.

AB  - In this study we constructed rules to systematically identify the differences as well as similarity in partonomy between two large biomedical ontologies. For a group of one-to-one mapped concepts, we distinguish among different types of parts defined for these mapped concepts, and the structural imbalance between two systems. As a result, 1.4% of the concept mappings have exactly the same part-whole relations, 68.4% do not have any parts, and 30.2% mappings are modeled differently, including additional parts, more detailed part paths, and different intermediate concepts in the part paths. This is a parallel study to our previous work where granularity mismatches in is-a classification among ontologies were identified. Using rules and the rule inference engine enables an automatic and scalable investigation of the structural incompatibility among biomedical ontologies. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - Observation competence plays a fundamental role in outdoor scientific investigation. The computerized concept mapping technique as a Mindtool has shown the potential for enhancing meaningful learning in science education. The purposes of the present study are to develop a concept map integrated mobile learning design for ecology observation and to examine the implementation effect for elementary school children. Also, the difference in growth slopes between gifted and average students is investigated. Eighteen gifted students and thirty average students were included in this study. A computerized dynamic assessment system which combines a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) and a concept map integrated ecology observation learning design were implemented. The results of the hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis reveal that the overall growth slope is significant (μ=0.27, p<.01). The effect size is 0.53. The growth slope of the gifted students is a little higher than that of the average students. However, the slope difference between ability groups is not significant. The results suggest that a well designed concept map integrated learning system demonstrates very promising potential for enhancing both the gifted and average students' mobile observation competence. The system developed in this study could be a useful resource for elementary school outdoor learning design. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - This study explores the effect of multidimensional concept mapping instruction on students' learning performance in a web-based computer course. The subjects consisted of 103 fourth graders from an elementary school in central Taiwan. They were divided into three groups: multidimensional concept map (MCM) instruction group, Novak concept map (NCM) instruction group, and traditional textbook (TT) instruction group. Four weeks of experimental instructions were given to the three groups, respectively. Students' progresses were examined by pre-test and post-test measurements. The experimental results suggested that subjects in the MCM group performed significantly better than those in the NCM group which in turn performed significantly better than those in the TT group. Pedagogical implications were addressed, and conclusion and some suggestions were given. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Most students think animals are more interesting than plants as a study topic believing that plants are inferior to animals because they are passive and unable to respond to external challenges, particularly biological invaders such as microorganisms and insect herbivores. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit, the Fighting Plant Learning Unit (FPLU), which focuses on plant defense responses to biological stimuli. The study also investigated students' perceptions of the FPLU implemented in a constructivist classroom. A total of 31 Thai science majors from grade 12 participated in this study. Multiple data-gathering techniques (quantitative and qualitative) were employed: conceptual testing, concept mapping, the Constructivist Learning Environment Survey questionnaire and semi-structured interviews. It was found that from their active participation, the students developed a better conceptual understanding of plant defense mechanisms. In addition, they appeared to have positive attitudes toward the FPLU as evidenced by their preference for inquiry-based teaching in a constructivist learning environment. Finally, their perspectives on and appreciation of plants as active organisms had been favorably changed by the experience. © 2011 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - The PISA 2000 study found large differences between countries in terms of quality of learning. In some countries, students prefer rote learning to meaningful learning. However, such memorisation of the material does not lead to recallable and usable knowledge in the long run. Ausubel's (1968) wellknown theory serves as a basis for several techniques of meaningful learning, including concept mapping, which emphasises the visual organization of comprehended information. The present study reports the results of an experiment using concept mapping for deepening students' understanding of teaching materials. It focuses on definitions frequently used in science and Hungarian grammar lessons. Results indicate that concept mapping training programmes can improve participants' achievement. Experiences show that the technique of concept mapping is frequently unfamiliar to students. More time would be needed for practising and using it in different learning situations. © IEJEE.

AB  - Concept maps are frequently used in K-12 educational settings. The purpose of this study is to determine whether students' performance on interactive concept map tasks in Guru, an intelligent tutoring system, is related to immediate and delayed learning outcomes. Guru is a dialogue-based system for high-school biology that intersperses concept map tasks within the tutorial dialogue. Results indicated that when students first attempt to complete concept maps, time spent on the maps may be a good indicator of their understanding, whereas the errors they make on their second attempts with the maps may be an indicator of the knowledge they are lacking. This pattern of results was observed for one cycle of testing, but not replicated in a second cycle. Differences in the findings for the two testing cycles are most likely due to topic variations.

AB  - Web-based hypermedia learning environments are widely used in modern education and seem particularly well suited for interdisciplinary learning. Previous work has identified guidance through these complex environments as a crucial problem of their acceptance and efficiency. We reasoned that map-based navigation might provide straightforward and effortless orientation. To achieve this, we developed a clickable and user-oriented concept map-based navigation plugin. This tool is implemented as an extension of Moodle, a widely used learning management system. It visualizes inner and interdisciplinary relations between learning objects and is generated dynamically depending on user set parameters and interactions. This plugin leaves the choice of navigation type to the user and supports direct guidance. Previously developed and evaluated face-to-face interdisciplinary learning materials bridging physiology and physics courses of a medical curriculum were integrated as learning objects, the relations of which were defined by metadata. Learning objects included text pages, self-assessments, videos, animations, and simulations. In a field study, we analyzed the effects of this learning environment on physiology and physics knowledge as well as the transfer ability of third-term medical students. Data were generated from pre-and posttest questionnaires and from tracking studentnavigation. Use of the hypermedia environment resulted in a significant increase of knowledge and transfer capability. Furthermore, the efficiency of learning was enhanced. We conclude that hypermedia environments based on Moodle and enriched by concept map-based navigation tools can significantly support interdisciplinary learning. Implementation of adaptivity may further strengthen this approach. © 2012 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - The Web is now a standard tool for information access and dissemination in higher education. The prospect of Web-based, simulated learning platforms and technologies, however, remains underexplored. We have developed a Web-based tutorial program (ChemVoyage) for a third-year organic chemistry class on the topic of pericyclic reactions to illustrate this approach with scaffolding and visual auxiliaries. The questions in the tutorial are tiered to simulate the pyramidal structure of knowledge and interlinked to form concept maps required to aid student learning. Visual cues and remedial exercises are linked to advanced questions to facilitate integration of knowledge. Students advance through lower levels to reach higher levels at their own pace. This Web-based learning program provides flexible delivery for the learner and records the learning history of an individual user for the instructor. The diagnostic information helps with reflective teaching and facilitates independence of the learner. Student feedback shows that this is an effective approach in improving their learning outcomes. © 2012 The American Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

AB  - Research apprenticeships for secondary students provide authentic contexts for learning science in which students engage in scientific investigations with practicing scientists in working laboratory groups. Student experiences in these research apprenticeships vary depending on the individual nature of the laboratory in which students have been placed. This study explores potential relationships among student experiences in apprenticeship contexts and desired student outcomes (e. g. science content knowledge, understandings of nature of science, and aspirations for science oriented career plans). The following two research questions guided the study: How do participant experiences in and outcomes resulting from an authentic research program for high school students vary? How does variation in participant experiences in an authentic research program relate to participant outcomes? Primary data sources were student and mentor interviews in addition to student generated concept maps. Results indicated that the greatest variance in student experiences existed in the categories of collaboration, epistemic involvement, and understandings of the significance of research results. The greatest variation in desired student outcomes was observed in student understandings of nature of science and in students' future science plans. Results suggested that collaboration and interest in the project were experience aspects most likely to be related to desired outcomes. Implications for the design of research apprenticeships for secondary students are discussed. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Every human being should possess problem solving skills in order to reach one's desired goals in life. Problem solving skills become even more important when sustainable solutions are desperately needed to cope with twin problems of growing scarcity of resources and increasing populations. Practical problem solving skills, with clear economically viable, timely and implementable solutions are highly valued. Unfortunately the traditional curricula of most Universities, does not teach these skills up to the level which is desired by employers. The immediate and short term purpose of this research is to study and improve the problem solving skills of undergrad Computer Science (CS) students. In this paper, the long term objective is to learn the tools and techniques by which it can be achieved and then employ those in other disciplines also. The paper highlights three main folds of the research areas, firstly problem solving skills play a significant role in technical capabilities of people in general but more so for students studying in applied science and engineering areas, such as CS, secondly, problem solving skills can be "measured" and thirdly, problem solving skills can be improved with exercising and training. © IDOSI Publications, 2012.

AB  - Concept maps have become a widely used educational tool around the globe. The advancements in computerized interface technologies have enabled even more alternatives for using concept maps in teaching and learning. This study investigates the effects of two different touch technology-based concept mapping interaction modes on students' learning achievements and learning attitudes in a natural science course, as well as their degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn. Ninety two sixth graders were randomly divided into three groups. Experimental Group One was taught using the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB)-based concept mapping approach, Experimental Group Two learned with the touchscreen-based concept mapping approach, while the control group learned with the traditional paper-and-pencil-based concept mapping approach. The experimental results show that, in terms of learning attitudes toward the natural science course and the degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn, the students were significantly more positive about the two touch technology-based interaction modes than they were about the traditional paper-and-pencil mode. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - Qualitative research methodologies were used in this research to find the misconceptions of secondary school students about the electric current. Data were collected through the Elektricity Concept Test with a three tier test, concept mapping activity sheet and electric-related concepts analogy sheet. A total of 97 students from three different secondary schools participated in the study. The research concluded that students had misconceptions about some concepts related to the electric current such as current, resistance, potential difference, generator/ battery and simple electric circuit. The misconception that students have about electric current as "The current is stored in the generator/battery" was indicated through the Elektricity Concept Test, concept maps and analogies. In the light of this research study, it is suggested that in addition to concept tests, concept maps and analogies can be used in determining misconceptions.

AB  - Formal cross-sector research networks in Canada face enormous organizational challenges to attain the goals of enhancing the economic and social relevance of science, attracting and retaining world-class researchers, fostering innovation, and improving science communication between societal sectors. This paper presents the results of an exploratory concept mapping policy Delphi exercise that aimed to map the essential characteristics of an ideal cross-sector research network in the natural resource sector. The results suggest that the most important and feasible design features for a future research network are the scope of research, knowledge management and knowledge exchange, which relate to three critical functions of research networks: knowledge production, coordination, and translation. The results also suggest that a future research network should involve all stakeholders affected by, and affecting, natural resource management and that the network be flexible and responsive to various stakeholders' research needs. © The Author 2012.

AB  - The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) promises to reshape the way ocean science is conducted by providing ocean researchers with access to near real-time data, the ability to control/configure sensors and mobile assets, high-bandwidth infrastructure for images, powerful cyberinfrastructure, and data visualization and modeling tools to conduct their research. Recent advances in the delivery of web-based education, and the use of visualization technology in educational contexts, have led to the development of on-line platforms for instruction that engage students in active scientific inquiry by collecting and analyzing real world data. The OOI Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization will leverage these technologies for ocean education. EPE will construct a series of software tools and a web-based social network that leverages the OOI Cyberinfrastructure to support engagement of a wide range of users. These tools will enable educators and developers to enhance their undergraduate education programs and engage free choice learners using real-time and streaming data provided by the OOI. EPE will enable a new approach to oceanography research, where scientists, students and the public can explore and research the ocean in real-time from their classrooms, offices, dorm rooms, and even their homes. The face of an oceanographer will be expanded well beyond the professor at sea to to a student at home viewing and analyzing exactly the same data at exactly the same time. In addition to the OOI EPE Implementing Organization (IO), there are additional IOs supporting the OOI construction (Figure 1): Regional Scale Nodes (RSN): RSN will deploy sensors to study Hydrate Ridge, an area of massive sub-seafloor gashydrate deposits, and Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano. Coastal and Global Scale Nodes (CGSN): CGSN will deploy a global array of moorings and underwater gliders to provide sustained, but adaptable, access to complex coastal and global systems. Cyberinfrastructure (CI): The CI will provide a common operating infrastructure connecting and coordinating the operations of the marine components with the OOI scientific and educational pursuits. Program Management Office (PMO): The OOI program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and managed by the OOI PMO, located at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) offices in Washington, D.C. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The aim of this study was to compare the learning achievement of students who prepared the opposition to be teachers in Secondary Education in the speciality of Physical Education, after receiving training in different thematic areas of anatomy and physiology through different teaching and learning methods: concept mapping (CMaps), problem-based learning (PBL) and combined use of both methods. Methodology: We used a quasi-experimental, descriptive and sectional methodological design. The total sample consisted of 180 students, 95 males and 85 females. We worked with a group of 64 people who received training through CMaps, another 61 students who received training PBL, and a third group of 55 which works by combining both methods. The measuring instrument was a questionnaire type assessment test for each content block. Pretest measure was obtained before training and other measures after the intervention (posttest). Improvements were analyzed in each group according to the method of teaching applied and compared the results obtained by analysis of gain scores (posttest-pretest) with T-test for related samples. Results: After intervention the mean score is above eighty percent in the five blocks analyzed, with the physiology and anatomy in the most evolved. PBL has proven more effective than CMaps, but the highest improvements, compared to pretest, are in the group that has studied combining CMaps + PBL. The results were discussed, in agreement with other authors, the need to consider greater use of PBL as a method of teaching and learning and using a mixed methodological approach students acquire greater skills and competencies.

AB  - This study deals with the application of constructivist approach through individual and cooperative modes of spider and hierarchical concept maps to achieve meaningful learning on science concepts (e.g. acids, bases & salts, physical and chemical changes)). The main research questions were: Q (1): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of spider concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (2): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of hierarchical concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (3): out of spider and hierarchical maps, which one is more effective to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (4): is this concept map is being applicable for constructivist approach? Sixty-four 7th grade students from an Indian elementary school participated in the study. Thirty-four and thirty participants treated through spider and hierarchical concept map approach with both cooperative and individual modes. It was an immediate and delayed test experimental design. Two teaching approaches used for two experimental groups: one based upon spider concept map approach and other was hierarchical map approach. After all, students' immediate and delayed, cooperative and individual map of both groups were scored and analyzed by using, Jena & Panda, 2009 scoring procedure. The parametric tests, such as one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test used to identify any differences between spider and hierarchical map approach, concerning cooperative and individual modes of learning. Both cooperative spider and hierarchical concept map were significantly better than individual learning in science concept. Therefore, concept map is a constructivist learning. © 2012 HKIEd APFSLT.

AB  - 12 learners were observed, while they were reflecting collaboratively three times in regular chemistry classroom practice, supported either by the method of computer-based concept mapping or a portfolio method. Both methods serve to help students making their thinking visible and communicable. While discussing their own ideas the students use verbal communication as well as non-verbal interaction. First results indicate differences in verbal and non-verbal communication that can be traced back to the different reflection methods. © ISLS.

AB  - We present the results of an investigation on how well students are able to understand object-oriented programming (OOP) when learning with only very minimal guidance. We analyzed the source code that the students of a preparatory course produced during the course as well as concept maps that they were asked to draw before and after the course. Our findings show, that there are observable differences between what students know about some concepts and what they're able to do with it. Generally speaking, it seems that several OOP related concepts can be applied successfully without fully understanding the underlying concepts, while others are hard to understand and apply without a significant amount of prior knowledge. This gives rise to the suspicion that it might be possible to apply a concept without having understood it, at least with respect to some algorithmic concepts of CS. Copyright 2012 ACM.

AB  - Physiology is often considered a challenging course for students. It is up to teachers to structure courses and create learning opportunities that will increase the chance of student success. In an undergraduate exercise physiology course, concept maps are assigned to help students actively process and organize information into manageable and meaningful chunks and to teach them to recognize the patterns and regularities of physiology. Students are first introduced to concept mapping with a commonly relatable nonphysiology concept and are then assigned a series of maps that become more and more complex. Students map the acute response to a drop in blood pressure, the causes of the acute increase in stroke volume during cardiorespiratory exercise, and the factors contributing to an increase in maximal O2 consumption with cardiorespiratory endurance training. In the process, students draw the integrative nature of physiology, identify causal relationships, and learn about general models and core principles of physiology. © 2012 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - The paper describes how specific descriptors for the Conservation-Restoration profession have been developed by the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organizations. The result of which is in accordance with the threefold rubric of Knowledge, Skills and Competence as defined by the European Qualifications Framework. Instead of giving a broad general description of level, which is insufficiently expressive, concept mapping has been used to explicitly uncover the topography of Knowledge, Skills and Competence required for access to the profession. The application of this method, originally developed by Novak in 1972 to enhance learning in the sciences, demonstrates that it is possible to elucidate the complex nature of such professions using such a declarative system. Its hierarchical nature and the ease with which links between different elements can be identified aid the construction of an intellectually robust framework, thereby demonstrating its appropriateness. The results suggest that access to the profession can be presented as a framework of interconnected cognitive competencies, which can be expressed as a structural process where each element possesses an individual level of skill and knowledge. © 2011 The Author(s).

AB  - In physics teacher education the use of graphical knowledge representation tools like concept maps are abundantly used because they are known to support the formation of organised knowledge. It is widely assumed that certain structural characteristics of concept maps can be connected to the usefulness of content. In order to study this relationship, the concept maps made by pre-service physics teachers are examined here. The design principles of the concept maps are based on quantitative experiments and modelling as the basic procedures in physics concept formation. The epistemic plausibility of justifications written in links is evaluated by using a four-level classification introduced here. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge. The advantages of such concept mapping technique in supporting the conceptual understanding in physics teacher education are discussed as well as their usefulness in making plans for teaching.

AB  - The way teachers organize and transfer their subject matter knowledge has played a crucial role in science education. However, it seems that more attention should be paid on the forms of representation and knowledge organization of teachers that they apply for transferring their knowledge. Therefore, teachers' knowledge organization and representation forms were investigated with an emphasis on the topics of Biot- Savart law and Ampère's law. Four physics teachers of introductory-level University who used, concept cards and concept maps were interviewed, and finally an interpretative analysis was performed. The results showed teachers' knowledge organization was strongly connected only for the topic of Biot-Savart law. Moreover, descriptive and explanatory mathematical models were the most applied forms of representation that teachers used for representing their knowledge. The possibility to recognize the differences in knowledge organization and representation forms of different teachers is the first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solution.

AB  - Higher professional education aims to prepare students for entering practice with an adequate theoretical body of knowledge. In constructivist programmes, authentic learning contexts and self-directed learning are assumed to support knowledge learning and the transition from education to practice. Through an in-depth exploration, this case study aimed at defining and assessing the qualities of social work students' theoretical knowledge at initial qualification. Participants were final-year bachelor's students (n = 18) in a constructivist professional programme of social work. Students' knowledge concerning a real-life practical case was elicited through an interview and a form of concept mapping. A six-step procedure was used for a qualitative appraisal of students' knowledge with the assistance of seven expert teachers. During this procedure an instrument for analysing knowledge qualities was developed, comprising 13 aspects representing four features of expert knowledge: extent, depth, structure, and critical control. Results showed that 13 students received high appraisals for their knowledge extent and depth. Only 4 students received high appraisals for knowledge structure and critical control. 5 Students who received overall lower appraisals seemed inhibited to show their knowledge qualities by preoccupations with self-concerns about their own professional role. Conclusion is that the majority of students needs more learning support for knowledge structure and critical control than offered by their constructivist programme. Further research is needed into the personal factors that influence students' theoretical knowledge learning and which knowledge qualities can be reached by young adults in a 4 year educational programme. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In recent years, e-learning has been used in a chemical engineering subject in the final course of a mining engineering degree, a subject concerned with fuel technology. The low results obtained by students in this subject have led the teacher to search for new strategies to increase grades. Such strategies have consisted of incorporating into the existing virtual environment a dynamics of work with conceptual maps and a consideration of the different learning styles in the classroom. In an attempt to adapt teaching to the individual methods of learning for each student, various activities aimed at strengthening different learning styles have been proposed and concept maps have been used to create meaningful learning experiences. In addition, different modalities of assessment have been proposed, which can be selected by each student according to his or her particular method of learning to avoid penalising one style preference in contrast to another. This combination of e-learning, use of concept maps and catering for different learning styles has involved the implementation of the improved virtual learning environment. This has led to an increase in participation in the subject and has improved student assessment results. © 2012 SEFI.

AB  - Metacognitive learning strategies are based on instructional learning theory, which promotes deep, meaningful learning. Educators in a baccalaureate-level nuclear medicine technology program demonstrated that students enrolled in an online, distance learning section of an introductory radiation protection and radiobiology course performed better when traditional instruction was supplemented with nontraditional metacognitive learning strategies. Methods: The metacognitive learning strategy that was used is best known as concept mapping. The concept map, in addition to the standard homework problem assignment and opportunity for question-answer sessions, became the template for misconception identification and remediation interactions between the instructor and the student. The control group relied on traditional homework problems and question-answer sessions alone. Because students in both the "treatment" groups (i.e., students who used concept mapping) and the control group were distance learning students, all personal communications were conducted via e-mail or telephone. The final examination of the course was used to facilitate a quantitative comparison of the performance of students who used concept mapping and the performance of students who did not use concept mapping. Results: The results demonstrated a significantly higher median final examination score for the concept mapping group than for the non-concept mapping group (z = -2.0381, P = 0.0415), with an appropriately large effect size (2.65). Conclusion: Concept mapping is a cognitive learning intervention that effectively enables meaningful learning and is suitable for use in the independent learner-oriented distance learning environments used by some nuclear medicine technology programs. © 2011 by the Society of Nuclear Medicine, Inc.

AB  - Increasingly, higher education institutions in Cuba use information and communications technology in their educational processes. Among them are the Virtual Health University, the Informatics Science University, Las Villas Central University, the Agrarian University of Havana, Havana University and others, who have opted for the use of Learning Object technology to achieve reusability, accessibility, durability and interoperability in the resources education. The objective of this research is to develop a work environment called AT-CRODA contributing to the collaborative creation of Learning Objects. AT-CRODA is characterized by the development of knowledge management, the use of Web 2.0 tools, and the use of mind and concept maps and the use of a web authoring tool. The environment was evaluated from an expert Delphi method and obtained the result of "very adequate". The use of this work environment in higher education institutions promote collaborative creation of reusable, accessible, durable and interoperable resources, thus contributing to the quality of teaching-learning process.

AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the results of a survey on students regarding the integration of their institution's health science curriculum. Methods: One hundred and twenty five (125) students of the 5th term of the undergraduate medical course were given a questionnaire on the integration sessions. The questionnaire with a five point Likert scale, with a minimum of one and a maximum of five rating, was administered in October 2009. The data from the questionnaire was compiled and analyzed by using the SPSS version 16. Results: One hundred and twenty two students out of the one hundred and twenty five answered the questionnaire 122/125 (97.6%). The reliability of the scale was 0.50 (Cronbachs alpha -0.5). 91.8% students agreed that integrated teaching helped in the appreciation and application of the basic science knowledge to health and disease. 82% agreed that integrated teaching improved the performance in clinics and university examinations. The responses were equally distributed in favour of traditional teaching (36%) and integrated teaching (30.3%), while 33.6% responses were of indecisisive. 51.7% of the students preferred the horizontal to vertical integrated teaching. Many positive aspects were listed by the students, such as "integrated teaching improves the understanding of the topics" and a few negative remarks such as "lengthy" were mentioned. The students suggested mind mapping, concept maps and small group discussions to improve the interaction. Conclusion: The students recognized that integrating the medical subjects was useful and of interest to them, and that they should be continued.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that represents knowledge in graphs. It has been widely adopted in science education and cognitive psychology to aid learning and assessment. To realize the sequential manner in which students develop concept maps, most research relies upon human-dependent, qualitative approaches. This article proposes a method for sequential pattern analysis, inspired by sequential pattern mining algorithms generally applied to commercial forecast and decision supports. The method can be programmed for automatic execution and thus reasonably fast, yielding reproducible results. To validate the proposed method, 187 college students were recruited to create respective concept maps on a computerized concept mapping system. While the concept mapping data was analyzed by the sequential pattern analysis method, it was found that the mapping sequences used by students that created superior concept maps were similar and had a pattern in which propositions were formed in a temporal order from more inclusive to less inclusive. Conversely, no similarity was found in the concept mapping sequences by those who created inferior concept maps. The findings support theoretical expectations about concept mapping and are consistent with qualitative evidence based on student self-reports. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology.

AB  - Background: Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is an interactive, case-based conference for medical students designed to: (1) integrate preclinical and clinical learning; (2) promote inductive clinical reasoning; and (3) emphasise students as peer teachers. CPGR specifically encourages mixed learning level student interactions and emphasises the use of concept mapping. We describe the theoretical basis and logistical considerations for an interactive, integrative, mixed-learner environment such as CPGR. In addition, we report qualitative data regarding students' attitudes towards and perceptions of CPGR. Context: Medical students from first to fourth year participate in a monthly, interactive conference. Programme description: The CPGR was designed to bridge gaps and reinforce linkages between basic science and clinical concepts, and to incorporate interactive vertical integration between preclinical and clinical students. Medical education and content experts use Socratic, interactive teaching methods to develop real-time concept maps to emphasise the presence and importance of linkages across curricula. Programme evaluation: Student focus groups were held to assess attitudes towards and perceptions of the mixed-learner environment and concept maps in CPGR. Qualitative analyses of focus group transcripts were performed to develop themes and codes describing the students' impressions of CPGR. Discussion: CPGR is a case-based, interactive conference designed to help students gain an increased appreciation of linkages between basic science and clinical medicine concepts, and an increased awareness of clinical reasoning thought processes. Success is dependent upon explicit attention being given to goals for students' integrated learning. © Blackwell Publishing Ltd 2013.

AB  - The current global climate change has increased the importance of environmental education substantially. Adolescents are known to have common concepts about global change that are often fragmentary or incorrect. Reinfried et al. (Geographie heute 265:24–33, 2008) suggest special learning materials by facing students with their own conceptions and confronting them with the correct ones. In our two-day environmental education programme, combining indoor and outdoor activities in an ecological botanical garden, we implemented specially designed materials to confront students with a common misconception about the relationship of ozone layer depletion with the greenhouse effect. Other common misconceptions about global climate change and the greenhouse effect were not explicitly mentioned in the learning material. We used concept mapping as a method to reveal conceptions and potential conceptual changes. 25 high-achieving high-school students have taken part in our study so far. Initial results show that conceptions of our participants were quite in line with the literature. We also showed that presentation of information does indeed play an important role in changing students’ conceptions. Therefore, not only providing the necessary information but also confronting misconceptions should be part of any educational material. © 2012, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Program comprehension is an integral part of the evolution and maintenance of large software systems. As it is increasingly difficult to comprehend these systems completely, programmers have to rely on a partial and as-needed comprehension. We study partial comprehension and programmer learning with the use of concept maps as a tool for capturing programmer knowledge during concept location, which is one of the tasks of software evolution and maintenance, and it is a prerequisite of a software change. We conduct a user study to measure the performance of programmers using concept maps to assist with locating concepts. The results demonstrate that programmer learning occurs during concept location and that concept maps assisted programmers with capturing programmer learning and successful concept location. © 2012 World Scientific Publishing Co.

AB  - This chapter compares faculty self-assessment of teaching with student opinion of instruction in an online environment, in order to determine the level of agreement between faculty self-assessment and student assessment, in areas of overall program strength and directions for individual and whole-group professional development. A faculty selfassessment of teaching inventory based on established guidelines was administered to participating faculty in the Master of Library Science program at East Carolina University, and scores were compared to students' ratings of instruction for one academic year. Scores were corrected for bias, tabulated, and Pearson correlation and t-scores were calculated. The method used produced an effective benchmarking and diagnostic tool, and indicated directions for instructional improvement. Because the study was for the express purpose of internal, formative evaluation, model data tabulations are presented as examples only. Data from the actual study are not presented. Limitations of the study are that items on student evaluation of teaching surveys may not always lend themselves to concept mapping, and that data were collected only for one academic year in a single program. The chapter contributes a method that is replicable and scalable, demonstrates that data are relatively easy to acquire, and that procedures are simple to implement, requiring only basic statistical tests and measures for analysis. Results can be interpreted and understood without extensive knowledge of quantitative methods. There are few studies that compare students teaching evaluations with faculty self-evaluations, and none that specifically address it for library and information science education programs. © 2012 by Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - In recent years, researchers have proposed various approaches for developing adaptive learning systems based on concept maps. Nevertheless, most of them deal only with binary grades of each test item. In this paper, we present a new method to automatically construct concept maps based on fuzzy set theory that can construct concept maps based on the result of analysis of numerical testing scores. The proposed method can overcome the drawbacks of existing methods and provides a useful way to automatically concept maps in adaptive learning systems. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Programme description: Each concept in the enriched skeleton concept map (ESCoM) contained annotated multimedia-rich content (pictures, text, animations or video clips) that elaborated the concept, and an embedded collaboration script to guide students' interactions. Sample: The study was performed in a Biomolecules course on the Bachelor of Applied Science program in the Netherlands. All first-year students (N=93, 31 women, 62 men, aged 17-33 years) took part in this study. Design and methods: The design used a control group who received the regular course and an experimental group working together in dyads on an ESCoM under the guidance of collaboration scripts. In order to investigate meaningful understanding and retention, a retention test was administered a month after the final exam. Results: Analysis of covariance demonstrated a significant experimental effect on the Biomolecules exam scores between the experimental group and the control, and the difference between the groups on the retention test also reached statistical significance. Conclusions: Scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping resulted in meaningful understanding and retention of the conceptual structure of the domain, the concepts, and their relations. Not only was scripted collaborative multimedia ESCoM mapping more effective than the traditional teaching approach, it was also more efficient in requiring far less teacher guidance. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Students' alternative ideas about evolution are often poorly integrated. One cause could be the difficulty in linking observable (phenotype) and unobservable (genotype) concepts. This study investigates how two different treatments (generation and critique) of a novel form of computer-supported concept map can support students' collaborative learning from an inquiry-based evolution curriculum. Findings indicate that students in both treatment groups gained significantly in connecting genotype and phenotype ideas. Results suggest that critiquing concept maps can be used as a more time-efficient alternative to generating concept maps. © ISLS.

AB  - In fall 2010 and winter 2011, two new courses in systems thinking were initiated as core curriculum in the master's programme in Creative Sustainability at Aalto University in Finland. As intensive courses, each was to be conducted as three full days of lectures over eight days, with students fulfilling credit hour requirements both independently and in group activities over a two-to-three month period. To complement the teaching staff at the university, a researcher active in the systems science community was brought in from abroad as a subject matter expert for the two courses. In the summer preceding the first session, a reading list for the courses was drawn from current leading sources in the systems sciences, starting from 2010 and linking back to prior references of relevance. Lectures were prepared as minimal critical specifications, with concepts mapped into clusters of references, with the majority of sources available electronically over the Internet. On each set of the three lecture days, the courses were delivered in a face-to-face classroom setting, coupled with group activities designed in the style of Singerian inquiring systems. Coordinating artifacts from the instructors evolved and were incrementally updated on a publicly-accessible web site, and students followed the social media style of posting their reflections on publicly-visible weblogs linked with notifications on an activity stream at a systems community hub. Supplementing the chronological recollections of development and learning during the courses sessions, theoretical reflections constructed in hindsight may serve to inform the form and content of similar educational opportunities in other contexts. Preparations are underway as the courses are being naturally evolved for a second cohort of students in fall 2011. The completion of one cycle of two courses presents an opportunity for reflections on the approach employed in the innovation/startup cycle, with considerations for improvements and/or replication for similar programs in the future.

AB  - Due to the advancement in information and communication technology and vast varied learner group, e-learning has become popular. For achieving the adaptivity in learning, predefined concept map is used to provide proper guidance. In most of the researches, weight of concepts in each learning item is not properly considered. In this study, a three phase prerequisite concept map formulation for adaptivity is proposed. This approach is a most efficient one, since the first phase discards all the unrelated items which may distract the further analysis. Here, Norm-referencing in Item Analysis approach is used to find the item discrimination for elimination of irrelevant items. The second phase, computes all the grade association rules. The weight of concept in each learning item is considered and prerequisite concept sets are found which is not having any redundancy and cyclic in its map, thereby facilitating the next step of procedure. The final phase constructs the concept map with maximum confidence in a capable manner. Finally, the Prerequisite concept map can be used in tutoring system, thereby enhancing the adaptivity in e-learning. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - For almost a century, students of educ ation have suffered under the yoke of the behavioural psychologists, who see learning as synonymous with a change in behaviour. We reject this view, and observe instead that learning by humans leads to a change in the meaning of exper ience.... Furthermore, behavioural psychology, and much of currently popular cognitive science, neglects the significance of feelingsHuman experience involves not only thinking and acting but also feeling, and it is only when all three are considered together that individuals can be empowered to enrich the meaning of their experience. © 2000 Clive Erricker and Jane Erricker.

AB  - Background: Bearing in mind the philosophical pedagogical significance of short phrases for the training of researchers in the health care ambit, we hence have studied the aphorisms and striking phrases expressed during the epidemiology course at the Andalusian School of Public Health. Methods: Belonging to the qualitative type and applied through the establishment of a multidisciplinary focus group made up of ten post-graduated students, where one of them acted as a moderator. The collection of information lasted four months. Information was classified in two ways: Firstly, aphorisms and short phrases with a pedagogical impact; and secondly, data with statistical, epidemiological, epistemological, pragmatic, or heuristic component, and for scientific diffusion. It was decided to perform a triangulation that included a descriptive presentation and a basic categorical analysis. The two teachers with a highest interpretative load have been identified. Results: A total of 127 elements, regarded as of interest by the focus group, were collected. Forty-four of them (34.6%) were aphorisms, and 83 were short phrases with a pedagogical load (65.3%). Most of all them were classified as statistical elements (35.4%) followed by epistemological (21.3%) and epidemiological (15.7%) elements. There was no tendency towards aphorisms or short phrases (P > 0.05) among the teachers with more informative representation. Conclusion: There has been a tilt in the contents towards the statistical area to the detriment of the epidemiological one. Concept maps have visualized classifications. This sort of qualitative analysis helps the researcher review contents acquired during his/her training process.

AB  - This paper proposes a scaffolded concept mapping strategy, which considers a student's (high or low) prior knowledge, and provides flexible learning aids (scaffolding and fading) for reading and drawing a concept map. The goal is that the whole class should progress in synchronized fashion through this strategy, with each student achieving meaningful learning. The scaffolding is tailored to the student's needs, with various levels of support. The increasing demand for scaffolding, and its constant evolution, means that software aids are needed. The authors adopted a systematic instructional design, with associated software, to create a learning environment that supports the execution of the strategy. The paper also investigates whether this strategy improved student learning for 54 undergraduates in a database management system course. The results indicate that the students who used the strategy had better learning achievements than those who only experienced traditional lectures. Moreover, the implementation of the strategy received positive student feedback. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper we discuss the role of visual resources, namely Greek Sign Language videos, concept maps and pictures, and their allocation in a multimedia educational software designed to enhance reading comprehension in deaf children. First, we summarize research findings from three bodies of literature that informed the design of the software: reading comprehension and deaf children, the role of visual displays in reading comprehension and multimedia learning theories. In the following part, we describe the software "See and See" and explain how relevant theory and research regarding visual displays and multimedia learning has been applied to its design. Finally, we present a pilot evaluation of "See and See" regarding the students' interaction with the software and its role in reading comprehension. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This paper concentrates on building up a model of how existing knowledge can be learned and applied successfully in new product development. Our case based research draws upon constructivist learning theory, on conceptual change theory combined with findings in cognitive neuroscience. Describing the cases and theoretical development we build the model that focuses on existing knowledge as network, knowledge building, knowledge representation and procedural knowledge. We have achieved better learning result by teaching the subject as visualised elements and relationships between the elements as a model. The simulation game involves multiple memory types and facilitates knowledge integration when the learning process consists of doing, time for reflecting, discussion on the concepts and their meanings. When the students can apply knowledge based on experiences within minutes the neural connections strengthen. Time needs to be reserved also for metacognitive activities, such as making conscious choices on problem solving rather than using rote learning and procedural skills.

AB  - Purpose: The purpose of the research reported here is to improve comprehension of the socially-negotiated identity of concepts in the domain of knowledge organization. Because knowledge organization as a domain has as its focus the order of concepts, both from a theoretical perspective and from an applied perspective, it is important to understand how the domain itself understands the meaning of a concept. Design/methodology/approach: The paper provides an empirical demonstration of how the domain itself understands the meaning of a concept. The paper employs content analysis to demonstrate the ways in which concepts are portrayed in KO concept maps as signs, and they are subjected to evaluative semiotic analysis as a way to understand their meaning. The frame was the entire population of formal proceedings in knowledge organization - all proceedings of the International Society for Knowledge Organization's international conferences (1990-2010) and those of the annual classification workshops of the Special Interest Group for Classification Research of the American Society for Information Science and Technology (SIG/CR). Findings: A total of 344 concept maps were analyzed. There was no discernible chronological pattern. Most concept maps were created by authors who were professors from the USA, Germany, France, or Canada. Roughly half were judged to contain semiotic content. Peirceian semiotics predominated, and tended to convey greater granularity and complexity in conceptual terminology. Nodes could be identified as anchors of conceptual clusters in the domain; the arcs were identifiable as verbal relationship indicators. Saussurian concept maps were more applied than theoretical; Peirceian concept maps had more theoretical content. Originality/value: The paper demonstrates important empirical evidence about the coherence of the domain of knowledge organization. Core values are conveyed across time through the concept maps in this population of conference papers. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Groups of children at a science museum were pre- and post-assessed with a type of concept map, known as personal meaning maps, to determine what new understandings, if any, they were gaining from participation in a series of structured hands-on activities about bones and the process of bones healing. Close examination was made regarding whether children's prior knowledge or a ceiling effect was influencing results. Children made significant gains in vocabulary and concepts related to both bones and the bone healing process. Many children also demonstrated that their comprehension moved from a novice level to a transitional level of understanding. Prior to participation, children were more uniformly unacquainted with ideas about the healing process of bones than they were about bones; this led to more consistent learning gains related to the healing process. There was some indication of a ceiling effect occurring when children revealed what they had learned about bones, but not when they revealed what they had learned about the bone healing process. Although the prior knowledge theory was not statistically supported, data did show that children with greater understanding prior to the Busy Bones Lab activities end up with correspondingly greater understanding. This suggests that addressing concepts related to bones prior to a lab experience may bring more children to a higher level of understanding before engaging in the lab experience. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Our contemporary society asks for new strategies to manage knowledge. The main activities developed by academics involve knowledge transmission (teaching) and production (research). Creativity and collaboration are valuable assets for establishing learning organizations in classrooms and research labs. Concept mapping is a useful graphical technique to foster some of the disciplines required to create and develop highperformance teams. The need for a linking phrase to clearly state conceptual relationships makes concept maps (Cmaps) very useful for organizing our own ideas (externalization), as well as, sharing them with other people (elicitation and consensus building). The collaborative knowledge construction (CKC) is supported by Cmaps because they improve the communication signal-to-noise ratio among participants with high information asymmetry. In other words, we can identify knowledge gaps and insightful ideas in our own Cmaps when discussing them with our counterparts. Collaboration involving low and high information asymmetry can also be explored through peer review and student-professor/advisor interactions, respectively. In conclusion, when it is used properly, concept mapping can provide a competitive advantage to produce and share knowledge in our contemporary society. To map is to know, as stated by Wandersee in 1990 [20]. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - We have already proposed Kit-Build Concept Map (we call it as "KB map") that is a framework to realize automatic diagnosis of concept maps built by learners and to give feedback to their errors in the maps. In this paper, we report an experimental evaluation of KB map in science learning in an elementary school. Two classes of fourth grade students in an elementary school attended the experiment. "Waxing and Waning of the Moon" in science class was the topic of this experiment. The results suggested that the diagnosis and feedback with the KB map has positive effect to improve learner's understanding of this topic.

AB  - Knowledge integration involves pulling together ideas and information into a coherent framework such that new ideas can be linked into already established ideas, and groups of ideas can be mobilized for solving problems, answering questions, or understanding observations. Geoscientists are called on to integrate information from many different modes of inquiry, across different cultural and scientifi c traditions, in the face of incomplete evidence and in support of ill-structured problems. This paper explores fi ve strategies to foster knowledge integration through geoscience education: three organizational schemas for content, plus two integrative practices. These are (1) integrate around a locale of signifi cance to students, (2) integrate around a societally important problem, (3) integrate around a suite of "big ideas," (4) integrate using visual representations, and (5) integrate using physical and computer models. For each strategy, we describe examples of its use in geoscience education, critique advantages and potential disadvantages, and suggest questions for future research. We conclude with a thought experiment envisioning the nodes and linkages in hypothetical mental concept maps of students educated with each of these fi ve strategies, seeking to improve on a fragmented mental map of isolated nodes and weak linkages. © 2012 The Geological Society of America.

AB  - Collaborative learning provides opportunities to facilitate students' knowledge construction. However, students may face challenges while constructing meaning through dialogue. This study explored multiple forms of support to foster collaboration that would lead to a deeper understanding of science ideas and high-quality group concept maps. Ninety-five students from four 8 th grade science classrooms participated in this study. Using a 2 x 2 experimental design, we examined the effect of teacher modeling of prompts and the effect of meaningful individual preparation prior to collaboration on the quality of students' concept maps. Statistical analyses revealed that groups that prepared individual concept maps and received teacher modeling of prompts generated the highest quality concept maps. Further, teacher modeling of prompts was only found to be effective when combined with the individual preparation of concept maps prior to collaboration. Implications for classroom practice and future research are discussed. © ISLS.

AB  - Introduction: An estimated 500,000 critical care patient transports occur annually in the United States. Little research exists to inform optimal practices, promote safety, or encourage responsible, cost-effective use of this resource. Previous efforts to develop a research agenda have not yielded significant progress in producing much-needed scientific study. Purpose: Identify and characterize areas of research needed to direct the development of evidence-based guidelines Methods: The study used a modified Delphi technique to develop a concept map of the research domains in critical care transport. Proprietary, internet-based software was used for both data collection and analysis. The study was conducted in 3 phases: brainstorming, categorizing, and prioritizing, using experts from all aspects of critical care transport. Results: A total of 101 research questions were developed and ranked by 27 participants representing the transport community and stakeholders. An 8-cluster solution was developed with multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis to identify the following research areas: clinical care, education/training, finance, human factors, patient outcomes, safety, team configuration, and utilization. A plot characterized each domain by urgency and feasibility. Conclusion: The content and concepts represented by the cluster map can help direct research planning in the critical care transport industry and prioritize funding decisions. © 2013 Air Medical Journal Associates.

AB  - The processes of curricula, textbooks and student resources development have been broadly surveyed and studied while teachers' guides have received comparatively little consideration throughout recent reforms in science education. Ideal curriculum materials align instruction with the goals of reform. Well-designed teachers' guides contribute to communicating and supporting reform-based teaching. The purpose of this study was to investigate the functions and assistance that guides provide science teachers. A questionnaire was developed and administered to science teachers from a stratified sample of elementary and junior high schools in Taiwan. The findings indicated that the guides were of greater benefit to elementary school science teachers than they were to junior high teachers. These groups of teachers perceived the guides' usefulness differently, but they believed that a clear, concise presentation of the purpose, reminders, answer keys, concept maps of the main topics and learning progression provided the most helpful and preferred layout. Teachers felt that the function of a teachers' guide is to provide teaching resources rather than to guide teacher thinking. This study discusses design suggestions that can engage teacher thinking. © 2010 National Science Council, Taiwan.

AB  - In this work, an intelligent online argumentation platform that detects whether the learners address the expected discussion issues is proposed. The concept maps related to the learning topics are first outlined by the instructor. After each learner issues an argument on the learning platform, a term weighting method is adopted to derive inputs parameters of a Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classifier. The classifier then determines if the learners' arguments are related to the concept maps outlined by the instructor. Notably, a peer review mechanism is established in this work to improve the quality of term weighting approach. The experimental results revealed that the students in a junior high school participating in argumentation learning activities of natural science were benefited by the proposed argumentation based learning assistance platform. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Is it more important to "collect more knowledge" or to gain an understanding of how concepts relate so that a sustainable learning structure is formed? Active learning proponents would suggest it is more important to create a durable conceptual foundation by which new experiences are assimilated to grow the personal knowledge base in an orderly, well-formed way. But how can one assess that this is happening? In our project-centric courses we have adopted concept maps as a technique for evaluating the evolution of student understanding of conceptual knowledge in software engineering. This paper motivates the application of this existing technique in software engineering education, and presents a concept mapping assessment protocol based on a unique expert ranking process. An instance of the protocol implementation with results is presented and preliminary conclusions drawn. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - We discuss here how students organize their knowledge (in physics) by connecting closely related concepts. Attention is paid on the relational structure of the ordering of concepts so that the introduction of new concepts is justified on the basis of concepts which have already been learned. Consequently, there is then direction of progress in introducing new concepts - there is "flux of information" so that what was learned before is the basis for learning new conceptual knowledge. Such ordered and directed process of introducing the concepts can be conveniently described and analysed in the framework of directed ordered graphs. We propose here a model of knowledge organization for such concept maps. The model is based on the assumption that students use simple procedures connecting new concepts mostly to concepts introduced few steps before. On basis of the model results we suggest that the most important properties of concept maps can be understood on a basis of such simple rules for organising knowledge.

AB  - We describe development and evaluation of a learning support environment with error-based simulation functions using concept maps for class structure meaning. There are various relations between concepts in scientific domains, and understanding these relations is vital. Understanding class structure is particularly important. To that end, it is effective for learners to construct class structures by themselves. We develop a learning support environment using concept maps to aid the independent construction of structures by learners. The environment offers error-based simulation when learners make mistakes during construction. We report on implementation of the environment in a junior high school, and confirm that junior high school students can use the environment.

AB  - In this study, a computerized collaborative concept-mapping approach is proposed. To evaluate the effectiveness of this innovative approach, a learning activity has been conducted on an elementary school natural science course. Two hundred and twenty fifth graders from seven classes were divided into an experimental group, in which the students learned with the proposed approach, and a control group, in which the students learned with conventional computerized concept map approach. From the experimental results, it was found that the students in the experimental group had significantly better learning achievement than those in the control group. Furthermore, the cognitive load of the experimental group students were significantly lower than the ones in the control group, implying that computerized collaborative concept-mapping approach not only reduced the cognitive load, but also improved the learning achievements of the students. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - The paper presents a novel approach regarding adaptive and intelligent knowledge assessment using concept maps. The paper describes the knowledge assessment software system that has twofold goals in the context of the integration of technology into the traditional educational process: 1) to promote learners' knowledge self-assessment, and 2) to support the teacher in the improvement of the learning course through systematic assessment of learners' knowledge and analysis of its results. The goals are reached by the use of concept maps as an assessment tool and by providing opportunities to extend an initially created concept map for the next assessment stages and to present a learner information about his/her errors at the end of each assessment stage. The latter feature supports process oriented learning and makes the system unique among other similar systems. The system has been being developed already for 6 years by continuously improving its functionality. At the moment it offers a graphical user interface for manipulations of concept maps by the teacher and learners, the presentation of information about learners' errors, six tasks of different degrees of difficulty with adaptation of tasks' difficulty to each particular learner, an intelligent algorithm for the comparison of teacher's and learner's concept maps. In this paper the overview of the system is given specifying goals of the system, its discriminative features, the scenario of usage of the system and the results of testing the system in different study courses. © 2011 IADIS.

AB  - We have proposed a framework of kit-build concept map that can be diagnosed automatically, and have already implemented two fundamental softwares to practically use the kit-build concept map, that is, (1) KB-map Builder where learners can build concept map by combining provided kit, and (2) KB-map Analyzer that gathers the maps built by learners on-line and diagnoses them. We have been using the kit-build concept map in real class in an elementary school. This paper is a work-in-progress report of the practical use of the kit-build concept map for science learning in the elementary school. In this report, map building with tablet-PCs is mainly described. Based on the results of questionnaire, we have confirmed that the students found concept-map building useful, and preferred to use tablet-PCs rather than desk-top PCs.

AB  - Understanding evolution requires distinguishing ideas on observable (organism) and unobservable (genetic) levels. This study explored two different treatment groups using a novel form of concept map that elicits connections between levels: Student dyads compared their concept maps against an expert-generated or a peer-generated concept map. Both groups made significant gains connecting evolution ideas across levels, but used different criteria: The expert-map group focused mostly on surface criteria while the peer-review group used more specific criteria. © ISLS.

AB  - Objective: To determine the effect of Concept Maps on Knowledge Retention in Dental students. Study Design: Randomized study. Place and Duration of Study: This study was conducted at the Jinnah Medical and Dental College, Karachi. Materials and Methods: A randomized controlled trial was conducted on fifty students of BDS first year at the Jinnah Medical and Dental College, Karachi. The students were randomly divided into two groups. Initially the whole class was taught thefirst unit of Biochemistry (Carbohydrates) by the conventional method. It was followed by a Multiple Choice Questions test which established the equivalence in the mean scores of the two groups. The Intervention group now attended a workshop on "Concept Maps". In the next two units (Proteins and Lipids), the Intervention group made Concept Maps while the Control group continued with the conventional method. Each unit ended with an MCQ test. The score of the Unit test was taken as an indicator of short term retention of knowledge. Two months later, an unscheduled Retest was given consisting of all the MCQ given in the three Unit tests. The difference between the scores of the Unit tests and Retest was taken as an indicator of long term retention of knowledge. The mean scores of the two groups were compared using Independent samples t-test. Result: No significant difference was found in the mean scores of the Intervention and Control groups in the Unit tests. But in the Retest the Intervention group performed significantly better (p < 0.01) than the Control group. Conclusion: Learning through Concept Maps improves long term retention of knowledge.

AB  - This work explores the conceptual understanding attained by students in the area of parallel computing. Parallelism is continuing to grow as an important topic area in computer engineering and computer science. Even as it increases in popularity, only a limited amount of research has been done to determine how well students construct their knowledge of the field. This work aims to begin exploring the structure of parallel computing as understood by undergraduate computer engineering students. A small group of students was selected to create concept maps that illustrate their understanding. These maps have been used in many different areas of science and engineering. The maps were then analyzed and compared to a reference concept map developed by a group of computer engineering faculty. The results of this analysis revealed that students in this sample demonstrated a limited knowledge of parallelism and concurrency through the organization of their concept maps. The analysis of the concept maps also provides evidence that there is a moderate level of understanding of the challenges to implementing and controlling concurrency. However, the linkages created in the maps reveal students' misinterpretation of the goals of exploiting parallelism. © 2012 IEEE.

AB  - Concept maps are graphical representations of cognitive knowledge structures. Although they were originally developed as a way to follow and understand changes in student knowledge, they have proven to be effective instructional tools. Concept maps consist of labeled nodes that represent concepts, or perceived regularities or patterns, and links that are labeled to indicate the relationships between the nodes. Current work with concept maps is limited to small maps that cover only sections of a class or the entire class at a high level of abstraction. Due to problems in interpreting concept maps with numerous nodes and links, maps of larger domains are limited in the detail the can represent. The authors are exploring the use of interactive digital tools as a way to present large-scale concept maps that organize information and show connections across the curriculum without overwhelming the user visually. As an exemplar, the authors have chosen the content in an engineering statics course. If successful, the concept mapping tool could be used to cognitively link information between courses in engineering mechanics and then across the entire engineering curriculum. As the first step in this process, the authors set out to capture an expert's knowledge of engineering statics in the form of a course-wide concept map. This paper details the process of capturing expert knowledge of a course and organizing this information into a concept map that accurately represents the information taught in the course. © 2012 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - Inside the globalisation era in which society is immersed, one of the current challenges for any educational system is to provide quality education. While some countries are linguistically homogeneous, many countries and regions display a wealth of linguistic diversity and it is essential to adapt the educational system to those realities. In addition, multilingual education promotes no only social equality but also intercultural education. The development of computer software localisable not only at interface level but also regarding learning resources may help to fulfill this aim. During the lastyears a number of products have emerged to support computer-based concept mapping. This paper presents a pilot study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU i the area of database systems with three main aims: to facilitate learning abou the subject domain, to evaluate whether concept mapping is in general a good technique for learning topics in different languages, and finally, to verify whether CM-ED Concept Map EDitor provides the necessary mechanisms to fulfilthis objective. Results confirm that the use of a concept map editor is a good support for education in multilingual settings.

AB  - Background: To evaluate the scientific reasoning in basic science among undergraduate medical students, we established the National Medical Science Olympiad in Iran. In this Olympiad, the drawing of a concept map was used to evaluate a student's knowledge framework; students' ability in hypothesis generation and testing were also evaluated in four different steps. All medical students were invited to participate in this program. Finally, 133 undergraduate medical students with average grades ≥ 16/20 from 45 different medical schools in Iran were selected. The program took the form of four exams: drawing a concept map (Exam I), hypothesis generation (Exam II), choosing variables based on the hypothesis (Exam III), measuring scientific thought (Exam IV). The examinees were asked to complete all examination items in their own time without using textbooks, websites, or personal consultations. Data were presented as mean ± SE of each parameter. The correlation coefficient between students' scores in each exam with the total final score and average grade was calculated using the Spearman test. Results: Out of a possible score of 200, the mean ± SE of each exam were as follows: 183.88 ± 5.590 for Exam I; 78.68 ± 9.168 for Exam II; 92.04 ± 2.503 for exam III; 106.13 ± 2.345 for Exam IV. The correlation of each exam score with the total final score was calculated, and there was a significant correlation between them (p < 0.001). The scatter plot of the data showed a linear correlation between the score for each exam and the total final score. This meant that students with a higher final score were able to perform better in each exam through having drawn up a meaningful concept map. The average grade was significantly correlated with the total final score (R = 0.770), (p < 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between each exam score and the average grade (p < 0.001). The highest correlation was observed between Exam I (R = 0.7708) and the average grade. This means students with higher average grades had better grades in each exam, especially in drawing the concept map. Conclusions: We hope that this competition will encourage medical schools to integrate theory and practice, analyze data, and read research articles. Our findings relate to a selected population, and our data may not be applicable to all medical students. Therefore, further studies are required to validate our results. © 2012 Azarpira et al.

AB  - Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Participants were first year medical students (n=150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, p<0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry.

AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject's body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Our study focuses on the correlation of concept map (CMap) structures and learning success tested with short answer tests, taking into particular account the complexity of the subject matter. Novice sixth grade students created CMaps about two subject matters of varying difficulty. The correlation of the complexity of CMaps with the post-test was small but highly significant in both subject matters. The complexity of the CMaps correlated with the long-term knowledge in the difficult subject matter but not in the context of the easy one. Furthermore, the high number of technical errors makes it close to impossible to estimate students' knowledge. In summary, CMaps do not provide an adequate alternative to conventional short answer knowledge tests, but together with them they may offer a better comprehension of a student's knowledge structure and aid in the preparation of further instruction tailored to individual needs. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - University faculty are increasingly assuming responsibility for program assessment, with results being used in part to determine program quality. In some cases, results are being used to rationalize allocation of shrinking university resources. As a result, many faculty members are seeking simple and meaningful ways to prepare for and collect data for assessment purposes. Fashion Merchandising faculty at a medium-sized, southern university decided to experiment with concept mapping, a creative tool based on constructive learning theory, to plan for program assessment. The purpose of this paper is to explain the use of concept mapping in this context. Results show that concept maps have much to offer in assessment planning. Additional benefits of concept mapping are also discussed. © 2012 American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to measure the effects of higher level, inquiry-based science curricula on students at primary level in Title I schools. Approximately 3,300 K-3 students from six schools were assigned to experimental or control classes (N = 115 total) on a random basis according to class. Experimental students were exposed to concept-based science curriculum that emphasized 'deep learning' though concept mastery and investigation, whereas control classes learned science from traditional school-based curricula. Two ability measures, the Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (BBCS-R, Bracken 1998) and the Naglieri Nonverbal Intelligence Test (NNAT, Naglieri 1991), were used for baseline information. Additionally, a standardized measure of student achievement in science (the MAT-8 science subtest), a standardized measure of critical thinking, and a measure for observing teachers' classroom behaviors were used to assess learning outcomes. Results indicated that all ability groups of students benefited from the science inquiry-based approach to learning that emphasized science concepts, and that there was a positive achievement effect for low socio-economic young children who were exposed to such a curriculum. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The Semantic Web is a W3C approach that integrates the different sources of semantics within documents and services using ontology-based techniques. The main objective of this approach in the geoscience domain is the improvement of understanding, integration, and usage of Earth and space science related web content in terms of data, information, and knowledge for machines and people. The modeling and representation of semantic attributes and relations within and among documents can be realized by human readable concept maps and machine readable OWL documents. The objectives for the usage of the Semantic Web approach in the GFZ data center ISDC project are the design of an extended classification of metadata documents for product types related to instruments, platforms, and projects as well as the integration of different types of metadata related to data product providers, users, and data centers. Sources of content and semantics for the description of Earth and space science product types and related classes are standardized metadata documents (e.g., DIF documents), publications, grey literature, and Web pages. Other sources are information provided by users, such as tagging data and social navigation information. The integration of controlled vocabularies as well as folksonomies plays an important role in the design of well formed ontologies.

AB  - The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has collaborated with the government of Singapore to create a new university, the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD); the first SUTD students began classes in May 2012. MIT contributed to the development of SUTD's undergraduate curriculum, and, as part of that effort, MIT's Teaching and Learning Laboratory (TLL) identified pivotal concepts and critical skills from what is called SUTD's "freshmore year," which encompasses the first three semesters of the students' course of study. The goal of identifying pivotal concepts and critical skills was to see how they supported learning throughout the SUTD curriculum, generally, and, specifically, how they were connected across disciplines. Using a "constructive alignment" process advocated by John Biggs and Catherine Tang, who recommend beginning the construction of a curriculum with intended learning outcomes, and a process for "clarifying content priorities" advocated by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe, we began the difficult task of identifying pivotal concepts and critical skills. We were fortunate in that faculty and instructional staff from MIT had already begun the process of defining SUTD's curriculum. Most of the courses in the freshmore year already had a number of intended learning outcomes associated with them. By considering what concepts and skills would support these intended learning outcomes, concepts considered to be truly interdisciplinary according to the literature on integrated curricula, and concepts documented to be problematic for students in the literature on student misconceptions and misunderstandings, we began to refine our list of pivotal concepts and critical skills. In the end, a concept or skill was identified as pivotal when it satisfied one of two criteria: (1) it was prerequisite for multiple concepts that would be taught in upper-level courses; or (2) it was pervasive across disciplines. The result of this process was an Engineering Curriculum Map (the "Map"), which diagrams, for both faculty and students, the crucial ideas and capabilities SUTD students should master in their first three semesters. The Map also visually represents the interdisciplinary connections among concepts that may otherwise appear to be from disparate disciplines (e.g., physics, math, biology, chemistry). After the Map was developed, it guided the creation of a set of 15-minute videos narrated by MIT faculty and graduate students, called "concept vignettes," which contribute to the curricular materials available to SUTD. These videos teach pivotal concepts and critical skills by utilizing animations, visualizations, and/or demonstrations. The intention of the Map and concept vignettes is to provide students with a coherent educational framework by bringing pivotal concepts to the forefront of the learning experience. We hope the Engineering Curriculum Map will be of interest to curriculum developers, department chairs, and professors of both introductory and more advanced engineering courses. By highlighting pivotal concepts that reappear throughout the curriculum, our goal is to help instructors and faculty provide additional opportunities for students to revisit these concepts within their courses.

AB  - The Piper Alpha disaster of 1988 remains the worst offshore oil platform disaster in history. The loss of 167 lives was caused by a range of factors including human error, poor safety training and poor safety management systems. The events that led up to the first explosion and then the subsequent fires and larger explosions provide an excellent context in which to introduce first year engineering students to the importance of safety in an introductory course. The loss of the Piper Alpha platform has been used as a case study in a general first year engineering subject at the University of Melbourne for several years. This paper begins by describing the background of the platform, the events of July 6, 1988 and the lessons that may be learned from the disaster. The learning around this safety case study is assessed in the class room using concept maps. An analysis of 460 concept maps prepared by the class 15 weeks after the material had been presented to them provides an insight into how well the students integrated and retained the material from the case study. Students recalled well the causes of the disaster as well as the consequences and lessons that should be learned from the incident. © 2013 The Institution of Chemical Engineers.

AB  - The objectives of this study were (1) to determine physics student teachers' understanding of energy and related concepts and (2) to determine how they associate energy with other related concepts. Twenty six first-year physics student teachers (STs) participated in this study. STs' understanding levels were determined using a questionnaire requiring defining energy and related concepts verbally, and how they associate these concepts was determined through concept mapping. Findings revealed that the STs were not able to use their understandings they were supposed to have about the energy and related concepts while linking energy and related concepts. In the light of this study, it was concluded that students have difficulty in learning energy and related concepts in an instructional approach based on work concept. © Sila Science.

AB  - Conceptual understanding of physics is based on understanding what the key concepts are and how they are related. In learning and teaching connections which tie concepts to each other give direction of progress - there is a flux of information. We discuss here how such ordering of concepts can be made visible by using concept maps and how the maps can be used in analysing the students' views and ideas about the inherent logic of the relatedness of concepts. The approach discussed here is informed by the recent cognitively oriented ideas of knowledge organization concentrating on simple knowledge-organization patterns and how they form the basis of more complex concept networks. The results show that even in well connected maps there can be abrupt changes in the information flux in the way knowledge is passed from the initial levels to the final levels. This suggests that handling the information content is very demanding and perhaps a very difficult skill for a teacher student to master.

AB  - Textbooks often provide teachers and students a conception of how scientific knowledge is organized. Therefore, it is of interest to recognize what is the picture of knowledge conveyed by the textbooks. In this study, the knowledge organization in three university physics textbooks is analyzed from the viewpoint of how the basic elements in the topics of Biot-Savart and Ampère's law are structurally linked. The method of analysis is based on the interpretative analysis, which (a) recognizes basic elements of knowledge and (b) identifies the categories of links that connect basic elements. Concept maps are used to represent knowledge organization of textbooks. The results indicate that content knowledge of textbooks consist of somehow identical basic elements but different categories of links and thus different knowledge organizations. The possibility to recognize these differences in the curriculum materials is a first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solutions and curriculum plans.

AB  - Prior research has shown that people are likely to skim information presented digitally with the resultant deleterious effect on accurate mental models of the text. Teaching monitoring strategies and presenting text with adjunct questions are effective strategies for improving the mental models of readers of scientific text, but the two strategies have not been directly compared for studying text read from a computer screen. In the present study, participants were individually tested in two experiments in which they studied computer-based text on the heart and circulatory system while either reading the text with no interruption, answering adjunct inference questions, answering adjunct factual questions, or answering prompts for global or specific monitoring. Reading time was untimed but looking back was not available. Prompting for global monitoring was most effective for improvement of mental models as measured by scores in diagram drawing, concept map construction, factual memory, and generating inferences. Further, global monitoring did not require more time-on-task than the other methods. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill-structured and interconnected. Concept-mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill-structured. Evaluations of concept-mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade-point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept-mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The newly created concentration in bioprocess engineering at East Carolina University was developed with a novel curriculum designed to engage the students and improve their mastery of concepts using proven pedagogical approaches. This study presents the development of nine instructional modules for three bioprocess engineering courses (three modules per course) and the assessment of the effectiveness of the instructional modules. Each module is initiated by presenting the students with a challenge question. The students work on the challenge by completing a cycle of exercises that are designed to engage critical thinking and self-assessment, and for making connections among concepts within the course. The module culminates with students presenting their 'answer' to the challenge through various means, such as a report, poster, video, exam, etc. Of the nine modules, three are integrated through the different bioprocess engineering courses. This integration provides a theme for the students to make connections among the different courses and to transfer concepts to new situations. Our work sought to provide the answers to two research questions: 1) Did the students master the facts, skills, and concepts of bioprocess engineering through the use of the modules? and 2) Did the use of the modules create an effective How People Learn (HPL) learning environment within the three bioprocess engineering courses? The results of the assessment indicate that the modules were effective in developing the students' mastery of the facts, skills, and concepts across all three courses and created a very effective HPL learning environment in two of the three courses.

AB  - Background: Concept-mapping and interview techniques are used to track knowledge and understanding over the duration of PhD study amongst four students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards their PhDs. This work is in contrast to much PhD supervision research and policy research that focuses on supervisory styles and roles and may decontextualise the topic and disciplinary setting.Purpose: The work investigates the understanding of the process and product in PhD-level research and supervision.Sample: Participants were four students and their supervisor(s). Case studies were based on longitudinal studies conducted over three to four years (the duration of a PhD). The students were all enrolled in lab-based PhDs in one UK-based higher education institution. Three of the four students were international (one EU-based) and three supervisors were from outside the UK.Design and methods: The data provide documentary evidence of the ways in which these supervisors act to facilitate learning and discovery of research processes and an understanding of lab-based science research supervision. In the initial interview (conducted separately with students and supervisors), the interviewee constructed two maps, one on the topic of the PhD and one on the process of a PhD. In subsequent interviews, the student or supervisor reviewed and updated the previously constructed maps. Transcripts of the interviews were made as well. These data draw on 72 interviews and 96 unique concept maps constructed. The challenges of a PhD being both a process of learning (for the student and the supervisor) and a product of a research project are explored using case study analysis of these four pairs.Findings and discussion: Analyses of the collected data suggested that the students focused more on the product of a PhD (completing a thesis and publication), whereas the supervisors concentrated on the process of learning and scientific development.Conclusions: Evidence in the study suggested product/process differences in the student and supervisor conceptualisation of the PhD. This paper offers development towards a research-led pedagogy of supervision that places the process and product of a PhD at the centre of the supervisory relationship. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The term metaconceptual refers to metacognitive knowledge and processes that are acting on and related to one's conceptual system. In this study, metaconceptual teaching activities were implemented to facilitate pre-service teachers' engagement in metaconceptual processes. It was the purpose of this research to investigate the changes in pre-service teachers' alternative ideas regarding flowering plants after being exposed to metaconceptual teaching activities. The participants consisted of 32 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in a college level second-year laboratory class about flowering plants. A 13 item open-ended question set was administered a week before and a week after the instructional interventions. In order to facilitate students' engagement in metaconceptual processes, they were exposed to several instructional activities including poster drawing, journal writing, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. Alternative conceptions that pre-service teachers had prior to and following the instructional interventions were identified and the ones that changed, did not change and developed after the instruction were examined. The results of this study show that metaconceptual teaching activities were effective at changing pre-service teachers' alternative conceptions regarding flowering plants. © 2011 Eḡitim Dani{dotless}şmanli{dotless}ḡi{dotless} ve AraŞti{dotless}rmalari{dotless} Iletişim Hizmetleri Tic.

AB  - At present, the training of professionals in Higher Education challenges docents to incorporate in their teaching practice, not only expertise of pure disciplinary content, it also calls for associated aptitudes of didactic knowledge to guide the disciplinary knowledge. This study intends to contribute new teaching methodologies in the form of didactic software for Histology students in the Nursing Degree program, Faculty of Health Sciences of the Universidad Autónoma De Chile. These interactive modules were created as support for traditional classes and practical steps with microscopic observation. For the development of the first module, a total of 200 images were digitalized in JPG format. From those images presentations with personal animation were realized, which were then converted to Adobe Flash Player thus creating the first software entitled "Histological Module". We incorporated functional information to the initial module of histological preparation in addition to concept maps. This innovation was particularly attractive and we decided to modify the initial software, thereby creating the second program entitled "Histo-functional Module". To compare student perception on both modules a previously validated, voluntary and anonymous opinion survey was carried out that included questions on factors related to: content, motivation, utility, quality and quantity. Responses were evaluated by Likert scale. Results objectively reflected the favorable acceptance that the histo-functional Module has had on the part of our students. This is probably the result of this software integrating knowledge of structures and their function, affording it meaning and facilitating learning as well as motivating students in the study of histology.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to determine the thoughts of primary science and technology teachers, primary class teachers, pre-service primary class teachers and pre-service primary science and technology teachers' about concept maps. This scale applied the use of basic and random method on the chosen 125 4th and 5th grade primary class teachers who had science and technology courses and primary science and technology teachers from 14 primary schools in Afyonkarahisar. Also, the scale was applied to 150 2nd grade pre-service primary class teachers and 30 1st grade pre-service primary science and technology teachers in a Department of Primary Education from Mustafa Kemal University in Turkey. The general scanning model was used in this study, while t-test, one way ANOVA test, frequency and percentage values were calculated. However, analysis of the qualitative data was done by content analysis. As a result of the research findings obtained in the framework, teachers' and preservice teachers' attitudes towards the use of concept maps is identified as positive. According to gender and class levels, which are independent variables, there are no significant differences of preservice teachers' towards using concept maps. According to the branch and seniority, there are important significant differences of teachers' attitudes towards using concept maps. As a result of the findings from researches, some suggestions are presented. © 2011 Academic Journals.

AB  - This article reports the results of a small-scale curriculum development project focusing on two of the seven 'key concepts' identified in the revised Key Stage 3 (KS3) National Curriculum programme of study for geography, introduced into schools in 2007. The study used 'interdependence' and 'physical processes' as part of a conceptual framework for creating a holistic approach to the subject, underpinned by the notion of threshold concepts. Year 9 students (aged 13-14 years) undertook classroom work investigating atmosphere, oceans, volcanoes and glaciers to develop an understanding of process, landscape, life and futures, while also considering the interdependent nature of these areas, to build an understanding of global physical systems. Use was made of student questioning and concept mapping to create 'liminal spaces' in which students could develop deeper understanding of interdependent processes and patterns. Perceptual results from student and teacher interviews suggest that a holistic curriculum was popular and also led to a greater level of critical understanding and a relational underpinning to approaching the subject. © 2011 British Curriculum Foundation.

AB  - In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee described his vision of what would come to be called the World Wide Web (WWW, hereinafter referred to as Web). He based his proposal on the notion that a “web” or “mesh” of hyperlinked documents (papers, commentaries, etc.) might be more supportive of information preservation, information sharing, and collaboration activities than more restrictive £xed hierarchies or “trees.” Furthermore, he argued that information would be more useful if the relations among documents could be given meaningful labels. He illustrated his ideas using a diagram (Berners-Lee 1990). In his diagram he used circles called “nodes” to depict individual documents and concepts (images, etc.), and he used labeled lines called “links” to express relations. Node-link node triples in his diagram expressed propositions. For example, a circle enclosing the words “This Document” was linked by a line to another circle containing the words “A Proposal, " and appearing midway along the line was the relational term “describes.” Hence this node-link-node triple expressed the proposition: This Document describes A Proposal. Berners-Lee used this meaningful diagram to express how documents, hypertext, and other media could be shared over a network of computers that would also support conferencing and other collaborative activities. In referring to his diagram, he wrote (Berners-Lee 1990; reprinted in Berners-Lee 1999, pp. 213-216): The Web infrastructure for integrating and hyperlinking multimedia (Berners-Lee’s “client-server” model) can support methods of knowledge sharing and collaboration that are limited perhaps only by the designer’s imagination. Ironically, however, many “pages” on the Web, especially those that are intended for use in education and distance learning, appear very much like pages from the Gutenberg Bible: Somewhere near the top will be a graphic of some sort (e.g., a picture of a £sh for course material in biology), and below it will simply be an outline and some scanned-in text, through which one proceeds just as if using a printed book. One might wonder if the current evolution of the Web is in some ways simply reinventing the wheel and doing so in a way that fails to capitalize on the capabilities and possibilities that the Web offers. © 2011 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Our study monitored the cognitive and motivational effects within different educational instruction schemes: On the one hand, teacher-centred versus hands-on instruction; on the other hand, handson instruction with and without a knowledge consolidation phase (concept mapping). All the instructions dealt with the same content. For all participants, the hands-on approach as well as the concept mapping adaptation were totally new. Our hands-on approach followed instruction based on "learning at work stations". A total of 397 high-achieving fifth graders participated in our study. We used a pre-test, post-test, retention test design both to detect students' short-term learning success and long-term learning success, and to document their decrease rates of newly acquired knowledge. Additionally, we monitored intrinsic motivation. Although the teacher-centred approach provided higher short-term learning success, hands-on instruction resulted in relatively lower decrease rates. However, after six weeks, all students reached similar levels of newly acquired knowledge. Nevertheless, concept mapping as a knowledge consolidation phase positively affected short-term increase in knowledge. Regularly placed in instruction, it might increase long-term retention rates. Scores of interest, perceived competence and perceived choice were very high in all the instructional schemes. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Participants performed a visual-vestibular motor recalibration task in virtual reality. The task consisted of keeping the extended arm and hand stable in space during a whole-body rotation induced by a robotic wheelchair. Performance was first quantified in a pre-test in which no visual feedback was available during the rotation. During the subsequent adaptation phase, optical flow resulting from body rotation was provided. This visual feedback was manipulated to create the illusion of a smaller rotational movement than actually occurred, hereby altering the visual-vestibular mapping. The effects of the adaptation phase on hand stabilization performance were measured during a post-test that was identical to the pre-test. Three different groups of subjects were exposed to different perspectives on the visual scene, i.e., first-person, top view, or mirror view. Sensorimotor adaptation occurred for all three viewpoint conditions, performance in the posttest session showing a marked under-compensation relative to the pre-test performance. In other words, all viewpoints gave rise to a remapping between vestibular input and the motor output required to stabilize the arm. Furthermore, the first-person and mirror view adaptation induced a significant decrease in variability of the stabilization performance. Such variability reduction was not observed for the top view adaptation. These results suggest that even if all three viewpoints can evoke substantial adaptation aftereffects, the more naturalistic first-person view and the richer mirror view should be preferred when reducing motor variability constitutes an important issue. © Springer-Verlag 2011.

AB  - We report here a study employing the STS approach for developing a learning unit on biocontrol for secondary school students to enhance their understanding of the impact of pesticides, their knowledge of biocontrol of insect pests, and their attitude toward the environment. We focused on the analysis of the impact of pesticides and the success of insect pest biocontrol by the cooperative effort of students, school teachers, local sages, and agriculturists. The students not only learned about the insect pests and other natural enemies of plants in the rice fields, they also learned from the laboratory and local experts. Five instruments were used to assess students' achievement in terms of knowledge and attitude: pretest and posttest, concept map, questionnaire, semi-structured interview, and classroom observation. The results showed a significant enhancement in students' knowledge and understanding of pesticides, insect pests and enemies of plants, and biological control. Students also became more aware and friendly toward the environment. © Common Ground, Kanrawee Pewnim, Watcharee Ketpichainarong, Bhinyo Panijpan, Pintip Ruenwongsa.

AB  - Ensuring the competence of healthcare professionals' is core to undergraduate and post-graduate education. Undergraduate pharmacy students and pre-registration graduates are required to demonstrate competence at dispensing and accuracy checking medicines. However, competence differs from understanding. This study determined the competence and understanding of undergraduate students and pharmacists at accuracy checking dispensed medicines. Third year undergraduate pharmacy students and first year post-graduate diploma pharmacists participated in the study, which involved an accuracy checking task and concept mapping exercise. Participants accuracy checked eight medicines which contained 13 dispensing errors and then constructed a concept map illustrating their understanding of the accuracy checking process. The error detection rates and types of dispensing errors detected by undergraduates and pharmacists were compared using Mann-Whitney and chi-square, respectively. Statistical significance was p ≤ 0.05. Concept maps were qualitatively analysed to identify structural typologies. Forty-one undergraduates and 78 pharmacists participated in the study. Pharmacists detected significantly more dispensing errors (85%) compared to the undergraduates (77%, p ≤ 0.001). Only one undergraduate and seven pharmacists detected all dispensing errors. The majority of concept maps were chains (undergraduates = 46%, n = 19; pharmacists = 45%, n = 35) and spokes (undergraduates = 54%, n = 22; pharmacists = 54%, n = 42) indicating surface learning. One pharmacist, who detected all dispensing errors in the accuracy checking exercise, created a networked map characteristic of deep learning. Undergraduate students and pharmacists demonstrated a degree of operational competence at detecting dispensing errors without fully understanding the accuracy checking process. Accuracy checking training should be improved at undergraduate and post-graduate level so that pharmacists are equipped with the knowledge and understanding to accurately check medicines and detect dispensing errors, thereby safeguarding patient safety. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In this study, we introduced the students to experimenting with and manufacturing of real products. The products are a "Model Car" and a "Walking Model." With this specific objective and using no special equipment, students can learn and utilize mechanics which is one of the fundamental discipline in engineering. We introduced these two products in a lecture format and evaluated the effectiveness of the learning process. Results of the evaluation administered before and after the class showed that the students obtained a greater understanding of mechanics by using the two products. A resulting concept map and survey questionnaire showed that the students had improved their ability to apply scientific knowledge through their practical experiences in experimental and manufacturing processes. Moreover, detailed analyses including factor analysis suggest an improvement in the students' confidence in their scientific knowledge and activities in product making. ©2010 Society for Experimental Mechanics Inc.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) to investigate the characteristics of students' observation competence. The authors assume that the students' observation competence can be enriched by meaningful experiences and the performance is situated in specific content or context. The facets included in CEOCA are knowledge, observation (on multi-media), concept mapping of wetland ecology. A total of 454 6th, and 7th graders were sampled in this study. The average difficulty (p value) is.62 for the sample. The correlation coefficients between CEOCA and related variables such as school math or science score are around.46 to.54. The pattern of correlation coefficients demonstrates sensible supporting evidences for the convergent and discriminant validity. The implications for further researches are also discussed.

AB  - The paper is dedicated to OWL ontology derivation from concept maps (CMs) which have been created using the intelligent knowledge assessment system (IKAS). Usage of IKAS allows capturing quite a lot of CMs of different topics covered in several study courses taught at the Faculty of Computer Science and Information Technology of Riga Technical University (RTU). Captured CMs can be used as parts for building the ontology describing a study course and a full programme. Besides using different already developed reasoning tools an ontology can be a source for further audit of the programme. The paper presents the algorithm for OWL ontology generation from CMs. © 2011 ACM.

AB  - The College of Technology - Computer Engineering Technology (CoT - CETE) program at the University of Houston has implemented a peer mentoring model funded through an NSF-sponsored grant supporting undergraduate STEM learning. A group of high achieving seniors were recruited to serve as mentors to students in lower-division laboratories. These mentors were expected to have a high level of technical knowledge and skill and also serve as guides and role models for their mentees. To support this process, training for the mentors was adapted from a peer-led team learning program and incorporated concept mapping as a primary pedagogical tool for increasing mentee understanding of key concepts. Over the course of a two-year implementation, mentors faced several challenges that undercut the impact of the mentoring sessions. Ultimately, faculty had to redesign the peer-mentor model to address these challenges and improve the potential efficacy of the program. This paper discusses the challenges faced by mentors and lessons learned during the project implementation. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

PY  - 2011
T2  - ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition, Conference Proceedings

AB  - The study of linear physical systems is one of the topics in engineering with a rich interplay among the topics and no natural order in which to present the material. In this paper, we describe a system that uses topic maps to emphasize these interrelationships without imposing an arbitrary hierarchy on the material presented. For example, in terms of types of systems, mechanical systems can be taught first, or electrical. In terms of transforms, Laplace can be taught first, or Fourier, or even the Z-transform. There are also many relationships between topics. Examples include the transforms mentioned previously, the different types of physical system (electrical, mechanical, thermal.), and different solution methods such as state-space and transfer functions. By their very nature, textbooks must present and follow a linear path through the material, and any two textbooks are likely to follow very different paths. Web-based presentation of the material removes part of this problem because the material need not be presented linearly, but raises the prospect of a chaotic portrayal of the subjects because HTML links are merely from text to text and have no inherent meaning. Another way to present such interrelated ideas is through the use of topic maps. Topic maps are used to represent these interrelationships using topics (concepts), associations (the relationships between topics) and occurrences (information, e.g., web pages, relating to the topics). This is distinct from concept maps and other commonly used visual methods for organizing information in that the ideas need not be hierarchical; for example Fourier Transforms are not a subset of Laplace transforms (or vice-versa) as is presented in most textbooks. In addition the topics have certain roles in the association that give the link meaning, a clear advantage over traditional HTML hyperlinks and other methods. We have developed a system using HTML, PHP, JavaScript and XML that enables a user to author a topic map, as well as to present a graphical visualization of that map. When visualizing a map, a topic is selected (by clicking on it), and all related topics are displayed around it. Included in the display are the associations and roles played by each topic in that association. Topics can also have other information (occurrences in the form of HTML links, simulations.) that give explanatory detail about the topic, including descriptions of how it is related to other, associated, topics. While many textbooks (and even web-based presentations) have only short sections describing the interrelationships between topics, this system puts the relationship at the core of the presentation of the material to make it more clear why a particular topic is being learned and how it fits into the larger context of linear systems. © 2011 American Society for Engineering Education.

AB  - This paper reports a study to investigate the effects of collaborative concept mapping of a 1:1 (one-device-per-student) digital learning environment, comparing with a1:m (one-device-to-many-students) environment in terms of three aspects: students' overall learning gains, knowledge retention and quality of the concept maps. Participants were 6th-grade students from an elementary school. Guided by the methodology of quasi-experimental research, we adopted Group Scribbles (GS) 1.0 in our empirical study. We evaluated these two settings in the Social Studies course, assessing the quality of the collaboratively constructed concept maps and students' learning attitudes. The results indicated that although little difference in the concept map scores between students engaged in the two settings was found, the standard deviations of the 1:1 groups had been greater than those of the 1:m groups. According to our analysis, the reason of the greater differences in the performances among individual 1:1 group members would be that the levels of group bonding had a greater influence on the effectiveness of their collaborations. Due to space limitations, the interviews and questionnaires data will not present in this paper. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - Reflective learning can assist a learner's purposeful and conscious manipulation of ideas toward meaningful learning and knowledge integration. Blogs have been used to support reflection, but Blogs usually do not provide overt mechanisms for students to make connections between different parts of an experience, which is integral to reflective activity. A blogging-mapping tool was designed to support the reflective learning process. The tool allowed students to write blog posts, attach up to five keywords to each post, and link the keywords on a concept map. This study aimed to seek patterns of participants' use of the tool, including evidence of reflective learning, identified as integration between concept maps and blogs. Nine graduate students participated in the study for a semester. Data analysis included examining concept maps for knowledge integration over time. Participants' various mapping activities implied different levels of thinking. Some participants' final concept maps showed signs that they tried to integrate knowledge around the content area. Yet, the inconsistent and inconclusive patterns of participants' concept mapping activities signaled that more strategies were needed to sustain their commitment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to find out the influence of interactive and on site teaching strategies on environmental literacy of students. Three kinds of interactive technologies were compared in the study. Some of the interactive techniques in them were similar; others differed between the experimental groups. Three main interactive technologies were compared: group work in the field and poster presentations, teem work on projects and power point presentations, demonstration and discussion on concept maps in the delivery of a lecture. The project work was the most effective and the presentation of concept maps was the least effective. Neither of them was used independently. They were accompanied by additional techniques, which enhanced their influence.

AB  - Advanced practice nurses must be able to link interventions to address pathophysiological processes with underlying alterations in normal physiological function to promote safe, effective patient care. Development of creative methods to assist students to make their own connections among healthcare concepts is imperative to create a positive learning environment. The authors discuss the use of concept mapping in conjunction with case-study clinical rounds to maximize critical thinking and greater learning retention among advanced practice nurses in a graduate physiology/pathophysiology course.

AB  - Concept matching is important when heterogeneous data sources are to be merged for the purpose of knowledge sharing. It has many useful applications in areas such as schema matching, ontology matching, scientific knowledge management, e-commerce, enterprise application integration, etc. With the desire of knowledge sharing and reuse in these fields, merging commonly occurs among different organizations where the knowledge describing the same domain is to be matched. Due to the different naming conventions, granularity and the use of concepts in different contexts, a semantic approach to this problem is preferred in comparison to syntactic approach that performs matches based upon the labels only. We propose a concept matching method that initially does not consider labels when forming candidate matches, but rather utilizes structural information to take the context into account and detect complex matches. Real world knowledge representations (schemas) are used to evaluate the method. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - This paper explores conceptual variation in the depiction of gene function in upper secondary school textbooks. Historically, concepts in genetics have developed in various scientific frameworks, which has led to a level of incommensurability as concepts have changed over time within their respective frameworks. Since students may have difficulties in understanding concepts where there is implicit variation in descriptions of the same phenomena, we have developed a concept mapping instrument and applied it to study the gene function concepts in biology and chemistry textbooks that are widely used in Sweden, and others used in a selection of English speaking countries. The data were then further examined using content analysis. In the present paper we describe the conceptual variation of gene function as it is presented in the textbooks, and analyze the ways in which students' understanding may be influenced. We conclude that it may be difficult for students to gain a modern, process-oriented understanding of gene function if textbooks are used as foundations for the planning and execution of lessons. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Science assessment in secondary schools requires instruments and techniques that reveal the depth and complexity of students' science understandings and capabilities. Because students' knowledge, reasoning, and skills vary across science domains and contexts, assessments must encompass a range of tasks, formats, and techniques. This article focuses on six types of assessment: question-demonstration assessments, performance assessments, information technologies, conceptual inventories and item clusters, concept maps, and student notebooks. For each of these, distinctive features are outlined; example items are provided; and formative and summative uses are described where applicable. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Several applications of the HyLighter online social annotation system in undergraduate and graduate teacher education broaden and deepen instructional experiences for both students and the professor. Interactive reading and commentary on articles and case studies facilitate comprehension, memory and transfer as students learn from and with each other and the instructor. Collaborative concept mapping integrated with social annotation enables students to synthesize and link course concepts and materials reflecting the big picture of the course. Hypermedia-enhanced and collaboratively developed lesson plans provide an enriching, culminating, collaborative experience which integrates social annotation with course theories, online video and print resources and technology-enhanced, pedagogically sound lessons across the curriculum. These applications are conceptualized using several complementary theoretical frameworks, including Vygotsky's concept of the Zone of Proximal Development where an online collaborative environment creates a virtual learning community which provides scaffolding so that learners reach higher levels of performance. These social annotation practices promote student and teacher metacognition in addition to meaningful learning and transfer. They also enable authentic assessments of student achievement. Students' and teachers' reflections on their own and others' perspectives provide insights which improve both learning and instruction. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2010.

AB  - Knowledge visualization is an emerging field of research which develops on the basis of scientific computing visualization, data visualization and information visualization. In this paper, the concept, formats, and theoretical basis of knowledge visualization are discussed; three kinds of it (concept maps, mind maps, and visual metaphors) and ways of applying them to improve learning effect are commentated. First, two kinds of classification of knowledge visualization are introduced. One distinguished knowledge visualization into six main groups; the other distinguished it into five forms. Then principle of knowledge visualization is analyzed. At last, examples that the three forms of knowledge visualization applied in learning are given, which related to learning effects and reasons of improving learning. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - For beginning teachers to make the transition to full professional membership they need to increase their professional knowledge of the art and science of teaching. This paper explores the difference in knowledge growth between beginning teachers who commence teaching in fragmented teaching situations in the first two years of teaching, and their colleagues who have stable, secure and continuing employment during this time. This paper argues that the employment context in which beginning teachers take up their profession has a significant, but hitherto largely unacknowledged, effect on the capacity of teachers to develop the craft of teaching (Elbaz, 1983); on their continuing commitment to the profession; and on their self-confidence and self-image as teachers It is concluded that long-term, secure employment in one school, with full responsibility for a class of students and access to effective mentoring, is necessary if beginning teachers are to move beyond 'survival' to developing competency in the first two years of teaching. © 2010 Australian Teacher Education Association.

In this paper, we describe the process of creating personas to inform refinements to the design of software designed to help elementary students create concept maps of science topics they were studying. Drawing from interviews with children, parents, and teachers, the aim of these personas was to help the design team develop refinements to help children use the software effectively if it were to be assigned as homework. © ISLS.

AB  - Open-ended assessments, defined as assessments with a large set of possible correct answers, by nature lend themselves to concerns regarding accurate and consistent grading. This article describes one particular open-ended assessment, named Creative Exercises (CE), designed for promoting students' interconnection of concepts in a college general chemistry setting. The article presents evidence concerning several aspects of validity, including the extent scores represent chemistry knowledge and the extent scoring is consistent across three graders. The evidence is also presented in the context of what is known about concept maps, a commonly employed open-ended assessment in chemistry. Implications for the administration of CEs and the appropriateness of measuring students' hierarchical organization of knowledge are also discussed as a result of this comparison. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

AB  - The paper is devoted to the concept map-based intelligent assessment system that promotes students' knowledge self-assessment and supports teachers in improvement of study courses through systematic assessment and analysis of students' knowledge on the basis of concept maps. During the last five years, both the system's functionality and knowledge assessment approach were improved persistently, and at the moment, certain level of maturity is reached in both directions. The paper focuses on general principles of functioning of the last prototype, tasks provided, teachers' and students' support, scoring and adaptation mechanisms. At the end of the paper, retrospection of the system's evolution and evaluation results is provided. Copyright © 2011 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.

AB  - The learning outcome of a physics laboratory course for medical students was examined in an interdisciplinary field study and discussed for the electrical physiology (" Propagation of Excitation and Nerve Cells"). At the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (LMU) at a time about 300 medicine students were assessed in two successive years. Students from the control group worked with standard experiments, while students from the treatment group performed newly developed "addressee-specific" experiments, designed to guide students to transfer physics knowledge to physiological problems. The assessment took place within the laboratory course on physiology, after the students had finished their laboratory classes in physics, and consisted of the construction of a concept map with additional multiple choice questions. The results showed that standard physics experiments are not adequate for teaching students to transfer physical principles to physiology. Introducing new addressee-specific experiments enriched the physics laboratory course by improving student attitudes toward physics and demonstrating better ability of students to relate concepts of physics and medicine, and overall to improve their understanding of the physics taught in the course. © 2010 The American Physical Society.

AB  - Recent advances in mobile and wireless communication technologies have enabled various new learning approaches which situate students in environments that combine real-world and digital-world learning resources; moreover, students are allowed to share knowledge or experiences with others during the learning process. Although such an approach seems to be promising and innovative, researchers have indicated several problems when applying it to practical applications, in particular, the lack of proper strategies or tools to assist the students to learn collaboratively in such a learning scenario with abundant content. Students might feel interested when using the mobile devices to learn; however, without proper assistance or guidance, their learning achievements are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, this study proposes a concept map-oriented Mindtool for collaborative ubiquitous learning. Experimental results from a natural science course in an elementary school show that this approach not only enhances learning motivation but also improves the learning achievements of the students. © 2010 The Authors.

Owing to its dynamic nature, RASI represents a quintessential actor network for weathering science, because it links task in the landscape with an active material practice and an alternative materialistic world-view recently called for in positivistic science, to create place. Using concept maps as an assessment tool, 571 college undergraduate students and 13 junior high school integrated science students (ages 12-13) were evaluated for increased learning potential between pre- and post-field experiences. Further, this article demonstrates that when students use RASI to learn the fundamental complex science of weathering they make in-depth connections between weathering form and process not achieved through traditional, positivistic weathering pedagogy. We argue that RASI draws upon inherent actor networks which allow students to link weathering form and process to an animate conceptualization of landscape. Conceptualizing landscape as sentient actor networks removes weathering science disciplinary connections and their inherent pedagogic practices. Our focus in this paper is not to challenge weathering ontology and epistemology, but rather to argue that there is a need for a pedagogical paradigm shift in weathering science. © The Author(s) 2010.

AB  - Data were gathered from 248 secondary students (14. years old, 56% female) who learned about the circulatory system in 77 self-selected collaborative groups. The learning outcomes of biology students who summarised by collaborative concept mapping were compared with those of students who summarised by collaborative writing. Learning groups randomly assigned to construct concept maps instead of conventional summaries generated more relations in the summary task and their members obtained higher individual scores on a post-test. The concept mapping strategy was found to be advantageous only for students whose cognitive ability was below the median for the sample and who were placed in groups with other students having low cognitive ability. © 2010 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - In this article, I argue for the importance of using specific kinds of concept maps, such as ladders, in a technical writing class offered for computer science majors. This article presents a strong argument that use of concept maps should be effectively integrated both during planning stages and as part of traditional document production techniques. Assignments and activities in a technical writing classroom should address the use of concept maps for conceptualizing, schematizing and presenting procedural information like software documentation, explaining laboratory reports etc. Using concept maps efficiently can lead to structural and functional conceptualization, visualization, representation and retention of complex information. A survey-based study reported in this article suggests that advanced students in an EFL technical thesis writing course in this computer science institute has enough expertise to understand the use and application of specialized concept maps for technical document production activities. Results indicate that students, on most part, understand specialized document-specific, task-specific applications and especially specific sentences in the domain of computer science and self-reports also indicate that they are reasonably confident about their ability to apply ladders in logical ways. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - In this study, we introduced the students to experimenting with and manufacturing of real products. The products are a "Model Car" and a "Walking Model." With this specific objective and using no special equipment, students can learn and utilize mechanics which is one of the fundamental discipline in engineering. We introduced these two products in a lecture format and evaluated the effectiveness of the learning process. Results of the evaluation administered before and after the class showed that the students obtained a greater understanding of mechanics by using the two products. A resulting concept map and survey questionnaire showed that the students had improved their ability to apply scientific knowledge through their practical experiences in experimental and manufacturing processes. Moreover, detailed analyses including factor analysis suggest an improvement in the students' confidence in their scientific knowledge and activities in product making. © 2010 Society for Experimental Mechanics Inc.

AB  - In this study, a parsimonious set of quantities is developed to characterise and evaluate the quality of concept maps. It is shown here how such a set can be based on measurements of the connectivity, clustering and cohesion of concept maps. A structural model of the data is introduced so that concept maps can be evaluated and classified by using only two quantities called here richness of content (D) and quality of structure (q). The model is used in monitoring changes in the concept maps (N=33) consisting of two sets of maps (initial and final ones), made before and after teaching. Such an approach gives access to monitor changes of the concept maps during a teaching sequence.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education has become a key focus in the U.S. government's public education agenda. Many STEM degrees require the successful completion of undergraduate introductory organic chemistry (O-Chem), which is notorious for its difficulty and high attrition rate. Concept Maps (CM) have been used as a tool to improve teaching and learning by providing feedback to teacher and students. Although numerous studies have examined the use of concept maps (CMs) as an assessment tool in science classes, none to date has examined such applications of CMs in O-Chem. Furthermore, studies investigating the validity of CMs in post-secondary science courses are rare. Thus, the present study investigated the validity of CMs as an assessment tool and their diagnostic uses in O-Chem by examining the relationship between CM scores and other key performance measures in O-Chem. Results indicated that CM scores were significantly correlated with problem set scores and final course grade. In addition, a mediation analysis revealed that problem solving scores partially mediated the relationship between problem solving and final course grade, confirming the role CMs are expected to play in O-Chem achievement. Implications for using CMs as diagnostic and formative tools in instruction are discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2011.

AB  - This article introduces the concept of Personal Professional Theories to refer to knowledge development within the context of vocational education. They are personal interpretations of formal theories, work process knowledge and notions about professional attitude in a specific occupational domain, and are assumed to be frames of reference for professional experiences and guides in action simultaneously. To make detecting development in personal professional theories possible, strategies need to be validated for revealing them. Two strategies [i.e., concept mapping (CM) and a combination of CM with stimulated recall (SR)] are compared, by grading them on three aspects of adequacy (i.e., richness, coherence and content), to see which one reveals personal professional theories better. The sample consisted of 16 students of two training courses. Both strategies succeeded in revealing personal professional theories: The constructed maps displayed personal interpretations of formal theories, work process knowledge and notions about professional attitude. However, the concept maps of the combined strategy did worse on all aspects of adequacy. The CM strategy appeared better for revealing personal professional theories. Several explanations are offered, which deserve further investigation. Hence, despite the project's small scale, the outcomes provide in interesting clues to reveal personal professional theories. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A key element of medical competence is problem solving. Previous work has shown that doctors use inductive reasoning to progress from facts to hypotheses and deductive reasoning to move from hypotheses to the gathering of confirmatory information. No individual assessment method has been designed to quantify the use of inductive and deductive procedures within clinical reasoning. The aim of this study was to explore the feasibility and reliability of a new method which allows for the rapid identification of the style (inductive or deductive) of clinical reasoning in medical students and experts. METHODS: The study included four groups of four participants. These comprised groups of medical students in Years 3, 4 and 5 and a group of specialists in internal medicine, all at a medical school with a 6-year curriculum in France. Participants were asked to solve four clinical problems by thinking aloud. The thinking expressed aloud was immediately transcribed into concept maps by one or two 'writers' trained to distinguish inductive and deductive links. Reliability was assessed by estimating the inter-writer correlation. The calculated rate of inductive reasoning, the richness score and the rate of exhaustiveness of reasoning were compared according to the level of expertise of the individual and the type of clinical problem. RESULTS: The total number of maps drawn amounted to 32 for students in Year 4, 32 for students in Year 5, 16 for students in Year 3 and 16 for experts. A positive correlation was found between writers (R = 0.66-0.93). Richness scores and rates of exhaustiveness of reasoning did not differ according to expertise level. The rate of inductive reasoning varied as expected according to the nature of the clinical problem and was lower in experts (41% versus 67%). CONCLUSIONS: This new method showed good reliability and may be a promising tool for the assessment of medical problem-solving skills, giving teachers a means of diagnosing how their students think when they are confronted with clinical problems. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - The ability to appreciate the inter-connectedness of complex biological relationships can be difficult for many students. Graphical knowledge in the form of concept maps and flow charts are learning tools which can assist students to recognise the inter-connectivity. This report focuses on a trial which incorporates these two related visual learning tools using a tablet PC to support their instruction in an undergraduate introductory microbiology class. The objectives of the trial were to introduce both concept maps and flow charts so as to assist students in linking theory with practical knowledge, to make connections within and outside their course of study, and to increase student preparedness and time management in laboratories. An integrated approach to teaching using a pen-based technology with live audio visual in both lectures and laboratories was used. This report details the implementation of the teaching approach focusing on the application of the concept maps and flow charts and how tablet PC technology was incorporated in both settings. The evaluation results of the trial are also reported indicating the impact of the integrated teaching approach on student learning experience and concludes with potential areas for future consideration. © 2011 Society of Biology.

AB  - This exploratory study examined how groups of sixth grade students worked together to create a collaborative concept map. We selected two contrasting cases based on their initial maps, one heterogeneous group with divergent maps and one homogeneous group with convergent maps. We analyzed group dialogue and collaborative and individual concept maps to understand: 1) if convergence of science ideas occurs during collaborative concept mapping and 2) how convergence or divergence during collaboration influences individual map construction. We found that collaborative concept maps facilitated greater convergence of ideas in groups with initially divergent pre individual maps. Further, the negotiation of divergent science ideas during collaboration led to gains in individual students' science understanding. Implications of findings and directions for future research are discussed.

AB  - We have developed Betty's Brain [1], a computer-based learning environment that employs the learning-by-teaching paradigm to foster students' acquisition of science knowledge and self-regulated learning strategies. The system provides students with opportunities for self-directed, open-ended learning in science. In this learning environment, students are given a knowledge construction task in which they teach a virtual agent by engaging in an iterative process of reading source material and structuring their knowledge in a causal concept map for a particular science domain (e.g., ecology or thermo-regulation). The agent, then, can use this map to answer questions and take quizzes. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Aim: This article is intended to be a layman introduction to the methodology commonly used in complexity science studies, emphasizes holistic consideration, description on the entire pattern against bits and pieces of sectional analysis, use of metaphors to build up integration of ostensibly incompatible features such as simultaneous co-existence of land and rivers, hills and valleys in the landscape portraits, a popular tool in complexity studies. The setting of analysis used in this article falls in the arena of recent hot debate on how curriculum on Sustainable Development Education should be designed, a vehicle to illustrate application of Dynamical Systems Theory. Background: Curriculum re-engineering has been around for decades throughout the world; school-based curricula, innovative central curricula, inter-disciplinary projects, to name but a few. Some did not last long because of territorial biases; some made a fad and faded. The irony lay in the immediate demise of projects that claimed a success in their pilot run. We had topics like environment conservation, globalization, followed by global warming infiltrating the classrooms these past years. Now the limelight is on sustainable development. Is it late? That is not the issue. Our main concern is how our innovations may stand out against all odds and survive the times. Discussion: This article depicts application of Chaos theory, Complexity theories and Dynamical Systems Theory to understand how new trades, new academic subjects or new research interests arise and go, and argues that design for sustainable development education should embrace new elements of skills in its curriculum, and has to be inter-disciplinary. The author further argues for inclusion of complexity science elements (a series of superficially independent incidents may attenuate and demise or else, amplify through positive feedback mechanism and surprise the world with revolutionary change). However, the change could never be explained completely without an introduction of time element into the chain of change episodes.

AB  - Our study integrates automated natural language-oriented assessment and analysis methodologies into feasible reading comprehension tasks. With the newly developed T-MITOCAR toolset, prose text can be automatically converted into an association net which has similarities to a concept map. The "text to graph" feature of the software is based on several parsing heuristics and can be used both to assess the learner's understanding by generating graphical information from his or her text and to generate conceptual graphs from text which can be used as learning materials. In this study we investigate the effects of association nets made available to learners prior to reading. The results reveal that the automatically created graphs are highly similar to classical expert graphs. However, neither the association nets nor the expert graphs had a significant effect on learning, although the latter have been reported to have an effect in previous studies. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Objective: To assess whether students find concept mapping a useful learning methodology to conceptualize and organize topics studied in CNS module of Pharmacology; and to evaluate whether addition of concept mapping assignment could help to improve examination scores. Study Design: An analytical study. Place and Duration of Study: College of Dentistry, Jinnah Medical and Dental College, Karachi, Pakistan, from March to May 2009. Methodology: A class of 50 BDS students was recruited for the study. Two randomly selected groups of 12 students each, prepared concept maps in topics from CNS pharmacology which were displayed and discussed during tutorial sessions. The other two groups (n=25) following the traditional teaching methodology, served as controls. Scores from best choice questions and short essay questions were compared between the investigational and control groups using the student's t-test with significance at p < 0.05. Feedback obtained after completion of the study was evaluated as percent response. Results: One-best-choice test of the control group showed a mean grade of 57.1 ± 16.7 vs. test group mean of 58.8 ± 13. For the short essay questions, control group obtained a mean of 52.3 ± 18.8 vs. test group mean grade of 53.8 ± 22.5. Both results were not significantly different (p > 0.05). However, feedback about concept mapping showed that the technique helped the students to conceptualize difficult topics in CNS pharmacology (86.36%). Concept mapping was particularly beneficial in preparing for exams as it provided a quick overview of the entire subject (68.68%). Conclusion: Students found concept mapping as a useful pedagogical tool which could potentially be used to acquire meaningful learning in Pharmacology as a supplement to traditional teaching techniques. It was not found beneficial in improving examination grades probably because standard examinations and concept mapping measure different cognitive domains. © 2011.

AB  - Many research studies have clearly demonstrated the importance of cognitive structures as the building blocks of meaningful learning and retention of instructional materials. Identifying the learners' cognitive structures will help instructors to organize materials, identify knowledge gaps, and relate new materials to existing slots or anchors within the learners' cognitive structures. The purpose of our empirical investigation is to track the development of cognitive structures over time. Accordingly, we demonstrate how various indicators derived from graph theory can be used for a precise description and analysis of cognitive structures. Our results revealed several patterns that helped us to better understand the construction and development of cognitive structures over time. We conclude by identifying applications of our approach for learning and instruction and proposing possibilities for the further development of our approach. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The scientific methodology for capturing, preserving, and sharing knowledge (Hoffman & Lintern, 2006) developed during the era of "expert systems." Today, it takes on special importance with regard to the loss of expertise in knowledge-based organizations, a cohort effect known as the "gray tsunami" (Moon, et al, 2009). Senior leadership at utilities throughout North America cite statistics that 45-65 percent of senior engineers are at or are nearing retirement. The palette of knowledge elicitation (KE) methods includes forms of structured interview, techniques for work analysis of on-the-job performance, and methods for proficiency scaling (Hoffman, et al., 1998; Hoffman & Militello, 2008). Empirical comparisons of KE methods have highlighted their strengths, weaknesses, and appropriate applications (Hoffman, et al., 1995). Certain combinations of methods are particularly useful and efficient for eliciting knowledge that is critical to the organization and remains undocumented ("tacit" knowledge). IHMC researchers, in collaboration with Perigean Technologies LLC, have conducted demonstrations and training workshops on KE with participants at numerous utilities. Knowledge modeling efforts have focused on domains ranging from business relations to steam turbine repair. The KE methods we have used include Concept Mapping and the Critical Decision Method. In this presentation we will describe these methods and will illustrate some of the knowledge models we have developed. An additional focus of our work has been to carry the knowledge capture effort over into training. In collaboration with EPRI, we are converging on a methodology to demonstrate the "accelerated learning" of expertise. We provide recommendations for utilities and nuclear personnel considering knowledge capture efforts.

AB  - University teaching deals with complex and miscellaneous knowledge and higher education should focus on sustained conceptual understanding of relevant topics. Guidance on how to construct adequate knowledge structures can support meaningful learning. But lectures, for instance, often are structured in linear sequence by a number of slides and are thus biased towards linear representations of knowledge that are not appropriate for most scientific disciplines. In this study, a framework for concept maps was developed to complement lectures in human biology online. The course was aimed at student teachers at the undergraduate level. The work is based on recent theoretical research on the use of multimedia in learning environments and e-learning, knowledge structures perspectives of teaching and learning as well as theoretical assumptions of self-determination in educational processes. Each session (14 in total, e.g. human respiratory and circulatory system, physiology of senses, human anatomy) was supplemented by a digital concept map providing relevant concepts connected with linking words and continuative material attached via hyperlinks (e.g. images, web links, animations, video). Following each single lecture, students had free access to the concept maps to reinforce the latest topics and to prepare for the final examination. The objective of the study was to examine if the use of complementary concept maps (i) influences achievement and (ii) motivational variables. The students' (N = 171) concept map use was logged along with a documentation of their achievement and miscellaneous variables regarding their motivation (e.g. interest/ enjoyment, perceived competence, effort/ importance, value/ usefulness). The logfile-data allowed distinguishing learners according to the frequency and duration of their concept map use. Additionally, computer-related self-efficacy was documented as a moderating factor. Results reveal the benefit of additional concept maps for achievement and positive motivational aspects, moderating factors are discussed. The emphasize of further research should be on students' active engagement in structuring their individual learning by constructing adequate concept maps themselves, especially in science education courses. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Although concept maps have been found to be effective in science education research, these are critiqued for being informal due to informal usage of relation and attribute names thereby resulting in ambiguity. Refined concept mapping, a development over the regular concept mapping is an approach towards introducing rigor and parsimony in representing knowledge. The method proposed suggests to substitute the ambiguous relation names with well-defined relation names to concepts consistently while mapping a domain. We suggest the use of this method for introducing rigor in concept mapping and position it among the other models of knowledge representation in an inverse semantic spectrum. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - For collaboration in learning situations, it is important to know what the collaborators know. However, developing such knowledge is difficult, especially for newly formed groups participating in a computer-supported collaboration. The solution for this problem described in this paper is to provide to group members access to the knowledge structures and the information resources of their collaboration partners in the form of digital concept maps. In an empirical study, 20 triads having access to such maps and 20 triads collaborating without such maps are compared regarding their group performance in problem-solving tasks. Results showed that the triads being provided with such concept maps acquired more knowledge about the others' knowledge structures and information, focused while collaborating mainly on problem-relevant information, and therefore, solved the problems faster and more often correctly, compared to triads with no access to their collaborators' maps. © 2010 International Society of the Learning Sciences, Inc.; Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The widespread availability of digital learning resources in a variety of media formats has promoted the proliferation of eLearning systems as an integral part of teaching across all sectors of education. However, these systems are rarely planned in advance taking into account its final usefulness. At most, they are validated through learner experience using the final implemented system. In this paper, a scientific technique called concept mapping is proposed to identify the external variables that should be kept in mind while designing an eLearning tool. As a result, improvements can be programmed to increase its utility in the teaching activities prior to its use. The method has been tested in the development of a eLearning system used for advanced microprocessor teaching. Results are shown through two-dimensional maps, in which variables can be seen as clusters or groups of ideas. These variables can be used as a guide for developing an eLearning tool. The reliability of the results is also analyzed to check the correct application of the proposed technique. © 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The purpose of this paper is to present results from an interdisciplinary design course that utilized an inquiry-based approach to guide students in producing "smart" safety equipment for firefighters. This study explores the benefits and challenges of promoting interdisciplinarity through self-managed teaming. The participants included 12 students in an interdisciplinary capstone design course, with 4 each from electrical and computer engineering, industrial design, and marketing. The course was designed so that students self-managed their teams in an inquiry-based learning mode with the objective of designing safety equipment for firefighters that utilizes "smart" technology. The researchers observed and video-recorded each class and administered the Team Diagnostic Survey and concept map activities. Results indicated that students benefited from the self-managed teaming and also encountered various challenges in this project-based course, but they were able to succeed in both product design and crossing disciplinary boundaries. Recommendations for interdisciplinary teaming pedagogy are discussed. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The learner selects and transforms information, constructs hypotheses and makes decisions, relying on a cognitive structure that provides meaning and organization to experiences and allows the individual to go beyond. Quantitative data regarding concepts formed about global warming and ozone depletion was obtained through a questionnaire administered to 280 Maltese post-secondary students, who had already attended Environmental Science lessons. In depth group interviews were performed with four focus groups to elucidate underlying reasoning. Besides the presence of lacunae in their knowledge, the study revealed that students formulated their own logical, but sometimes incorrect, frameworks through which they could explain the issues. Concept maps elicited from the data show how students erroneously linked global warming to ozone depletion and stratospheric ozone to tropospheric ozone. Recommendations are made on how learners can think how an expert of that particular knowledge domain would think in that particular circumstance.

The study sample consisted of 60 graduate students grouped into one experimental and one control group. For the experimental group, the physiological courses (Teaching Area: Nervous System) were carried out using programmed instruction, which was performed using computer and programmed materials containing the concept maps. The control group at the same facility implemented the classical-lecturing teaching. After elaborating on the teaching material, a survey was conducted for students of the experimental group. The survey results show a great interest by students in the programmed model of teaching and reported high motivation for adopting physiological programming content using such a didactic model.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that allows for the strengthening of the learning process, based on graphic representations of the learner's mental schemes. However, due to its graphic nature, it cannot be utilized by learners with visual disabilities. In response to this limitation we implemented a study that involves the design of AudiodMC, an audio-based, virtual environment for concept mapping designed for use by blind users and aimed at virtual training and rehabilitation. We analyzed the stages involved in the design of AudiodMC from a user-centered design perspective, considering user involvement and usability testing. These include an observation stage to learn how blind learners construct conceptual maps using concrete materials, a design stage to design of a software tool that aids blind users in creating concept maps, and a cognitive evaluation stage using AudiodMC. We also present the results of a study implemented in order to determine the impact of the use of this software on the development of essential skills for concept mapping (association, classification, categorization, sorting and summarizing). The results point to a high level of user acceptance, having identified key sound characteristics that help blind learners to learn concept codification and selection skills. The use of AudiodMC also allowed for the effective development of the skills under review in our research, thus facilitating meaningful learning. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - In recent years, academics and educators have begun to use software mapping tools for a number of education-related purposes. Typically, the tools are used to help impart critical and analytical skills to students, to enable students to see relationships between concepts, and also as a method of assessment. The common feature of all these tools is the use of diagrammatic relationships of various kinds in preference to written or verbal descriptions. Pictures and structured diagrams are thought to be more comprehensible than just words, and a clearer way to illustrate understanding of complex topics. Variants of these tools are available under different names: "concept mapping", "mind mapping" and "argument mapping". Sometimes these terms are used synonymously. However, as this paper will demonstrate, there are clear differences in each of these mapping tools. This paper offers an outline of the various types of tool available and their advantages and disadvantages. It argues that the choice of mapping tool largely depends on the purpose or aim for which the tool is used and that the tools may well be converging to offer educators as yet unrealised and potentially complementary functions. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Too often neglected to the detriment of therapeutic patient education (TPE), emotions occupy a fundamental place in pedagogy. They deserve to be explored more deeply. Objective: This empirical, qualitative study tests the feasibility of a new technique to elicite and highlighten emotions liked to knowledge organization. Methods: In this study, the patient creates a structure referred to as a "concept map/emotion map" (CM-EM) starting from a concept mapping activity. The emotion map is composed of symbols and colors. The technique is tested on 13 adolescents ranging from 11 to 15 year old, with a range of pathologies (cystic fibrosis, diabetes, asthma). The patients are treated in various health care facilities in the city of Nantes. The opinions of patients and observers are solicited to identify the advantages and limitations of this method. Results: The maps themselves and interviews with adolescents and caregivers show the effectiveness of the method for revealing the patients' emotions patients. We also describe its educational limitations. Conclusion: At this stage of the study, the CM-EM permits a patient to better understand the emotions evoked by his/her illness, and to communicate to the caregiver the nature and intensity of his/her emotions linked to his/her knowledge organization. In return, and this is a new hypothesis, eliciting and highlighting emotions could modify the knowledge organization. © EDP Sciences, SETE, 2010.

AB  - Using visual models is common in science and should become more common in classrooms. Our research group has developed and completed studies on the use of a visual modeling tool, the Concept Connector. This modeling tool consists of an online concept mapping Java applet that has automatic scoring functions we refer to as Robograder. The Concept Connector enables students in large introductory science courses to visualize their thinking through online model building. The Concept Connector's flexible scoring system, based on tested grading schemes as well as instructor input, has enabled >1,000 physiology students to build maps of their ideas about plant and animal physiology with the guidance of automatic and immediate online scoring of homework. Criterion concept maps developed by instructors in this project contain numerous expert-generated or "correct" propositions connecting two concept words together with a linking phrase. In this study, holistic algorithms were used to test automated methods of scoring concept maps that might work as well as a human grader. © 2011 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - Scientific literacy can be considered as a new demand of post-industrial society. It seems necessary in order to foster education for sustainability throughout students' academic careers. Universities striving to teach sustainability are being challenged to integrate a holistic perspective into a traditional undergraduate curriculum, which aims at specialization. This new integrative, inter- and transdisciplinary epistemological approach is necessary to cultivate autonomous citizenship, i.e., that each citizen be prepared to understand and participate in discussions about the complex contemporary issues posed by post-industrial society. This paper presents an epistemological framework to show the role of scientific literacy in fostering education for sustainability. We present a set of 26 collaborative concept maps (CCmaps) in order to illustrate an instance of theory becoming practice. During a required course for first-year undergraduate students (ACH 0011, Natural Sciences), climate change was presented and discussed in broad perspective by using CCmaps. We present students' CCmaps to show how they use concepts from quantitative and literacy disciplines to deal with the challenges posed by the need of achieving a sustainable development. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Learning how to express a matrix using a keyboard inputs requires a lot of time for most of college students. Therefore, for a problem based learning system for linear algebra to be accessible for college students, it is inevitable to develop a simple method for expressing matrices. Studying the two most widely used input methods for expressing matrices, a simpler input method for expressing matrices is obtained. Furthermore, using this input method and educator's knowledge structure as a concept map, a problem based learning system for linear algebra which is capable of assessing students' knowledge structure and skill is developed. © 2011 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - This case study draws attention to Pedro's story, a Grade 6 Latino teacher who, along with other grade 4-6 teachers, participated in a three-year professional development research project. By using data analyzed from multiple ethnographic interviews with teachers and students, and by drawing from the quantitative analyzes of concept map unit tests, we illustrate how Pedro's significant professional growth and his students' learning were truncated by top-down school district policies. These policies were implemented because of the punitive nature of the No Child Left Behind Act. Simply put, this case study exposes the impact of opp(reg)ressive policies on learning, that is, policies simultaneously oppressive and regressive. The critical perspective of the project, and its emphasis on assisting teachers to make their pedagogy and curriculum more culturally and socially relevant, was informed by sociotransformative constructivism (sTc). This is a theoretical framework that affords equal importance to cross-cultural education (learning about and acting on socially/culturally relevant issues) and social constructivism (learning to critically produce and consume knowledge). We hope that this case study will provide additional insights into the slow progress we continue to make in science teacher professional development and in closing the achievement gap. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Concept maps are metacognitive study tools created and used by learners as reference maps describing relationships between concepts and specific domains. The purpose of this study was to investigate any correlation between the quality of concept maps and the mark distributions in a first-year engineering biology course. Major concepts of the course included prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell structure and composition, metabolic pathways, cell transport, genetic engineering and growth kinetics. Students were asked to develop concept maps and were allowed to consult their maps in a portion of the final exam. Maps were assigned a qualitative grouping of 1 (incomplete, preliminary map) or 2 (complete map) and were associated with final exam grades to compare the effectiveness of the concept maps. Students who provided complete concept maps had significantly higher 'open book' portion grades (p < 0.0001) and overall final exam grades (p < 0.0001) than students who handed in preliminary maps. The quality of the concept map was positively correlated to student performance in questions requiring conceptual skills as well as in the overall final exam grade. © 2011 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Often computer simulation environments present students with an idealized version of the real world which can affect students' conceptual understanding. In this study we investigate the effects of completing an experiment in mechanics using this ideal world as compared to an identical experiment in the real world. Students in three of five conceptual physics laboratory sections completed the physical experiment while the other two sections performed the virtual experiment. The experiments were part of a unit on simple machines from the CoMPASS curriculum [1] which integrates hypertext-based concept maps in a design-based context. There was no statistically significant difference between the pre and post data of the students in the two groups. Students who performed the virtual experiment were able to answer questions dealing with work and potential energy more correctly, though neither group was able to offer sound reasoning to support their answers. © 2010 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - We propose a new method to support educational exploration in the hyperlink network of the Wikipedia online encyclopedia. The learner is provided with alternative parallel ranking lists, each one promoting hyperlinks that represent a different pedagogical perspective to the desired learning topic. The learner can browse the conceptual relations between the latest versions of articles or the conceptual relations belonging to consecutive temporal versions of an article, or a mixture of both approaches. Based on her needs and intuition, the learner explores hyperlink network and meanwhile the method builds automatically concept maps that reflect her conceptualization process and can be used for varied educational purposes. Initial experiments with a prototype tool based on the method indicate enhancement to ordinary learning results and suggest further research. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The theory of intuition learning is briefly reviewed and a model of the learning process is presented. The paper then discusses and characterizes an Interactive Intuition Learning System (IILS) and its relationship to experiential learning and learning pattern. From the initial intuition decision system defined by the experience judgment, a series of learning interval-systems with various experience levels are created. Firstly, human intuitive decision making gotten by the learning approach of self-organization of intuition decision processing, and the concept mapping of selection of knowledge and experience is established by artificial intuition method based on the decision trait of human intuition. Finally, an artificial intuition method combined with self-organization method of intuition computing is proposed according to the amelioration of the intuition computing. Experiment proves that the Intuition Concept Space and the interactive mapping intuition pattern inversion (IMIPI) approach are feasible. A prototype for a intuition learning environment designed and built by the author is then discussed along with its application in the design of a crime analysis for learning electrical circuits. © 2010 ACADEMY PUBLISHER.

AB  - With the increasing volume of learning resources on the Web, the need for automatic mechanism for extracting knowledge has become more critical. The aim of this paper is to propose an approach that can automatically construct directed semantic relationships between concepts to help teachers or students efficiently retrieve appropriate knowledge from the Web. The most distinctive characteristic of this approach is its support for constructing with expandable query. This characteristic addresses the problem of users with varying backgrounds. Working with semantically similar expanded terms allows them to filter out irrelevant terms and focus on corresponding contexts. In addition, we design two learning tasks to show that how this the constructed DSR graph can be used to scaffold students' semantic reasoning. The case study suggests relevant benefits of applying semantic technologies in an educational context. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.

AB  - This paper stands up as an argument for a broadening of the methods used in the science teaching process. The main goal of the authors is to point out ways of achieving learning excellence by usage of modern educational means. This bold aim can be reached by resorting to concept maps within the teaching and evaluation processes. We focus upon the advantages of this method taking as an example a Harmonic Oscillation Motion concept map.

AB  - Concept maps were used as a tool to solve problems in earth science and as a way to help students organize their ideas as a part of a three-part model, Real Engagement in Active Problem Solving (REAPS). Concept maps also were used to augment the National Science Foundation's (NSF) program — Full Option Science System (FOSS) for 3rd grade elementary students. We used two methods of assessment, Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997) and Novak & Gowin (1984). The results of the pre-post concept map assessment demonstrated that the students increased their content knowledge. Both the Novak and Ruiz-Primo methods showed an increase in accuracy of relationships and complexity of understanding of earth materials pre to post instruction. We also showed that the REAPS model enhanced the teacher's ability to teach the FOSS Earth Materials Unit and at the same time meet the Arizona State Standards in science and other non-science standards such as art, through model building. We concluded that to facilitate the use of concept maps in the classroom, teachers need more training and a simplified scoring system so they can easily score their students' progress when doing concept maps. From the practical point of view, we consider that more training and incorporation of practical activities is needed to prepare the students for concept mapping. Further research is needed to examine these possibilities. © 2011 A B Academic Publishers Printed in Great Britain.

AB  - This study firstly notices that lack of overall ecologic knowledge structure is one critical reason for learners' failure of keyword search. Therefore in order to identify their current interesting sight, the dynamic location-aware and semantic hierarchy (DLASH) is presented for learners to browse images. This hierarchy mainly considers that plant and animal species are discontinuously distributed around the planet, hence this hierarchy combines location information for constructing the semantic hierarchy through WordNet. After learners confirmed their intent information needs, this study also provides learners three kinds of image-based learning tasks to learn: similar-images comparison, concept map fill-out and placement map fill-out. These tasks are designed based on Ausubel's advance organizers and improved it by integrating three new properties: Displaying the nodes of the concepts by authentic images, automatically generating the knowledge structure by computer and interactively integrating new and old knowledge. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The "collage effect" occurs when participants in a collaborative learning environment post non-collaborative contributions to a shared workspace, as opposed to contributions that are co-constructive. The resulting artifacts become a collage of individual contributions that do not fully engage the participants in the collaborative learning process. Most online, asynchronous collaborative tools only allow participants to participate with textual interactions, which discourage co-construction in ways discussed in the paper. Graphical tools could provide better affordances for co-construction. HTML provides little support to represent interactive graphical elements in online environments. However, with SVG and AJAX, we can create interactive graphical tools in an online environment. Using SVG and AJAX, we implemented concept maps in an online learning environment called MapCourse. We used MapCourse in several different asynchronous online assignments in two different courses. Our analyses suggest that concept maps encourage more co-constructive contributions than wikipages. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - We examined whether the addition of graphical cues on a concept map could promote self-regulated learning with online materials. College-aged students were provided with concept map visualizations to guide revisions of a scientific essay. These visualizations varied in their use of two graphical cues: color-coded nodes that indicated error types and size-scaled nodes that indicated the importance of domain ideas. Metacognitive strategies were assessed using students’ self-reported visualization use and essay changes. Learning was assessed via true/false items, short answer questions, and self-generated concept maps. Results indicated that color-coding promoted better revision strategies, and both graphical cues supported deeper understanding of domain content compared to a typical concept map display. Implications are discussed for visual display designs that provide meaningful feedback during online learning. © CogSci 2011.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of students' concept mapping on their physics achievement and attitudes toward physics lesson. Participants were 58 ninth-grade students from the two classes enrolled to general physics course in a high school in Turkey. One of the classes was randomly chosen as experimental group (28), constructed electricity concept map and the other was control (30) group, did not receive any presentation on concept mapping. Data were collected via the pre- and post-administration of the Physics Achievement Electricity Test (PAET) and Concept Maps Attitude Scale towards Physics (CMASTP). The study conducted in six weeks in a class that met two times a week. The material covered was about electricity. Results showed that while there were no significant differences in the attitude and achievement between the experimental and control groups. However, the experimental group students were observed to have a tendency of more positive attitude than the control group students. Results also showed that drawing concept map instruction was more effective than traditional instruction in improving physics achievement of the participating students. © 2010 Academic Journals.

AB  - Introduction. We examine relationships between information literacy and information ecology with regard to conceptual innovation in information science. We aim to expand our understanding of human information behaviour and relevance assessment in the electronic environment. Method. Conceptual analysis and conceptual mapping is used and relationships of main concepts are determined in a concept map. Earlier empirical research on information behaviour styles and relevance assessment using surveys and interviews are synthesized. Analysis. Two information styles (pragmatic and analytic) are characterized. Relevance assessment in the electronic environment is analysed. Relevance is considered as part of information literacy. Examples of students' information horizons and a concept map of relevance are given. Results. Ecological dimensions of information literacy are determined at semantic (relevance), visual (information horizon, concept maps) and behavioural and social levels (information styles). A model of ecological dimensions of information literacy is outlined based on triangle of values, tools and communities. Recommendations for development of students' information literacy are presented at levels of information seeking and relevance assessment. Conclusions Implications for information literacy development in the electronic environments and for information and educational strategies are derived. Relevance assessment should be actively trained as part of information literacy and guided inquiry. Ecological dimensions of information literacy can be used in new models of e-learning and digital libraries.

AB  - This paper seeks to develop a methodology that will discover, specify and measure students' abilities and skills in creating concept maps. Because competencies are the key factor in higher education, the paper analyzes the role of concept maps as a tool to diagnose and improve information analysis, synthesis, organization and representation skills and competencies. We propose a methodology that enables these skills to be evaluated by observing, analyzing and measuring the stages involved in creating a concept map: identification of the main and secondary subjects; subject codification by concepts; grading of concepts; and representation of the concepts and their relationships with labels. A case study using action research methodology tests its usefulness on a group of university students of library and information science. The method proposed provides information on the strengths and weaknesses of the students' skills, thus enabling their training to be improved by means of specific actions. © The Author(s), 2010.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique used to provide a visual representation of an individual's ideas about a concept or set of related concepts. This paper describes a concept mapping tool using a photograph association technique (CoMPAT) that is considered to be a novel way of eliciting children's ideas. What children at 11 years of age know about particular concepts related to microbial activity is presented and discussed in relation to the effectiveness of CoMPAT as a tool to draw out their ideas. It is proposed that this tool could be used to explore ideas about this and other science concepts from children in other age groups, and where language may be a barrier to participation. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in a non-programming manner. In this work, we examine the use of the peer review process in early, object-oriented, computer science courses as a way to develop the reviewers' knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation. To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in two CS2 classes at local universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding exercises), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs. Overall, peer reviews are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented programming concepts. Copyright 2010 ACM.

AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for nontraditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study examines the process by which system thinking perceptions develop within the context of a water cycle curriculum. Four junior high school students undergoing an especially designed inquiry-based intervention were closely observed before, during, immediately after, and 6 years after completing a year long systems-based learning program. The employed research tools included observations, semi-structured interviews, and a number of "concept viewing" tools (drawings, concept maps, and repertory grids). Out of the data, four distinct "stories," each presenting a different way of constructing hydro system mental models, are described. The paper's main conclusion is that students develop their systems mental models and remember the learned material based on learning patterns that tend to remain unchanged over time. Consequently, in order to facilitate efficient and lasting construction of students' system models, learning experiences should harness these, and especially the meta-cognitive learning pattern, which holds special significance for constructing systems.

AB  - Management of unstructured information, such as emails, is vital for supporting knowledge work in professional services. However, the conventional way for managing unstructured information is inadequate as the knowledge work and associated tasks are becoming more complex, are dynamically changing with time and involve multiple concepts. This paper attempts to address the inadequacy, deficiency and limitations of the methods presently used to elicit knowledge from masses of unstructured information. These methods rely heavily on manpower, are time consuming and costly. With the development of a multi-faceted and automatic knowledge elicitation system (MAKES) manpower, time and cost can be dramatically reduced. The MAKES integrates the processes of collecting data, classifying unstructured information, modelling knowledge flow and social network analysis, and makes all of these actions into a connected process to audit unstructured information automatically. This audit is based on specific search criteria, search keywords, and the user behaviours of the knowledge workers. The unstructured information is automatically organized, classified and presented in a multi-facet taxonomy map. New concepts and knowledge are uncovered, analyzed and updated continuously from the incoming unstructured information, using a purpose-built knowledge elicitation algorithm named self-associated concept mapping (SACM). The capability and advantages of the MAKES are demonstrated through a successful trial implementation and a verification test conducted in an electronics trading company. Encouraging results have been achieved and a number of potential advantages have been realized. The area of application in this first deployment is based on an email-intensive organization and the proposed study will contribute to the advancement of methods and tools for managing other kinds of unstructured information. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Many higher education faculty members find themselves with the opportunity or requirement to design a new course, or to redesign existing courses or programs. In such situations they have a number of options for how to proceed, but may be unaware of these options. And despite the recommendations and examples provided by organizations such as the Mathematical Association of America, we lack objective guidelines for making curricular decisions and for evaluating potential curricular changes. Additional complications are encountered in the hard sciences, where evaluation of hypotheses typically occurs only after rigorous experimentation. With many curriculum experiments resulting in ambiguous or anecdotal data or lacking data whatsoever, we are faced with making decisions under a great deal of uncertainty. In this chapter, we will discuss five models for curriculum development that are founded on different concepts of the learning experience. Each is unique in its approach and each pairs with different types of learning goals and objectives. Like all curriculum models, these are an attempt to share with students some underlying knowledge structure, a structure that is essentially a mathematical object known as a graph or network. They can be generated through a kind of mind map or concept map and possess complex inter-relations among the components which often require a three-dimensional model to fully visualize. To construct any curriculum then requires that we take this complex structure in three spatial dimensions and project it into a single temporal dimension so that students can experience the curriculum over time. This projection is not unique, except for the simplest of knowledge structures. Thus, all decisions about curriculum development become equivalent to a single geometric question: How do we choose the best projection from which to view the curriculum? An alternative approach, the one taken in this chapter, is to go beyond a fixed curriculum or static projection to expose students to a hyperlinked curriculum. Rather than hiding the complexity of knowledge and its connections to the students, the hyperlinked curriculum is generated by students under the constraints, guidance, and support of teachers and in collaboration with others. These teachers are in turn supported by each other, linked together by administrators who seek to guarantee appropriate opportunities for all learners. © 2010 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - Educators rely heavily on learning activities that encourage elaborative studying, whereas activities that require students to practice retrieving and reconstructing knowledge are used less frequently. Here, we show that practicing retrieval produces greater gains in meaningful learning than elaborative studying with concept mapping. The advantage of retrieval practice generalized across texts identical to those commonly found in science education. The advantage of retrieval practice was observed with test questions that assessed comprehension and required students to make inferences. The advantage of retrieval practice occurred even when the criterial test involved creating concept maps. Our findings support the theory that retrieval practice enhances learning by retrieval-specific mechanisms rather than by elaborative study processes. Retrieval practice is an effective tool to promote conceptual learning about science.

AB  - A major improvement in knowledge processes involving better specification of knowledge contents, structures and interlinking is required by present increase, in complexity as well as in depth, of the learning, the research and development (R&D) process, and also of the development of competences process. Concept mapping allows the identification of concepts inside a specific knowledge area and represents such concepts in a hierarchical and relational architecture. Concepts and groups of related concepts are the basic elements of conceptual geological models applied to finding and producing petroleum. Concept maps of the petroleum geology knowledge area were designed following levels of concept specification: petroleum geology, petroleum system, reservoir system, reservoir modelling and the like. The concept maps may be interlinked. Links of concepts with contents such as texts, figures, presentations, homepages and others may be pointed. Concept maps of petroleum geology may be continuously improved and detailed, according to knowledge identification and evolution.

AB  - This study examines use of knowledge space theory as a novel method of analyzing concept maps. Concept mapping is a technique for expressing relationships between ideas, using two-dimensional node-link diagrams to visually display relationships between ideas. We introduced concept mapping as a voluntary exercise in an upper-level undergraduate immunology course. The students were assigned ten concept maps (for which concept lists were provided) at intervals during the semester-long course. We utilized knowledge space theory (Folmagne & Doignon, 1988) to systematically analyze and compare concept maps drawn by students to their instructor's "expert" concept maps. Using this novel analysis method, we were able to reveal students' level of understanding of course material, changes in student knowledge across time, as well as identify students' alternative conceptions. We found knowledge space theory a productive tool for systematically analyzing and comparing students' concept maps across time and to expert's concept maps.

AB  - The purpose of this cross-age study is to determine that whether the development of the chemistry concept throughout history has similarities with the students' conceptual development of "chemistry" in different grades. The study was carried out with a cross-sectional research in the form of a case study. According to the findings, chemistry concept is constructed in students' minds related to their grades. There is a direct relationship between the construction and the historical development of the concept. In order to overcome misconceptions about the "chemistry" concept and to teach it meaningfully concept mapping, prediction-observation-explanation, interviews about concepts, drawings, fortune lines, relational diagrams and word association techniques are suggested for teachers. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - The development of understanding in the discipline of security science is just beginning. As the academic research on defining the domain of security science continues, so does the development of learning security-related concepts in the understanding of the knowledge structure. This study has considered a methodology for the portrayal of knowledge structures in the domain of electronic security and its associated concepts. It seeks to examine the understanding of novice learners perceptions of electronic security concepts through the knowledge structure approach. The multi-dimensional scaling technique has been applied to dissimilarity measures on a selection of concepts from the domain of electronic security. These concepts were considered as key ideas in the learning of electronic security. The formal knowledge structure for electronic security concepts was mapped for an expert group that was most familiar with the understanding of this domain of security science. In addition, two student groups from the Singapore Institute of Technical Education participated in the study, and produced concept maps for the same electronic security concepts. The structures of the novice groups when compared to the expert group lacked the definition of clusters of related concepts, and were interpreted as lacking the understanding of experts in this knowledge domain. © 2011 Macmillan Publishers Ltd.

AB  - This abstract describes ongoing research on human to human interaction between early career Computer Scientists as they explore a complex collaborative concept mapping task performed by a collocated group using a large wall-screen projected display. We have investigated the effects of input configuration and mode of input on human to human computer interaction through the use of gesture based controllers. Application of Bales' Interaction Process Analysis (IPA) [1] supports identity trade offs in choosing from a plethora of available input devices and displays when investigating interaction and knowledge discovery. Increasingly, Higher Educational departments are encouraged to plan and deploy technologies that facilitate interaction as a fundamental principle of moving into the Interaction Age, specifically 'new tools are needed to support informal learning activities, in particular processes associated with conceptual development' [2]. This need for new tools resulted in the creation of WiiDraw; software through which single or multiple users could interact with and manipulate conceptual mapping diagrams using gestural interaction concurrently. Gaming interfaces like the Nintendo Wii provide options for creating gesture-based input beyond the move-click capability of a mouse, offering new modes to groups who interact with and create conceptual knowledge with large screens. Other example systems have used mouse input [3] and laser pointers [4] as a means through which to explore large-screen based systems, yet none of these have emerged as a clear choice for a range of applications, and there may not be a single best fit option. However, we now present a study of eleven groups who completed a conceptual mapping task on a shared wall-display to determine how the configuration and mode of input influenced the amount of interaction. The experiment consisted of a single between-groups factor of input configuration of two levels (one controller and two controllers) and a single within-groups factor of interaction style, consisting of two levels (controller with no gestures enabled and controller with gestures enabled). IPA was applied to the data that was obtained from video recordings made of each experiment. ANOVA indicated a main effect of number of controllers, F(1,18)=6.38, p=0.02, with a higher number of interactions when dyads had one controller (M=432, SD=93) than two controllers (M=310, SD=140). A main effect of gestures was evident, F(1,18)=5.08, p=0.04 with more interactions occurring with gestures (M=420, SD=119), than without (M=310, SD=129) (see Figure 1). The interaction effect was not statistically significant. Results indicate that one controller afforded higher levels of human to human interaction, with gestures also increasing the number of interactions seen. Further analysis describes the differences in type of interaction and its impact upon knowledge discovery. However it appears Wii interact more when gesturing with concepts. Copyright 2010 ACM.

AB  - The Mechanics of Materials course is fundamental to all areas of solid mechanics in engineering. It is commonly a "gatekeeper" course and generally considered "difficult" by students. Educators across several engineering disciplines have attempted to improve learning through efforts such as: developing physical demonstration models for classroom use, writing computer programs for independent learning, and conducting concept inventory studies to uncover the underlying cause of learning difficulty. This paper describes the development of a Concept Map for Mechanics of Materials. The map serves as the focal point for discussions and questions, and is simple enough so that anyone can re-create its salient features as a hand-drawn sketch. This concept map has been used and assessed as a tool to review the Mechanics of Materials course before administering a gateway exam in the next-level course, and as a tool for the Fundamentals of Engineering Exam review course. Preliminary assessment results indicate this concept map is an effective tool to use for teaching or reviewing Mechanics of Materials. © 2010 IEEE.

AB  - The handheld computer as a pedagogical tool has the capacity to enable students to demonstrate understanding through different modes of representations, for example, verbal, text, tables and graph, drawings, writing or written formulas, concept mapping and animations through Flash or Pocket Slides PowerPoint. Its impact as a motivational learning tool has been described in numerous articles. The purpose of this chapter is to describe its use as a research tool for capturing students' thinking processes as they construct representations in science and mathematics, or solve problems in these learning areas on the handheld. By using an avi-screen capture software operating in the background to do this, the research is a non-intrusive method of capturing the verbal and screen-based (visual) elements of students' thinking as they use the handhelds to complete individual or collaborative tasks. © 2011, IGI Global.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using teacher generated concept maps on the learning of linear motion concepts in physics. The study used a pre and post-test quasi-experimental design method with a control group. The experimental group (n= 28) was taught physics with the aids of concept maps that were generated by the teacher while the control group (n= 29) was taught using the conventional method without concept maps. The results show that students using concept maps are more active in class and obtain a statistically significantly higher gain scores on the physics test (x=17.3) compared to the non-concept mapping group (x=12.9) with p < 0.05. It is concluded that teacher generated concept maps is an effective teaching and learning tool for promoting concept learning of linear motion in physics.

AB  - Motivated by a long-term goal in education for measuring Taiwanese civic scientific literacy in media (SLiM), this work reports the detailed techniques to efficiently mine a concept map from 2 years of Chinese news articles (901,446 in total) for SLiM instrument development. From the Chinese news stories, key terms (important words or phrases), known or new to existing lexicons, were first extracted by a simple, yet effective, rule-based algorithm. They were subjected to an association analysis based on their co-occurrence in sentences to reveal their term-to-term relationship. A given list of 3657 index terms from science textbooks were then matched against the term association network. The resulting term network (including 95 scientific terms) was visualized in a concept map to scaffold the instrument developers. When developing an item, the linked term pair not only suggests the topic for the item due to the clear context being mutually reinforced by each other, but also the content itself because of the rich background provided by the recurrent snippets in which they co-occur. In this way, the resulting instrument (comprised of 50 items) reflect the scientific knowledge revealed in the daily news stories, meeting the goal for measuring civic scientific literacy in media. In addition, the concept map mined from the texts served as a convenient tool for item classification, developer collaboration, and expert review and discussion. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Inspired by a recent surge to understand social cognitive processes in collaborative knowledge building, we have devised an experiment in which students learned from contents of a wiki. One of the informative results we observed was a dissociation between implicit and explicit memory measures that we used to track student's learning: an association test, and the drawing of concept maps, respectively. We put these initial results in the context of experimental research in cognitive psychology and show how the co-evolution model (Cress and Kimmerle, 2008) could account for them. With several network measures, we also suggest some ways of how to measure assimilation and accommodation, both in internal and external knowledge representations. © 2011 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - Concept maps are commonly used as knowledge representation mechanisms to classify a given domain in the scope of a constructivist knowledge building process. In this paper we carry out social constructivist learning experiences using concept maps as a collaborative knowledge-sharing tool with applications in the coordination of virtual communities for learning. In our experiment, the community studies an environmental area-theoretically and in-situ, collects data from a variety of experiments and makes a representation of it. Then, they build a common concept map representing their understanding of this area using a set of tools developed ad-hoc and integrated by a metamodel wrapping approach. Finally, they complete it linking their node with the collected information as a way to organize and to navigate through the different pieces of knowledge that they have been accumulating during several fieldtrips. © 2011 IEEE.

AB  - One valuable goal of instructional technologies in K-12 education is to prepare students for future learning. Two classroom studies examined whether Teachable Agents (TA) achieves this goal. TA is an instructional technology that draws on the social metaphor of teaching a computer agent to help students learn. Students teach their agent by creating concept maps. Artificial intelligence enables TA to use the concept maps to answer questions, thereby providing interactivity, a model of thinking, and feedback. Elementary schoolchildren learning science with TA exhibited "added-value" learning that did not adversely affect the "basic-value" they gained from their regular curriculum, despite trade-offs in instructional time. Moreover, TA prepared students to learn new science content from their regular lessons, even when they were no longer using the software. © 2010 Association for Educational Communications and Technology.

AB  - Abstract The process of transforming students from novices into experts relies on active learning and the development of an appreciation for the links among topics. Since rote or stimulus-response learning is preferred by a majority of students who are beginning their programs of study but does not optimize learning and understanding, the first step in the process is changing students' preference to active learning. As students progress from 100- to 400-level courses, this outcome can be accomplished by reducing the amount of class time that instructors dedicate to lectures that introduce new material and increasing the amount of time dedicated to active learning strategies. Because of PowerPoint's linear structure, teachers can foster learning by supplementing traditional slides with tables, charts, graphs, and concept maps that explicate the links among topics. Concept maps also lend themselves to assessing students' mastery of concepts and the value added by class discussions. Both measures enable instructors to enhance their teaching effectiveness and, over time, use class sessions more efficiently. Copyright © American Political Science Association 2010.

AB  - Multiple intelligences theory (MIT) which takes into account students' individual differences has an important role in the teaching and learning process. In this study a novel learning environment based on MIT which takes students' interests and needs into an account has been developed. Many activities were carried out depending on students' intelligence types. The effects of different activities on students' achievements, attitudes toward chemistry and retention of knowledge in periodical features' variety at the 10th class were measured and compared. The comparison between experimental group, which was instructed through MIT learning strategies and materials, and control group thought by traditional methods was observed. The research was applied in the first semester of 2009-2010 education years. The study carried out on 75 high school students in Izmir. The application of the study was lasted for 8 weeks containing methods and tests' practices. Following MIT assessment survey, achievement test and attitude scales were used to analyze its effectiveness. Based on the theories and literature data, an instructional material included concept maps, puzzles, stories, classical music in background, group games, and photos about periodic features' variety as an alternative to traditional written material. As a result of statistical analysis there were significant differences between achievement post-test and attitudes post-test towards chemistry course of control and experimental groups. Consequently, instructional methods needed to be varied so students could use their intellectual strengths to better understand topics, increase their intrinsic motivation, intervention and encourage active student engagement to improve learning at middle school level. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This study aimed to determine how 33 urban 5th grade students' science conceptions changed during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds. Research on watershed and place-based education was used as a framework to guide the teaching of the unit as well as the research study. A teacher-researcher designed the curriculum, taught the unit and conducted the research using qualitative data sources such as concept maps, science notebooks and interviews. Most students came to understand that their watershed was part of an urban environment where water drains from the surrounding land into a body of water. Thus, they began to understand how urban land use affects water quality. This study provides evidence for the use of place-based learning in developing students' knowledge of the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) and watersheds. Implications of this study include the use of place-based learning in urban settings and the experiences needed for students to conceptualize watersheds. © 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Competencies are the cornerstone of effective public health practice, and practice specialties require competencies specific to their work. Although more than 30 specialty competency sets have been developed, a particular need remained to define competencies required of professionals who practice chronic disease prevention and control. To that end, the National Association of Chronic Disease Directors (NACDD) engaged a group of stakeholders in developing competencies for chronic disease practice. Methods: Concept mapping was blended with document analysis of existing competencies in public health to develop a unique framework. Public health experts reviewed the results, providing extensive and richer understanding of the issues. Results: The final product presents an integrated picture that highlights interrelationships among the specific skills and knowledge required for leading and managing state chronic disease programs. Those competencies fall into 7 clusters: 1) lead strategically, 2) manage people, 3) manage programs and resources, 4) design and evaluate programs, 5) use public health science, 6) influence policies and systems change, and 7) build support. Conclusion: The project yielded a framework with a categorization scheme and language that reflects how chronic disease practitioners view their work, including integrating communications and cultural competency skills into relevant job functions. Influencing policies and systems change has distinct relevance to chronic disease practice. We suggest uses of the competencies in the field.

AB  - Though the student concept maps reveal some knowledge gaps, students were able to incorporate a large number of nanorelated concepts into a logical arrangement. This indicates that, even with little or no previous relevant coursework and a rapid, short-course time frame, students were still able to assemble key concepts in a meaningful way. The final exam scores correlated well with the grades of individual concept maps, which may directly indicate the degree of student conceptual understanding for various topics. Of course, another explanation may be that the students who performed well on concept mapping assessments are high achievers, who also perform well on conventional examination-based assessments. To better assess the effectiveness of concept mapping with respect to enhancing student performance, we plan to continue these investigations with larger numbers of students in other regular-semester, threecredit courses, at both the first-year level and graduate levels. © 2010 Americal Chemical Society and Division of Chemical Education, Inc.

PY  - 2009

AB  - The current method of modeling the level of understanding students have of course content with a single letter grade is primitive at best. The simplification of weeks of learning into a single character representation does little to convey what a student ultimately knows. Two students ho receive the same grade in a course may, and often do, have a very different level of mastery of various course concepts. This paper presents a new paradigm for knowledge modeling and ssessment based on concept maps and concept inventories. Under this assessment method, student maps are generated to graphically depict a comprehensive model of student understanding of course concepts. This assessment paradigm begins by creating a comprehensive concept map that depicts each of the relevant concepts and relationships within the topic area being studied. Based upon a concept-inventory-driven analysis of student knowledge, a concept map representing the subset of the comprehensive map that students have mastered is generated as a representation of each student's knowledge. This paper presents an example of how such an assessment paradigm has been implemented in a mechatronics course unit in a large freshman engineering course. This course unit introduces students to many concepts from electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering. The unit includes an online lecture and a hands-on, lab-based activity in which students build a simple mobile robot. Over 1400 students participated in this course unit in Fall 2008. While the scope of this work is within a single course unit, this paper describes how such modeling can be done on a large scale to represent student knowledge gains in an entire course or even an entire degree program. The methods used for building the comprehensive concept map and an appropriate concept inventory are described. The software developed to generate student maps based on responses to a concept inventory is also discussed. Many applications of this paradigm are described including the use of such assessment methods to augment university admissions data, the ability o replace or augment transcripts and resumes with detailed student maps, the development of college rankings based on student learning outcomes, and objective faculty teaching evaluation based on student learning outcomes. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.

AB  - This study aimed to diagnose the cognitive structure of university science pupils regarding the topic energy relationships and energy flow in organisms. The study was carried out using a word association test on 150 students studying at the Selcuk University. A word association test comprising 10 key concepts 'sunlight energy, photosynthesis, respiration, producer, consumer, separator, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, glucose' was applied to the students, and concept maps were drawn according to the frequency table prepared from the answers given to the chosen key concepts. It is seen that the highest number of associations are, in descending order, sunlight-photosynthesis, producer-plants and discriminator-saprophyte. Although the students have responded to all the key concepts, it could be observed that they do not perceive the relationship between the concepts as a complete network. From this result, it is apparent that students experience very limited cognitive learning during their education. The proposal was developed on the importance of research results from the perspective of biology education, and the use of word association tests as an educational tool. © Sila Science.

AB  - An increasing number of educational institutions and organizations around the world employ online training to address emerging challenges in teacher competence. Research literature, however, showed that few studies have been conducted that followed teachers in their respective schools after training to evaluate their classroom performance. Enthused by this lack of empirical proof, this study was conducted to assess the modifications on pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) - an accepted construct in educational lexicon - of nine non-major science teachers who were given a month-long, fully online training. Using a multi-method assessment procedure (e.g., achievement testing, concept mapping, lesson planning, and demonstration teaching), results disclose substantial alteration in two knowledge-based PCK components in science teaching - knowledge about science curriculum and students' understanding of science. A significant increase in achievement scores, better concept map structure and corrected misconceptions were observed after the training. Contrastingly, only little improvement was noted in the other two skill-based components - knowledge about instructional strategies and assessment in science. Few changes were noticed in teachers' topic-specific strategies and science learning assessment skills. Based on these findings, it appeared that fully online teacher trainings were insufficient in enhancing all facets of the complex nature of science teaching. © 2010 De La Salle University, Philippines.

AB  - For students of health sciences, knowledge of biology is a cornerstone to successfully face the challenges presented to them related to this field of knowledge and to interpret specific phenomena of medical science and health. This paper shows the results of the use of the concept maps for meaningful learning of cellular biology concepts. Objective: to determine the effectiveness of the concept maps as a didactic strategy in the learning of concepts of cellular Biology in students of Health Sciences. Material and methods: It was worked with a cuasi-experimental design of pre-test and post-test with two intact groups: an experimental group (it used the concept maps as learning strategy) and a control group (it did not use the concept maps as learning strategy). The students were evaluated using a pre-test and post-test, built with multiple-choice questions with one answer in the levels of knowledge, comprehension and analysis of the cognitive domain of Bloom's Taxonomy. Results: In the post-test found no significant differences in the total number of questions. However significant differences were found between groups in the application level, observing better results in the experimental group. Conclusions: The concept maps gave students a tool to learn concepts of cell biology significantly. However, its effective use depends on factors such as motivation for learning, continuous training in mapping, significant contents of learning and implementation time.

AB  - The authors describe and discuss some recent applications of concept maps to physics teaching. They begin by reviewing the literature on applications of concept maps to science teaching, and argue for the usefulness of this resource in facilitating processes of conceptual change. They then describe two experiments on the collaborative use of concept maps to this end. The first was a study of how a team of teachers designed learning sequences using three-dimensional maps. In the second, concept maps were constructed and then collaboratively re-constructed by various groups of students. Finally, they discuss the preliminary results of these experiments on the processes of conceptual change, and suggest lines for further research. © 2010, IGI Global.

AB  - Simply placing electronic geoscience resources such as datasets, methods, ontologies, workflows and articles in a digital library or cyberinfrastructure does not mean that they will be used successfully by other researchers or educators. It is also necessary to provide the means to locate potentially useful content, and to understand it. Without suitable provision for these needs, many useful resources will go undiscovered, or else will be found but used inappropriately. In this article, we describe an approach to discovering, describing and understanding e-resources based on the notion that meaning is carried in the interconnections between resources and the actors in the cyberinfrastructure (including individuals, groups, organizations), as well as by ontologies and conventional metadata. Navigation around this universe is achieved by implementing the idea of perspectives as dynamic, conceptual views (defined by SPARQL-like queries against an OWL schema) that not only act as filters, but also dynamically promote and demote concepts, relationships and properties according to their immediate relevance. We describe a means to represent a wide variety of interactions between resources using the notion of a knowledge nexus, and we illustrate its use with resources and actors from the Geosciences Network (GEON) cyberinfrastructure community. We also closely link browsing and visualizing strategies to our nexus, drawing on ideas from semiotics to move resources and connections not currently of interest from the foreground to the background, and vice versa, using a new form of adaptive perspective. We illustrate our ideas via ConceptVista, an open-source concept mapping application that provides rich, visual depictions of the resources, cyber-community and myriad connections between them. Examples are presented that show how geoscientific knowledge can be explored not only via ontological structure, but also by use cases, social networks, citation graphs and organization charts; all of which may carry some aspects of meaning for the user. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Understanding of Earth's systems, including the crucial role of human beings within them, is an important part of citizens' ability to think intelligently and critically about the environment, pollution, sustainability and other socio-economic and scientific issues central to life in the modern world. Part of this understanding involves seeing the world as an integrated whole in which what happens in diverse places in the world may be equally relevant for students' lives. In this regard, it makes sense to study both remote and local environments within the system thinking approach-where such distinctions naturally become blurred. The present research, accordingly, focuses on a study unit entitled "Life at the Poles" and investigates the development of junior high school students' understanding of Earth systems and their level of conceptual complexity as a result of participating in it. The "Life at the Poles" unit is based on the "explanatory story" approach where one central theme is used as a focal point for an interdisciplinary study of certain natural phenomena, in this case, the possibility of life under the extreme conditions at the poles. Concept maps and Likert-type questionnaires were employed as research tools, allowing the collected data to be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. The research findings indicate that the students significantly improved their Earth systems understanding and, importantly, greatly increased their awareness of human beings' influence on the environment, including remote environments such as the pole. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - In this article, we describe an innovative capstone course for preservice K-8 teachers integrating action research and a unifying theme in science (AAAS in Science for all Americans. Oxford University Press, New York, 1989; NRC in National science education standards. National Academy Press, Washington, DC, 1996). The goals of the capstone course are to increase student knowledge of the unifying theme, improve written communication skills, and introduce students to educational research. We provide evidence that each of these goals is met. Student growth in theme knowledge is demonstrated through concept maps, questionnaires, and previously reported assessments. Improved writing ability is demonstrated using the spelling and grammar checking feature of Microsoft Word. The analysis of action research reports demonstrates that students are able to connect their action research project results to previous research. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.

AB  - Knowledge structures are often represented in the form of networks or maps of concepts. The coherence and connectivity of such knowledge representations is known to be closely related to knowledge production, acquisition and processing. In this study we use network theory in making the clustering and cohesion of concept maps measurable, and show how the distribution of these properties can be interpreted through the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. This approach allows to introduce new concepts of the "energy of cognitive load" and the "entropy of knowledge organization" to describe the organization of knowledge in the concept maps. © 2010.

AB  - Problem Statement: The effectiveness of science instruction, which aims to assure students’ complete and accurate understanding of science concepts, can only be effectively evaluated when it is measured using the appropriate measurement tools. Concept maps, multiple-choice tests, and interviews – all of which are employed in determining students’ understanding of science concepts – have been shown to be successful methods. However, each has its own limitations. In determining students’ understanding of concepts, the use of two-tier tests – which evaluate students’ understanding more effectively and which are easy to score and apply – is recommended. Purpose of Study: One of the topics of biology that students experience great difficulty in understanding is genetics. This study aims at developing a two-tier test which is able to effectively evaluate secondary education students’ understanding of the concepts of genetics, and conducting the validity and reliability analyses of the test. Methods: The two-tier test, which is aimed at determining secondary education students’ understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetics, was developed using a three-phase method. In the first phase, the test content was defined. In the second phase, the relevant literature was examined so as to determine students’ misunderstandings; students were interviewed, and they were given a multiple choice test with free-response answers in which they had to explain the reasons for their answers. In the third phase, 14 two-tier test items which were composed of multiple choice content questions in the first tier and a set of five justifications for every potentially selected response to the first tier were developed. The test was applied to 231 students, and then item analysis was performed. Test reliability was calculated using the Kuder-Richardson 20 formula. In order to determine construct validity, the method of group differences was employed. Findings and Results: The discrimination indices of items were found to be between 0.34 and 0.74. Item difficulties fell in the range of 0.25 to 0.67, and the test difficulty was found to be 0.43. Test reliability was calculated as 0.86. Conclusions: All the findings obtained from the item analysis, in addition to the findings from the validity and the reliability studies; demonstrate that the test may be utilized to determine secondary education students’ understanding of the concepts of genetics concepts in a valid and reliable way. Recommendations: Besides making a more effective evaluation possible, two-tier tests facilitate application and scoring. Therefore, we believe that developing and using such two-tier diagnostic tests in various fields will make significant contributions to science instruction. © 2009, Ani Publishing.

AB  - Students in a Landscape Architecture Design 1 course (N = 25) at a research university in the southern US developed design solutions implementing geologic time for an informal education site. Those students who employed abstract metaphors for their designs (n = 8) were more successful than students who proceeded with a linear design construct. Pre- and posttest assessments using the Petrified Wood Survey and student-constructed timelines suggested that 1) 75% geoscience content knowledge is needed for successful design, and 2) relative understanding of Earth events and the barrenness of early Earth's landscape is also prerequisite for successful design implementation. Most revealing of students' cognitive processes were the concept statements and concept maps produced during the project. The concept statement forced students to address the project's requirements, take a position with their concept development of abstract metaphorical representation, and proceed with a final design solution. It appears that concept statements with accompanying concept maps facilitate student cognition by forcing student comprehension and application of geoscience content knowledge. We suggest that an inclusion of concept statements when teaching application of a complex Earth system or process may facilitate students' geoscience cognition in design and/or informal educational settings.

AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate a collaborative concept-mapping technique that was integrated into coteaching in fourth-grade science classes in order to examine students' performance and attitudes toward the experimental teaching method. There are two fourth-grade science teachers and four classes with a total of 114 students involved in the study. This study used a mixed method design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings showed that the two teaching methods obtained significant difference with respect to students' test scores. Using collaborative concept mapping to learn science could increase the opportunity of discussion between peers, thus fostering better organization and understanding the content. In addition, coteaching could enable teachers to share their expertise with one another. It could facilitate the implementation of collaborative concept mapping and the construction of student's concept mapping. Team teachers' attitude could affect the students' learning performance. However, some of the students had negative views on drawing concept maps because they found it was troublesome to write down many words, difficult to draw and arrange proposition, and time-consuming. Coteachers' instant feedback and students' journal writing could guide and examine the students' concept maps to facilitate their cognitive learning. © School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - As chemical engineering education moves into the new millennium, the educators' role is to provide modern didactic methods in process design. Instructions in chemical engineering design need to reflect the challenges they face in industry. Similarly, to instigate the students way of thinking from the existing role of being a student to an engineer's thinking requires global constructs. How can chemical engineering curricula contribute to better communication skills? Knowledge maps are both important to all aspects of cognition and the most fundamental constructs in theories of the mind. This is because the construction and reconstruction of meanings by learners requires that they actively seek to integrate newly acquired knowledge with existing knowledge. It's not surprising that knowledge maps, particularly concept maps, offer many interesting learning opportunities that would uniquely equip students with a well-structured process for developing active knowledge and the ability to implement critical thinking. Mindful of the limited instructional aide available in chemical process design curriculum, this paper describes an approach to introducing students to knowledge maps in process design. The pedagogical basis for this approach is discussed. This work calls for pedagogic re-engineering in process design teaching and learning process by providing students with proficiencies in knowledge mapping tools to enhance communication between design stakeholders. The graphical communication, mapping, and process diagrams approach are described, and illustrated with examples i.e. concept map, PBFD, PFD, design logbook notes, as an operational framework for conveying complex technical information. The results obtained from using the mapping approach are described which demonstrate meaningful learning in written communication.

AB  - Science communication courses are becoming increasingly more popular in universities across the United States and several other countries-particularly tailored courses for specific disciplines (i.e. science communication for clinical sciences, professional writing for veterinarians, science and medical writing, communication skills for engineering students, writing in the health professions, etc.). This requires collaboration and integration of concepts and teaching methods between communication-and science-related disciplines to create these integrated, focused courses. This paper presents an examination of schema theory, mental modeling, concept mapping, and other information processing theories that have been used to teach communication, mathematics, and science information. The author explores how teachers from these different disciplines organize and present content-specific information to help facilitate learning and memory in students. Integrating teaching strategies from different disciplines may help for presenting science communication information. The paper also provides a few ideas on how science communication instructors might incorporate different teaching strategies from communication-, mathematics-, and science-related disciplines. © Common Ground, Raquel Harper, Donna Rouner, All Rights Reserved.

AB  - Widget is not a new computing concept, but it has recently attracted much research interest because of its potential uses in a range of technological products/services. In assuming the challenge to develop an evaluation scheme for widgets/widget-based applications, some conceptual ambiguities about widget, especially its distinction from portlet, need to be clarified first. A survey aiming to collect opinions in this regard was conducted. Qualitative data were analyzed with Cmap (a content map tool) and Nvivo8 (a content analysis tool). Widgets invite more diverse interpretations than portlets, for which specifications have existed for some time. Relationships between these two entities are not consistently understood by respondents. A consensual definition of widget entails more scientific discourses in the future and will have significant implications for developing a robust evaluation framework for widget-based platforms.

AB  - Nanotechnology has emerged in the engineering education of universities, and increased the students' difficulties in understanding and learning it. Concept mapping as a metacognitive tool may be appropriate for students to learn nanotechnology because previous research has confirmed that this tool helps students learn disciplines like chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. The current study used both quantitative and qualitative survey data to examine whether concept mapping as a metacognitive tool helps students learn nanotechnology, and to investigate the correlation between the students' perceptions of concept mapping and their metacognition abilities. The quantitative data consisted of 42 five-point Likert scale questions measuring students' perceptions of concept mapping and metacognition abilities with high reliability of the measurement. The qualitative data involved in-depth and semi-structured interviews to explore more detailed students' experience and perceptions in terms of how and why. The findings show that there is a significant positive relationship between students' positive evaluation of concept mapping and their metacognition. Students agreed that concept mapping was helpful in generating and clarifying the key concepts of nanotechnology, beneficial to guide the topic concept, and forming a more systematic knowledge structure through integrating prior knowledge and new knowledge. During the learning process of concept mapping, learners adopted a great quantity of metacognition behavior to examine and reflect the self-developed knowledge structure. The study concluded that concept mapping as a metacognitive tool was able to facilitate students to achieve high-level performance in the learning of nanometer knowledge. Future studies should further explore the interrelationships among concept mapping, metacognitive and knowledge transfer.

AB  - The present study conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts, accompanied by concept mapping instruction to eleventh-grade students' understanding of cellular respiration concepts, and their retention of this understanding. Cellular respiration concepts test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administrated as pre-test, post-test, and delayed post-test to a total of 70 eleventh-grade students in two classes of the same high school in an urban area, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group was a class of 34 students who received conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction. A class of 36 students comprised the control group who received traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous understanding and logical thinking ability were other independent variables involved in this study. The results showed that logical thinking, treatment, previous understanding of cellular respiration concepts each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students' understanding of cellular respiration concepts. The result also showed that conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction was significantly better than traditional instruction in retention of this understanding. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Knowledge management (KM) is the research field aimed to create, organize, and store explicit knowledge for easy access and manipulation, whereas e-learning is concerned with delivering a suite of knowledge contents to a group of learners via the Internet. Since e-learning techniques have grown quickly nowadays to complement the conventional learning system, integration of KM and elearning has been a tendency to improve the creation, organization, and delivery of a learner-oriented knowledge management system. Particularly, knowledge portal systems are usually efficient vehicles to realize this integration for we can create new content types on the portal sites to serve e-learning purpose. Nevertheless, a knowledge portal site allows the members to create and share their knowledge objects; implying that the website containing group knowledge grows itself unlimitedly and unexpectedly. To display the sitemap of a knowledge portal and observe the concept map of group knowledge, we have developed a visualization tool referred to as the Site-And-Concept (SAC) map generator. In this paper, we apply this map generator on a knowledge-portal-based e-learning system. Users can convert the generated concept maps into SCORM-compliant course packages with sequencing and navigation supports. They can further edit the learning content and share it to peer learners, and thus establish a collaborative learning environment. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This article presents a critical review and analysis of key studies that have been done in science education and other areas on the effects and effectiveness of using diagrams, graphs, photographs, illustrations, and concept maps as adjunct visual aids in the learning of scientific-technical content. It also summarizes and reviews those studies that have students draw diagrams, graphs, maps, and charts to express their understandings of the concepts and relationships that are present in the text they read or/and empirical data provided (i.e., student-generated adjunct visual productions). In general, the research and theory on instructional aids is fragmented and somewhat unsystematic with several flaws and a number of key uncontrolled variables, which actually suppress and mask effects in the studies that have been done. The findings of these studies are compared to relevant literature and empirical research and findings in the areas of cognitive psychology, computer science, neuroscience, and artificial intelligence that help to clarify many of the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of effects found for visual (e.g., diagrams and graphs) instructional aids in the science education literature currently and in the past 20 years. A model and a set of criteria and goals for improving research in this area is then described, as visuals are a first step in the process of learning formal (scientific) models, which are most often visually represented. Understanding how students learn formal models is one the outstanding research challenges in the next 20 years, both within and outside of science education. © Springer 2009.

AB  - The introduction of concept maps to primary teachers as tools to guide and scaffold their planning of learning activities in mathematics and science, or, alternatively as an assessment tool for student learning, was treated with some trepidation and reservations. That the tools have the potential to scaffold primary students' learning and understanding of mathematics and science concepts was an idea that needed empirical testing in primary classrooms. Over a period of five school terms, through professional development, on-going professional support and collaborations between teachers and university researchers, an incremental introduction of semi-structured concept maps was initiated in two primary classrooms. This classroom trial occurred over a period of time until a more receptive and conducive learning environment was established with primary students using concept maps to review their understanding of Position in the K-Year 1 classroom and Fish's Adaptive Features and Fractions in the Year 5/6 classroom. This chapter documents the professional journey of two primary teachers and their students as they struggled, persevered and succeeded in incorporating concept maps as learning and assessment tools, as part of their normal classroom practices during the year. The ultimate highlight of the innovative strategy was the initiative by the two primary teachers and their students to come together for peer tutoring and peer collaborations as the older students mentored and assisted the younger ones in using the software Inspiration TM to construct concept maps. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.

AB  - Secondary science methods courses provide preservice science teachers with the opportunity to learn content the way that science should be taught. A strategy for science teacher educators is to incorporate content that is unfamiliar to the students so that learning is authentic. In this chapter, we describe how to use regional environmental questions to model concept mapping for content learning and collaborative learning. We selected environmental questions that were familiar to students and relevant to their daily lives. We challenged our preservice teachers to apply their science content knowledge as we asked them to develop a concept map to include interdisciplinary science content to address our questions. This project promoted learning of the interdisciplinary nature of science, used concept mapping to develop a secondary science teacher education curriculum that promoted environmental education, and took advantage of concept mapping activities for collaborative learning while integrating discipline-specific content standards. Secondary teaching is a complex act that requires expertise in several different knowledge bases. Content knowledge, time, materials, and equipment management, learning and motivation theory, interpersonal relations, and educational policy and law are a few areas that great teachers know. Logically, one or two science content methods courses are inadequate to completely prepare science teachers to be effective for the real world of teaching. Science methods course instructors face the difficult task of selecting content and learning experiences that will provide the most value in producing master teachers. We are fortunate at our university to have two secondary science methods courses; the course described in this book chapter is not only focused primarily on lab-based science teaching but also includes safety, formative assessment, and field-based science teaching. It is also the only course in which students have significant exposure to educational technology. The primary goal for this course is to promote theory-and research-based science teaching practice. A continuous concern expressed in the literature about teacher education is the gap between recommended or research-based teaching methods and practice (e.g., Broekkamp and van Hout-Wolters 2007; Brouwer and Korthagen 2005; Zeichner and Tabachnick 1981). Science methods classes provide an ideal setting for addressing this gap. Science teacher educators have developed several strategies for trying to narrow this gap in science methods classes by producing teachers who will utilize highly effective teaching strategies rather than regressing to the unproven but familiar traditional pedagogy of transmitting information. These strategies include modeling effective practice (Hubbard and Abell 2005), demonstration lessons (Luft and Pizzini 1998), and including intensive field experiences (Penick and Yager 1988). In this chapter, we present another instructional approach of effective science teaching in the 21st century. We describe a project we have developed to make lessons learned in science methods courses more meaningful and more educative with regard to both how to teach (pedagogy) and what to teach (content). In this chapter, we present our rationale for initiating this project, the implementation with our secondary students, and some student outcomes and what we learned. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Acquisition of knowledge must be interwoven with the process of applying it. However, traditional training methods which provide abstract knowledge have shown ineffective for gaining experience of the work. In order to solve this problem, more and more researchers have included narrative in simulation, which is known as narrative simulation. By providing the narratives, participants recognize the choices, decisions, and experience that lead to the consequences of those decisions. It has been proven that narrative simulation is very useful in facilitating in-depth learning and reflective learning. However, conventional methods of data collection and narrative construction for narrative simulation are labor intensive and time consuming. They make use of previous narratives manually and directly. They are inadequate to cope with the fast moving world where knowledge is changing rapidly. In order to provide a way for facilitating the construction of narrative simulation, a novel computational narrative construction method is proposed. By incorporating technologies of knowledge-based system (KBS), computational linguistics, and artificial intelligence (AI), the proposed method provides an efficient and effective way for collecting narratives and automating the construction of narratives. The method converts the unstructured narratives into a structural representation for abstraction and facilitating computing processing. Moreover, it constructs the narratives that combine multiple narratives into a single narrative by applying a forecasting algorithm. The proposed method was successfully implemented in early intervention in mental health care of a social service company in Hong Kong since the case records in that process have structural similarities to narrative. The accuracies of data conversion and predictive function were measured based on recall and precision and encouraging results were obtained. High recall and precision are achieved in the data conversion function, and high recall for the predictive function when new concepts are excluded. The results show that it is possible for converting multiple narratives into a single narrative automatically. Based on the approach, it helps to stimulate knowledge workers to explore new problem solving methods so as to increase the quality of their solutions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The development of information technology brought a new prospect for the network study, the adaptive learning has been possible to meet learner's individual requirements. The case-based learning may provide the simulation situation for the learner, but the adaptive learning takes on the both superiority of the Case-based Learning and simulation situation. It takes the case as the study object, shields the relations between various concepts in the case, and simplified concept map. And also, it presents the learner's cognition abilities with belief vector, contacts learner's learning capability with the case. It can make students learn cases orderly with different levels, and it can make it possible of efficient study. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore students' learning satisfaction when applying concept mapping with computer assisted teaching tools and to reveal students' learning progress in Nanometer course. The research method adopted in depth interviews. A total of six participants from the Nanometer course at National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences in Taiwan participated in interviews lasting 30 to 60 minutes. The research results revealed that students satisfied with the concept mapping instruction in the Nanometer course. The concept mapping instruction did effectively improve students' comprehension and retention memories as well as inspire students' learning interests and enthusiasm for Nanometer technology. Additionally, students also agreed that concept mapping instruction is an applicable approach to be applied into other professional fields or self-applications besides the science-related subjects. Finally, results even further indicated the deficiencies and suggestions proposed from students for concept mapping instruction. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.

AB  - "Slowmation" (abbreviated from "Slow Motion Animation) is a new yet simple form of stopmotion animation which enables learners to create their own animations of science concepts. This paper presents a study of preservice elementary teachers in a science method classes (14 in one class in 2009) to ascertain if they improved their science knowledge when using a three phase framework requiring them to: (i) create their own Slowmation about a science concept; (ii) upload them to a web site (www.slowmation.com.au) so that they could be reviewed by a peer and a content expert; and (iii) if necessary, modify the animation and reupload it to be published on the Slowmation website. The two research questions were: (i) How did the three phase framework change the preservice teachers' science content knowledge and (ii) What was the value and motivation of the web site, for uploading and reviewing the animations? Qualitative data (three interviews, two concept maps and the animations as knowledge artifacts) collected from each preservice teacher showed that all of them increased their science content knowledge as a result of using the framework. Uploading the Slowmations to the website was successful for the students and enabled them to view other animations and created a social motivation to make and improve their animations. Getting preservice teachers to create Slowmations is a new way for them to engage with science content knowledge and is a new way for them to represent their science understandings. © Common Ground, David Macdonald, Garry Hoban.

AB  - This paper presents a study carried out at the University of the Basque Country UPV/EHU with the aim of evaluating the CM-ED (concept map editor) with social education students. Concept mapping is a widely accepted technique that promotes meaningful learning. Graphically representing concepts of the learning domain and relationships between them helps students integrate new knowledge into their current cognitive structure. Due to the flexibility of computer-aided drawing graphs, several concept mapping tools have been developed and their use has been studied over the last few years. CM-ED is a multilingual and multimedia software program designed for drawing concept maps. Until recently, CM-ED had been mainly used and evaluated in computer science university degree. This paper represents a qualitative step in the evaluation of CM-ED: from technical students to students of more theoretical fields. The main characteristics of the CM-ED editor and the carried out study are presented in this paper. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Chemical engineering majors learn to convert raw materials into products; as a result of this specificity, higher education in chemical engineering offers many opportunities and challenges to become more attuned with e-learning and incorporating learning tools. These challenges include providing modern didactic methods in process design courses. In addition instructions in process design courses need to reflect the challenges students may possibly face in industry. In order to instigate a new mode of students thinking in process design we basically need students to switch roles from the existing role of being a student to a practicing engineer's thinking that requires a global construct. Therefore the main focus may be directed on better communication skills in process design curriculums. This paper proposes the uses of knowledge maps in process design learning as an important aspect of cognition and fundamental constructs of theories in the mind. Given that the construction and reconstruction of meanings by learners requires that they actively seek to integrate newly acquired knowledge with existing knowledge. It's not surprising that knowledge maps particularly concept maps offer a visual aid to integrate knowledge that would uniquely equip students with a well-structured process for developing active knowledge and the ability to implement critical thinking. Mindful of the limited instructional aides available in chemical process design curriculum this paper describes an approach to introducing students to knowledge maps in process design. The pedagogical basis for this approach is discussed. This work calls for pedagogic re-engineering in process design teaching and learning process by providing students with proficiencies in knowledge mapping tools to enhance communication between design stakeholders to adopt needs based approach over one based on ever increasing consumption. The graphical communication, mapping, process diagrams approach are described, and illustrated with examples i.e. concept map, PBFD, PFD, design logbook notes as an operational framework for conveying complex technical information. The results obtained from using mapping approach are described which demonstrate meaningful learning in written communication.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of instructional materials for the subject of classification of matter as solids, liquids and gases that were developed using a holistic instructional design model on student achievement. In the study a pre-test/post-test with control group experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the 2004-2005 school year using a sample of 120 students in the 7 th grade (Experimental group 1=30, Experimental group 2=30, Control group 1=30, and Control group 2=30). At the beginning of the study a prior knowledge test, science attitude scale and Multiple Intelligence Fields Determination Scale were completed by the students. At the end of the study an achievement determination questionnaire was completed by the students in the experimental and control groups. Instructional material including student worksheets, student practice questions and a teacher guide were prepared by the researchers on the Freehand MXa program. In teaching the subject to the experimental groups, a holistic instructional approach was used that combined reliance on multiple intelligence theory, a constructivist approach, deliberate use of analogies and an emphasis on science process skills. In addition, concept maps and an animation were used. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Cohen's size effect, and the Scheffe Test with the SPSS 11.00 program at the.05 significance level. At the beginning of the study, it was found that while there was no statistically significant difference between the students of the experimental and control groups, at the end of the study levels of achievement of the students on this subject in the two experimental groups were higher than both control groups. © The Turkish Online Journal of Educational Technology 2002.

AB  - Information communication technology has not only changed the way of presenting learning material and learning methods, but also the interaction between teachers and student as well as student themselves. This project of inquiry learning employs a digital storyboard as a scaffolding strategy to facilitate reasoning ability by constructing a cognitive map. This project is composed of the two phases: 1) uncover problem-solving strategies (e.g. realistic or autistic thinking) by analyzing their learning maps when playing in a case named the Wright Brothers; and 2) investigate the effects of situated problem-solving knowledge used by the students for further inferences. It is an ongoing study focusing on qualitatively understanding the effectiveness of scaffolding strategies in a digital interactive context. The students' problem-solving strategies will be analyzed in the concept maps. In addition, the video clips and field notes as well as the e-portfolios will be collected from the Web learning and Blended teaching.

AB  - The University of Cincinnati (UC) College of Engineering offers a college-wide Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program to address the need for more qualified faculty in engineering programs and to improve the overall educational environment. The UC PFF program consists of three one-hour courses and a mentored teaching component. The first course, in the Winter Quarter, provides information on basic effective teaching techniques for engineering, including Kolb learning styles, and how to organize a course. In addition, cultural differences and diversity are discussed in the context of science and engineering classes. The advanced teaching class in Spring Quarter emphasizes advanced pedagogical techniques including Bloom's taxonomy, concept maps, project and team management for developing leadership skills, teaching evaluations, proposal writing, and mentoring and being mentored. ABET engineering criteria a-k are applied to syllabus development, and students hold a mock NSF review panel based on a proposed project in engineering education. The final course, in Autumn Quarter, explores the academic job search process and the range of academic careers available. Panel discussions with new faculty, hiring committees from teaching-oriented and research-oriented universities, and recently tenured faculty provide up-to-date information. This paper focuses on the experience of a PFF student participant during the 2006-2007 academic year, as well as the experiences of and benefits to his PFF program coordinator and academic research mentor. Overall, participating in the program helped the student to prepare for an academic career. Having two faculty mentors in the PFF program activities provided invaluable opportunities and feedback. The mentored teaching activities applied the concepts learned in the PFF courses. The individualized mentored teaching experience included teaching undergraduate and graduate courses, giving talks at research seminars, and mentoring senior projects and REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC. Various methods of active learning, motivating students, problem-based active laboratory learning, and peer tutoring were explored and applied to mentor students. The paper also includes feedback from the PFF program coordinator and the academic research mentor. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.

TI  - Utilizing software-generated concept maps based on customized concept inventories to illustrate student learning and knowledge gaps

AB  - Concept inventories have been developed for a variety of disciplines over the last 20 years in order to evaluate student understanding of subjects within the discipline at the conceptual level. Concept inventories have served as a basis for evaluation of student's fundamental understanding of topics and students' responses to concept inventories showcase areas where there is need for enrichment. Concept maps are directed graphs that depict the relationships within a discipline and have been used since the 1970s to showcase how knowledge is constructively assembled within a learner's cognitive structure. Concept maps graphically depict the concepts and relationships within a discipline. Typically, concept maps are constructed by students in order to allow evaluators to understanding learners' comprehension of the relationships that exist within a discipline. In this paper software is described that has been developed to couple concept inventories with concept maps in order to elicit graphical representations of students' understanding of a discipline based upon their responses to a custom-designed concept inventory. This software allows for entry of the questions and answers within a concept inventory and allows each answer to be correlated with a concept or relationship in a concept map. Under this system an expert develops a comprehensive concept map that depicts all of the underlying concepts and relationships within a discipline and then the questions in the concept inventory are tied to the appropriate portions of the concept map. The results of the deployment of the inventory are then depicted in a graphical student map showcasing each individual learner's mastery of the underlying concepts and relationships as a concept map that is a subset of the comprehensive map. The software also generates aggregate maps based upon various demographics so that performance can be examined on both a student-by-student basis and also at a holistic higher level. This software has been used in conjunction with a course unit on mechatronics designed to introduce first-semester engineering students to the fundamentals of mechanics and electronics. A comprehensive map has been developed and a corresponding concept inventory has been designed to test student's knowledge gains through participation in the course unit. The concept inventory has been given as a pre and post test and has also been given in a subsequent semester to evaluate student retention of conceptual knowledge over time. Over 1400 data sets have been collected and analyzed. Within this paper the components of the analysis software are discussed along with some results from data analysis. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.

AB  - This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study conducted on a service course offered to non-electrical engineering majors at a large Midwestern university. The study focused on understanding the reasons why students perform relatively low in service courses. The mixed method approach was used to measure the performance in two different ways and then triangulate the results for a deeper understanding of the issue. For the quantitative phase, a closed form questionnaire was developed for the entire class that measured student attitude and their understanding of core concepts related to a specific topic. For the qualitative phase, a concept map was developed for the specific topic for one-on-one interview sessions with a representative sample. The data was collected with the two instruments for five consecutive semesters (n 1=253, and n2=44). Our analyses of the data have identified some inherent flaws in the teaching methodology for service courses that contribute towards rote learning. These courses need to be made more relevant and conceptually grounded along with a refocusing of the course content. Moreover, the two instruments developed in this study may form the basis for a broader framework for the formative evaluation of engineering courses. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2010.

AB  - The research reported here consists of the introduction of an intervention based on a series of laboratory activities combined with concept mapping. The purpose of this intervention was to enhance student understanding of acid-base chemistry for tenth grade students' from two classes in a Turkish high school. An additional aim was to enhance student attitude toward chemistry. In the research design, two cohorts of students were compared; those from the intervention group (N∈=∈31) and a second group (N∈=∈28) who were taught in a more traditional manner. Student understanding of acid-base chemistry was evaluated with a pretest/posttest research design using a purpose-designed instrument, the Concept Achievement Test (CAT) consisting of 25 items, 15 multiple choice and ten multiple choice with explanation. Alternative conceptions identified in the pretest were incorporated into the intervention, which thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with scientific views for the concepts. Statistical tests indicate the instrument is reliable (with an alpha reliability of 0.81) and the analysis of the findings revealed statistically significant differences between the intervention and traditional groups with respect to conceptual understanding. Examination of student explanations and analyses of semi-structured interviews conducted with selected students suggest that the main influence was the laboratory activities. Analysis of the findings in the context of relevant literature that concept mapping in conjunction with laboratory activities is more enjoyable, helps student link concepts, and reduces their alternative conceptions. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2007.

AB  - This study conducted by based on student drawings and interviews was held with the aim of determining misconceptions of science students receiving education in universities about the water cycle. There are a number of techniques to indicate misconceptions of students. Open ended questions, two-stage diagnosis tests, concept maps, word association and interviews are some of these techniques. In addition, science educators have started to use drawings methods in order to ensure students to understand science and to obtain knowledge about their misconceptions recently. As a result of analysis of drawings and interviews, it was seen that more than half of students has comprehensive or partially conceptual knowledge, but approximately one fourth of students has misconceptions about this subject. In addition, it was determined that students have misconceptions like water cycle is only evaporation of water from the earth to the atmosphere and its return to the earth from the atmosphere by condensing. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners' concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - The study reported here encouraged students to learn about water resource by using a case scenario on local water problems. After each group of students studied the case, students were asked to search for more information on local water resources, water quality, and comparative quality of water. A local sage was invited to give a talk to the students who later used the knowledge gained to discuss the way to solve the case problems. Students reported their ideas to friends as well as constructed their own webblog to present what they had learned. Students' presentation, report, webblog, concept map, pre-post test, and observation were used to assess their achievements from this lesson. The average score was 75.38 from 100 points indicating that most students achieved the objectives of the lesson. They could build knowledge from the case, search for information on their own, and discuss with friends as well as present the understanding via the webblog. Some problems still need to be solved such as allowing for more time and providing computer each for the student who did not own one. © Common Ground, Jongdee To-im, Chakpet Tianchai, Nantawadee Tianchai, Watcharee Ketpichainarong, Piyachat Jittam, Namkang Sriwattanarothai, Pintip Ruenwongsa.

AB  - Nanotechnology, novel and multidisciplinary knowledge has emerged in the engineering education of universities and has increased the students' difficulties in understanding and learning it. Concept mapping as a metacognitive tool may be appropriate for students to learn nanotechnology because previous research has confirmed that this tool helps students learn disciplines like chemistry, physics, biology and materials science. The current study used both quantitative and qualitative survey data to examine whether concept mapping as a metacognitive tool helps students learn nanotechnology, and to investigate the correlation between the students' perceptions of concept mapping and their metacognition ability. The quantitative data consisted of 42 five-point Likert scale questions measuring students' perceptions of concept mapping and metacognition abilities with high reliability of the measurement. The qualitative data involved in-depth and semi-structured interviews to explore more detailed students' experiences and perceptions in terms of how and why. The findings show that there is a significant positive relationship between students' positive evaluation of concept mapping and their metacognition. Students agreed that concept mapping was helpful in generating and clarifying the key concepts of nanotechnology, beneficial to guide the topic concept, and forming a more systematic knowledge structure through integrating prior knowledge and new knowledge. During the learning process of concept mapping, learners adopted a great quantity of metacognition behavior to examine and reflect the self-developed knowledge structure. The study concluded that concept mapping as a metacognitive tool was able to facilitate students to achieve high-level performance in the learning of nanometer knowledge. Future studies should further explore the interrelationships among concept mapping, metacognitive and knowledge transfer.

AB  - Science assessment in secondary schools requires instruments and techniques that reveal the depth and complexity of students' science understandings and capabilities. Because students' knowledge, reasoning, and skills vary across science domains and contexts, assessments must encompass a range of tasks, formats, and techniques. This article focuses on six types of assessment: question–demonstration assessments, performance assessments, information technologies, conceptual inventories and item clusters, concept maps, and student notebooks. For each of these, distinctive features are outlined; example items are provided; and formative and summative uses are described where applicable. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The system of natural language enables members of human species to externalize and exchange thoughts within the social group, and through the intervention of writing system. The human language system has generative power which, according to the Cognitive Architectural Model, rests on its tripartite architecture. In this architecture, there lies language-relevant information in, at least, three specific distinct representational formats: the meaning; the syntax; and the sound structures of words and utterances. In this paper, the Levelt and Reolofs Cognitive Architectural model is examined, and attempts are made to apply it to the learning and teaching of English for Science and Technology (EST). It is discovered that the cognitive machinery of language embodies both production and comprehension which instantiates a continuous internal dialogue between the instructor and the learner. It equally recognises that the Model significantly factors in and showcases a feedforward process and a spreading-activation of principles of lemma retrieval in speaking which are well-established in Stimulus-Response Approach thus giving room for Feedback. This paper, however, criticises the theory of isolating speaking single words as emphasized by the model without references to explicit explanations and integration of other language skills such as listening, reading and writing, and predicts that such practice is bound to fail in pedagogical situations. The paper recommends, among others, that the Model should incorporate continued discourse in order to meet the English language requirements of learners of science and technology. To successfully apply the Model, the paper also recommends the use of inquiry teaching and learning approach and concept-mapping strategy simultaneously. © Common Ground, Sunday Adejimola Amuseghan.

AB  - The fundamental presence of mathematics in the development and comprehension of physics and its applications in physics learning has many forms. Beyond being an indispensable component in the definition of metric concepts that express physical magnitudes, it allows the construction of mathematical models to represent multiple physical phenomena. Mathematical models have several applications in physics. First year physics students often ignore the important role mathematics and particularly mathematical models play in the learning of physics. Students limit themselves to the use of a menu of equations often misunderstood as a set of cook-book procedures applied to solve physics problems, without a real understanding of the reason for using a particular function or model to solve a problem. This chapter reflects on the outcome of a research project undertaken at Universidad Nacional del Táchira (UNET), Venezuela, which focuses on the different ways teachers and students could use concept mapping and Gowin's Vee for the mathematical modelling of physical phenomena. We have designed a strategy for the teaching and learning of mathematical models most used in first year physics courses. This strategy uses concept maps to improve understanding of basic conceptual structures involved in the mathematical modelling process of physical phenomena, and Gowin's Vee as a tool that facilitates the process of building a student's own knowledge of a mathematical model for a particular experiment. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.

AB  - This paper explores the occurrence of conceptual incoherence in upper secondary school textbooks resulting from the use of multiple historical models. Swedish biology and chemistry textbooks, as well as a selection of books from English speaking countries, were examined. The purpose of the study was to identify which models are used to represent the phenomenon of gene function in textbooks and to investigate how these models relate to historical scientific models and subject matter contexts. Models constructed for specific use in textbooks were identified using concept mapping. The data were further analyzed by content analysis. The study shows that several different historical models are used in parallel in textbooks to describe gene function. Certain historical models were used more often then others and the most recent scientific views were rarely referred to in the textbooks. Hybrid models were used frequently, i. e. most of the models in the textbooks consisted of a number of components of several historical models. Since the various historical models were developed as part of different scientific frameworks, hybrid models exhibit conceptual incoherence, which may be a source of confusion for students. Furthermore, the use of different historical models was linked to particular subject contexts in the textbooks studied. The results from Swedish and international textbooks were similar, indicating the general applicability of our conclusions. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Concept mapping is a meta-learning strategy based on the Ausubel-Novak-Gowin theory of meaningful learning. In a concept map, concepts are related with linking words to form propositions. By expanding this concept-proposition link, one eventually forms a web of concepts whose meanings are embedded in the presented map. The paper describes the author's experience with students' use of concept maps and how concept maps are scored. The strategy was utilized as an advance organizer and as an assessment tool (for diagnostic and summative purposes). Sample concept maps constructed by students taking up Introductory Physics are presented.

AB  - The rationale for this chapter is closely linked to the context of foreign language learning in English secondary schools, a context in which motivation to learn languages is recognised as being in need of development (Nuffield Languages Inquiry 2000; King 2003). Research shows that languages are increasingly becoming an elite subject, with fewer children from poorer families choosing to continue to learn them (Centre for Information on Language Teaching and Research, Association for Language Learning and University Council of Modern Languages 2003). Problems of motivation can lead to disappointing standards of achievement or, at worst, disruptive behaviour in the classroom, truancy and exclusion from school (Social Exclusion Unit 1998; Department for Education and Skills 2003, 2004). Faced with such problems, many teachers believe it is important to 'tighten up' classroom discipline in an attempt to control the pupils' behaviour. In this chapter, I will suggest, however, that teachers' attempts to increase control may be counterproductive and themselves lead to higher levels of disaffection. Drawing on research into learners' constructions of language learning, I explore why there is an urgent need for teachers to consider the links between learner autonomy and motivation theory in order to find ways of transferring control to the learners. I take the position that locating the problem of poor motivation in learners themselves is socially unjust. Blaming the learners or their families for underachievement or lack of motivation is problematic especially given the differential levels of achievement and engagement between children of different socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds (Gillborn & Mirza 2000; Department for Education and Skills 2002). Rejection of such deficit theories leads to a more critical perspective, in which the education system itself (curriculum, structures, etc.) is construed as the problem, clearly failing particular sections of the population. Drawing on urban education theory and research from a critical theory perspective, I have previously reconceptualised disaffection as a search for a voice in a context of disenfranchisement (Lamb 2000). Here I develop this reconceptualisation further by reporting on a broader ethnographic research project designed to privilege young learners' voices, and position them as experts in their own learning. These expert voices belong to children aged 14 to 15 (i.e. in Year 9 of compulsory education), learning French or German in a secondary school in a northern English city, where several years earlier a number of language teachers had introduced flexible learning, a system of classroom organisation which involved learners in making choices of learning activities from a bank of resources according to their own individual needs (Lamb 2003). I accessed the voices of these teenagers by means of focused group conversations (FGCs) (Lamb 2005), specifically designed as a tool which would offer young learners an inclusive and supportive framework for constructing and articulating difficult constructs. Four groups of six learners were involved in the research, with the groups organised according to levels of achievement and motivation (A1: low achievers, motivated; A2: low achievers, less motivated; B1: high achievers, motivated; B2: high achievers, less motivated). I transcribed the focus group conversations as accurately as possible in the local dialect, though for the purpose of comprehensibility by an international audience I am reporting them here in a slightly amended form. My main intention in this research was not to make generalised statements about the ways in which motivated and unmotivated learners construe learning (though interestingly there were broad differences between the groups in many of the conversations). Rather, I wanted to offer an environment in which young learners could feel comfortable about expressing their thoughts about language learning, suspending as far as possible the usual power relationships between adult and children. This was achieved by means of carefully devised FGC protocols influenced by a range of questioning techniques (Holstein and Gubrium's [1995] 'active interviewing', Tomlinson's [1989] 'hierarchical focusing', and Roy's [1991] work on cognitive interviewing); varied activities such as 'concept mapping' (Powney & Watts 1987: 30), projective techniques (LeCompte & Preissle 1993: 164), drawing and self-rating scales; as well as critical consideration of my persona and role in the group, and attention to environment and atmosphere (Lamb 2005: 184-212). In the rest of this chapter, I will focus on issues of control which emerged in the focus group conversations and which are specifically related to motivational beliefs. Here I will make particular connections to general motivation theory rather than to the social-psychological approaches of Gardner and Lambert (e.g. 1972) which are specific to language learning. In doing so, I am building on the paradigm shift in motivation research in language learning triggered by Crookes and Schmidt's (1991) encouragement to re-examine the direction which had been taken by research in this field. An important feature of this shift is that it encouraged a greater focus on the practical implications of motivation research for the classroom (Dörnyei 1994, 1996; Oxford & Shearin 1994, 1996; Williams & Burden 1997). It also ushered in aspects of general motivation theory which relate to autonomy, such as in the work of Dickinson (1995), Ushioda (1994, 1996) and Dörnyei (1998). Of course, motivation is contextualised (Dörnyei 1994, 2001b; Vallerand 1997), and learner autonomy is similarly 'situated' (Murphey 2003), which means that my arguments in this chapter need to be understood within the specific context in which the research was carried out. Nevertheless, I hope that it is possible to reflect on the implications for any context, be it teaching English or other languages to children or adults. © 2009 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

AB  - This research is concerned with preservice teacher understanding of six earth and space science concepts that are often taught in elementary school: the reason for seasons, phases of the moon, why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two sections of a science methods course (N= 52) completed an open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest) demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. Concept mapping had an additive effect in building understanding, as evident on the second posttest. The findings suggest useful strategies for university science instructors to use in clarifying science concepts while modeling activities teachers can use in their own classrooms. 2009 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - The power of computer game technology is currently being harnessed to produce "serious games". These "games" are targeted at the education and training marketplace, and employ various key game-engine components such as the graphics and physics engines to produce realistic "digital-world" simulations of the real "physical world". Many approaches are driven by the technology and often lack a consideration of a firm pedagogical underpinning. The authors believe that an analysis and deployment of both the technological and pedagogical dimensions should occur together, with the pedagogical dimension providing the lead. This chapter explores the relationship between these two dimensions, and explores how "pedagogy may inform the use of technology", how various learning theories may be mapped onto the use of the affordances of computer game engines. Autonomous and collaborative learning approaches are discussed. The design of a serious game is broken down into spatial and temporal elements. The spatial dimension is related to the theories of knowledge structures, especially "concept maps". The temporal dimension is related to "experiential learning", especially the approach of Kolb. The multi-player aspect of serious games is related to theories of "collaborative learning" which is broken down into a discussion of "discourse" versus "dialogue". Several general guiding principles are explored, such as the use of "metaphor" (including metaphors of space, embodiment, systems thinking, the internet and emergence). The topological design of a serious game is also highlighted. The discussion of pedagogy is related to various serious games we have recently produced and researched, and is presented in the hope of informing the "serious game community". © 2009, IGI Global.

AB  - Concept maps are an effective way of representing a person's understanding of a domain of knowledge. The traditional way of constructing concept maps uses paper and pencil. The concept maps, that time, were not easy to construct incrementally, and there was no such tools to help students to scaffold the concept maps. Although there are lots of tools to help students constructing concept maps recently, students still learning from paper textbook most of time. Additionally they have to context switch between paper and computer to search for the concepts to link and the description for the relationships of two concepts. Therefore, we propose a mechanism, Concept Base Study Guide system, by pen gesture for organizing the computer and the paper textbook to develop concept maps, and scaffold student constructing concept maps easily and incrementally.

AB  - Over the last 25 years the Department of Chemical Engineering at Curtin University of Technology has delivered a very traditional curriculum providing graduates with a strong practical orientation. Recent feedback from industry has, however, emphasised the need for graduates to have improved problem solving skills, interpersonal group skills and critical thinking. Problem Based Learning (PBL) is a learning environment in which the problem drives the learning. It has proved to be an effective and an enjoyable experience. However, most of the PBL courses were developed in the area of health sciences with very few engineering departments fully implementing the approach. Is PBL actually more difficult to implement into an engineering course? What issues do we have to consider in developing a suitable unit structure for PBL? This paper presents challenges being faced to implement PBL techniques in Risk Management, one of the chemical engineering degree's 4th year units, in order to create a learning environment that involves active and cooperative learning, prompt feedback, critical thinking, student accountability and a fun experience. The paper will discuss aspects of our executable plan of action for PBL implementation for this unit.

AB  - Acquisition of conceptual knowledge is a central aim in science education. In this study we monitored an interdisciplinary hypermedia assisted learning unit on hibernation and thermodynamics based on cooperative learning. We used concept mapping for the assessment, applying a pre-test/post-test design. In our study, 106 9th graders cooperated by working in pairs (n = 53) for six lessons. As an interdisciplinary learning activity in such complex knowledge domains has to combine many different aspects, we focused on long-term knowledge. Learners working cooperatively in dyads constructed computer-supported concept maps which were analysed by specific software. The data analysis encompassed structural aspects of the knowledge corresponding to a target reference map. After the learning unit, the results showed the acquisition of higher-order domain-specific knowledge structures which indicates successful interdisciplinary learning through the hypermedia learning environment. The benefit of using a computer-assisted concept mapping assessment for research in science education, and in science classrooms is considered. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The synergic effects of knowledge accumulation, information technology development, and globalization have produced a new set of social paradigms. The transition towards a post-industrial society became evident at the beginning of the 21st century. New challenges are presented to the educational system, and a revision of methodological procedures is imperative to prepare citizens capable of dealing with complex contemporary issues. This chapter proposes 'expanded collaborative learning' for didactic activities involving peer review of any material produced by groups of students. We present a particular experience in which higher education students produced peer reviewed collaborative concept maps during an introductory course about natural sciences. Besides posing an unusual task for students, peer review changes the evaluation paradigm in traditional classrooms, reduces the power asymmetry between teacher and students, and promotes a truly collaborative atmosphere. This learning environment presents favorable conditions for empowering students, fostering them to act as autonomous citizens capable of transforming society. © 2010, IGI Global.

AB  - Personal and Professional Development (PPD) is now key to the undergraduate medical curriculum and requires provision of appropriate learning experiences. In order to achieve this, it is essential that we ascertain students' perceptions of what is important in their PPD. We required a methodological approach suitable for a large medical school, which defines constructs used by the students to describe their PPD, and is not constrained by a researcher's predetermined line of questioning. It should also quantify the saliencies of these constructs in the student population and indicate how they gauge their own PPD. The instrument should also be suitable for administration at key stages of the students' learning experience. Here we describe the first stages in developing a novel method, which fulfils these requirements. It is based on a modified self repertory grid, the "Ideal Self" Inventory. All first year students (N = 379), provided five descriptors of a "good medical student" and of a not very good medical student, which generated 1,531 'ideal' qualities. To define underlying themed constructs, 49 randomly selected descriptors, were grouped together by self selected students (n = 55), using commonly held assumptions. Frequency of item co-occurrence was tabulated by multidimensional scaling. Themed clusters of 'ideal' qualities, defined by hierarchical cluster analysis, were overlaid onto the multidimensional scaling to generate a concept map. This revealed seven themed constructs; Personal Welfare, Time and Self Management Committed Work Ethic, Learning Skills, Personal Development/Reflection, Personal and Professional Conduct and Teamwork. We then analysed the 1,531 'ideal' qualities, by determining the frequency with which students used each construct and the proportion of students who used a construct at least once. Personal and Professional Conduct, Committed Work Ethic and Time and Self Management were the most frequently used, implying that they were the most salient for the first year students. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - In this work mind maps and concept maps will be used to facilitate the process of learning by quantifying the ability of students to connect existing memories to new concepts. Research from cognitive and neural science indicates that learning occurs through the repeated process of storing, retrieving, and connecting information. Aligning instruction with the way in which students learn is difficult. Instruction is often delivered using a topic-by-topic presentation of material because the instructor's expertise in a field, coupled with repeated application of concepts, facilitates this approach. Instructors are able to quickly and easily retrieve information because they have a vast network of neural paths developed through repeated use. Students, on the other hand, are faced with both establishing the connection of stored information to new concepts and strengthening the connection with repeated use. If the connection between retrieved information and the new concept is made, learning will occur - otherwise it will not. This research explores the use of mind maps and concept maps as quantitative tools to measure the learning process of students and to identify important missing connections between concepts. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2009.

AB  - The paper is devoted to the knowledge assessment system that has been developed at the Department of Systems Theory and Design of Riga Technical University for the last four years. The system is based on concept maps that allow displaying the knowledge structure of a particular learner in the form of a graph. Teacher's created concept maps serve as a standard against which learner's concept maps are compared. However, it is not correct to compare teacher's and learners' concept maps by examining the exact equivalence of relationships in both maps, because people construct knowledge in different ways. Thus, an appropriate mechanism is needed for the flexible evaluation of learners' concept maps. The paper describes the algorithm implemented in the concept map based knowledge assessment system and its evolution through four prototypes of the system. Copyright © 2006-2009 by CCC Publications.

AB  - The alertness of individuals with profound intellectual and multiple disabilities is a recurring issue for both researchers and direct support persons. A literature review reveals that alertness is an ambiguous concept, and information about environmental conditions that may have an impact on alertness is lacking. However, joint agreement about the concept is important for researchers and DSPs. To generate an expert discussion we employed the method of Concept Mapping. Two Concept Maps were developed based on the following two questions: How can we describe alertness for individuals in the target group? What are the environmental conditions that can have an impact on alertness? The first map shows that descriptions should include a behavioral and an internal aspect of alertness. According to the second map, environmental conditions can be classified into four clusters: 1) interaction, 2) stimulation and activities, 3) communication, and 4) a cluster that emphasizes the importance of taking individual differences into account. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - Software engineering is a comprehensive and highly practical course, traditional teaching is very inadequate. Concept maps are a way to develop logical thinking and study skills, by revealing connections and helping students see how individual ideas form a larger whole. According to its characters concept maps should be used to improve software engineering teaching. In recent years both research and application of concept man have made great progress. Concept maps become increasingly mature method. In this paper we introduce the challenge which software engineering teaching is facing with. Then we proposed that concept maps can be employed to the software engineering teaching. The role and the application approach of concept map are explored. The practices show that concept maps are excellent teaching, learning and evaluating tools in software engineering. The results are remarkable. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - This study used scientometric methods to conduct an automatic content analysis on the development trends of science education research from the published articles in the four journals of International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Research in Science Education, and Science Education from 1990 to 2007. The multi-stage clustering technique was employed to investigate with what topics, to what development trends, and from whose contribution that the journal publications constructed as a science education research field. This study found that the research topic of Conceptual Change & Concept Mapping was the most studied topic, although the number of publications has slightly declined in the 2000's. The studies in the themes of Professional Development, Nature of Science and Socio-Scientific Issues, and Conceptual Chang and Analogy were found to be gaining attention over the years. This study also found that, embedded in the most cited references, the supporting disciplines and theories of science education research are constructivist learning, cognitive psychology, pedagogy, and philosophy of science. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - This study (1) explores the effectiveness of the contextualized history of science on student learning of nature of science (NOS) and genetics content knowledge (GCK), especially interrelationships among various genetics concepts, in high school biology classrooms; (2) provides an exemplar for teachers on how to utilize history of science in genetics instruction; and (3) suggests a modified concept mapping assessment tool for both NOS and GCK. A quasi-experimental control group research design was utilized with pretests, posttests, and delayed posttests, combining qualitative data and quantitative data. The experimental group was taught with historical curricular lessons, while the control group was taught with non-historical curricular lessons. The results indicated that students in the experimental group developed better understanding in targeted aspects of NOS immediately after the intervention and retained their learning 2 months after the intervention. Both groups developed similar genetics knowledge in the posttest, and revealed a slight decay in their understanding in the delayed posttest. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2009.

AB  - The teaching of Computer Aided Design (CAD) constitutes a major challenge today. Designers from various academic disciplines (architects, engineers, graphics designers, etc.) who are more or less familiar with CAD technology seek more creative ways of expression. Since these technologies are in the midst of a rather rapid evolution, tailoring instruction to meet these potential challenges calls for an ongoing modernization as well as a constant adaptation of our teaching methods in order to satisfy the fluctuating needs, not only of the business world, but also of the contemporary teaching practices of adult education. In this paper, an attempt is made to provide an overview of various teaching practices geared toward the creation of a sound learning environment within the CAD laboratory while managing existing concept maps. The goal here is to help reinforce students' metacognitive abilities since they have been proven paramount in their learning journey. One of the most promising teaching practices illustrated herein is the use of videotutorials as well as the use of video-recordings from student's screens in the monitoring and improvement of metacognition in individual students. © 2009 CAD Solutions, LLC.

AB  - This study explored the effectiveness of an inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit in promoting inquiry in undergraduate students in biotechnology. The following tools were used to assess the students' achievements and attitude: conceptual understanding test, concept mapping, students' documents, CLES questionnaire, students' self reflection, and interviews. Judging from their conceptual understanding test results and concept mapping, students gained significantly more content knowledge on enzyme-substrate interaction and its application. In addition, students' reports on their projects revealed that they have developed their critical thinking, scientific process skills and abilities to apply knowledge on enzyme cellulase to industrial application. The students reacted positively to this teaching strategy as demonstrated by results from questionnaire responses, students' self reflection and interviews. The success of this inquiry-based laboratory unit might be due to both the context which was of interest to students, and the instruction method which ranged from a guided to a more open inquiry. Most importantly, the teacher in this study had mastery of both content and pedagogical techniques. This inquiry-based cellulase laboratory unit provided significant benefits for teaching and learning science for biotechnology students. It promoted acquisition of content knowledge and skills such as asking good questions, predicting, problem solving, drawing conclusion, and communication. This inquiry-based laboratory unit may serve as a guideline or framework for implementing a dynamic instruction with a range of inquiry level for the undergraduates. © 2010 IJESE.

AB  - We have developed computer environments that support learning by teaching, concept mapping, scaffolding, and the use of self regulated learning (SRL) skills by social interactions with virtual agents. More specifically, students teach a computer agent, Betty, and can monitor her progress by asking her questions and getting her to take quizzes. The system provides SRL support via dialog-embedded prompts. Our primary goals have been to support learning in complex science domains and facilitate development of self-regulated learning skills. Our analyses have identified actions such as "asking queries" and "tracing explanations" as key self-regulation strategies that promote learning.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of metaconceptual teaching interventions on students' understanding of force and motion concepts. A multimethod research design including quasi-experimental design and case study designs was employed to compare the effect of the metaconceptual activities and traditional instruction and investigate students' reactions to metaconceptual teaching interventions. The participants (45 high school students in the USA) were enrolled in one of the two physics classes instructed by the same science teacher. In the experimental group, students' engagement in metaconceptual knowledge and processes was facilitated through various instructional activities, including poster drawing, journal writing, group debate, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. These activities were intended to facilitate students' engagement in (a) becoming aware of their existing and past conceptions, associated beliefs, everyday experiences, and contextual differences, (b) monitoring their understanding of the new conception, the changes in ideas, and the consistency between existing and new conceptions, and (c) evaluating the relative ability of competing conceptions to explain a physical phenomenon. In the comparison group, the same content knowledge was explained by the teacher along with the use of laboratory experiments, demonstrations, and quantitative problem solving. Students' reactions to the designed instructional activities indicated that metaconceptual teaching interventions were successful in facilitating students' engagement in several types of metaconceptual functioning. The results showed that students in the experimental group had significantly better conceptual understanding than their counterparts in the comparison group and this positive impact remained after a period of 9 weeks. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2008.

AB  - Concept mapping is discussed as a means to promote meaningful learning and in particular progress in reading comprehension skills. Its increasing implementation necessitates the acquisition of adequate knowledge about frequent errors in order to make available an effective introduction to the new learning method. To analyse causes of errors, 283 A-level sixth graders produced concept maps about two differently complex subject matter lessons, we implemented in a pre-lesson. We defined six types of errors and analysed the distribution and contingency tables in both subject matters. Students in general produced more complex concept maps in the context of the easier subject matter (A) than that of the difficult content (B). Whereas in the former errors simply indicated knowledge gaps, in the latter they often reflected technical misconceptions. The occurrence of a content-dependent technical error in (B) pointed to a cognitive overload, since the more difficult content is hypothesised to cause higher intrinsic load. From this following, concept mapping could provoke an instructional enrichment by additionally revealing specific knowledge gaps. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study investigated how well 74 6th-grade science students represented text structures from a 900-word textbook chapter on soil conservation, given a concept map template with four superordinate terms and 24 unsorted concepts. Findings suggest students were more successful at classifying pre-selected terms under given superordinate categories than they were at fully identifying relevant concept sets and articulating three different relationship types between terms. No significant differences were noted in the mapping performance of students at different reading levels. About two-third of students indicated they enjoyed concept mapping and would prefer to both read and map rather than just read without mapping. Students also expressed a strong preference for mapping in pairs or small groups compared to mapping alone. Multiple recommendations are provided for improving the relational thinking of students tasked with concept mapping expository science texts, including bridging to more open-ended maps, embedding mapping in longer-term inquiry projects, and leveraging collaborative and tool-based scaffolds. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. 'The study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkalc University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment: of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators. © 2009 Eǧitim Damş manliǧi ve Araştirmalan Iletişim Hizmederi Tic.

AB  - When discussing the topic "Hunger in Africa" with students, incorrect and biased ideas on the causes for hunger are revealed. In order to change the students' personal concepts it is necessary to become acquainted with their mental models. Therefore, a survey of Geography students' different personal theories concerning "Hunger in Africa" was carried out. By means of interviews followed by concept mapping, the various personal theories were identified. It became apparent that the students mostly rely on climate and the population growth as arguments to explain the occurrence of hunger in Africa. The greatest difference between the personal and the scientific theories was that the students included almost no external influences, whether economic or political, in their explanations but relied mostly on factors within a country when formulating their statements. The research literature commonly suggests that there are three steps in reshaping learners' " misconceptions". The first is to make the present views explicitly the subject of the discussion. At this point the experiences that led to these views should be reflected on and newly interpreted. Second, the newly acquired knowledge must prove itself when used in certain contexts. Finally, during the process, a cooperative culture of learning must prevail, where the learner is convinced that he can control his own acquisition of knowledge. On the basis of these insights, teaching aids were developed that allow students to check their own personal concepts, to dismiss them and to align them with scientific concepts. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - This study describes how a group of grade 7 and 8 students in South Africa engaged with the notion of spatial scale in the Universe before, during and after a visit to an astronomy science centre. A limited amount of research has been conducted on this concept worldwide. Using a combination of concept maps, observations and interviews, results indicate that, despite contrary suggestions in the literature, students aged 13- to 15-years are able to improve their conceptions of size and distance from naïve and conflicting knowledge to a more scientific understanding after their visit. The findings also demonstrate, using a human constructivist framework, that students showed both weak and strong restructuring of knowledge. Experiences with size and distance also appeared to be important in the students' affective domain. The paper argues that a combination of related, themed experiences related to spatial scale can account for the improvement, and recommends that these and even more innovative activities should be explicitly promoted at science centres and in out-of-classroom activities. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A research program at Cornell University that sought to study the ability of first and second grade children to acquire basic science concepts and the affect of this learning on later schooling led to the need for a new tool to describe explicit changes in children's conceptual understanding. Concept mapping was invented in 1972 to meet this need, and subsequently numerous other uses have been found for this tool. Underlying the research program and the development of the concept mapping tool was an explicit cognitive psychology of learning and an explicit constructivist epistemology, described briefly in this paper. © 2009 Springer-Verlag US.

AB  - Our paper presents an in-service primary school teachers' training program which is based on the idea that the history of science can play a vital role in promoting the learning of physics. This training program has been developed in the context of Comenius 2.1 which is a European Union program. This program that we have developed in the University of Athens is based on socioconstructivist and sociocultural learning principles with the intention of helping teachers to appropriate the basic knowledge on the issue of falling bodies. Moreover, it has the aim to make explicit through the exploitation of authentic historical science events, on the above topic (Aristotle's, Galileo's and Newton's theories on falling bodies) the Nature of Science (NoS), the Nature of Learning (NoL) and the Nature of Teaching (NoT). During the implementation of the program we have used a variety of teaching strategies (e.g. group work, making of posters, making of concept maps, simulations) that utilize historical scientific materials on the issue of falling bodies. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - A method for uncovering students' thinking about thinking, specifically their meta-strategic knowledge, is explored within the context of an ongoing, multi-year intervention designed to promote the development of students' thinking dispositions. The development of a concept-map instrument that classroom teachers can use and an analytic framework for interpreting students' responses is presented. In a preliminary study, the concept map instrument is piloted to evaluate changes in students' conceptions of thinking after a year's participation in classrooms where their teachers actively sought to make thinking more visible by noticing and naming the thinking observed as well as introducing and using thinking routines (Ritchhart and Perkins. Educational Leadership, 65(5), 57-61 2008). Concept maps from 239 students from grades 3 through 11 were analyzed. Results suggest that students' conceptions of thinking do improve with age but also can be substantially developed through a classroom culture where thinking is modeled and rich opportunities for thinking are present. The concept map instrument itself proved to be a robust instrument for uncovering students' thinking about thinking. © Springer Science + Business Media, LLC 2009.

AB  - This paper describes the ongoing creation of instructional materials for a design-based research intervention that attempts to integrate humanitarian applications of engineering into existing coursework. Using a concept map based approach, a relational framework has been developed that highlights potential applications of engineering & technology in the developing world. Based on a well-known psychological theory of motivation, it illustrates the spectrum of engineering disciplines from the perspective of human needs. Related course modules on water treatment and absorption spectroscopy-based sensors have also been created, and a module on electric power system design is currently under development. Preliminary outcomes of piloting the materials suggest that undergraduate project-based courses lend themselves better to the approach than graduate level quantitative courses. While the materials are likely to benefit all students, indications of possible gender and preferred learning style differences will be of interest. It is hoped that this work will contribute a new perspective on the practice of engineering education with potential to attract and retain more diverse student populations. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called "Laboratory Experiments in Science Education" based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers' conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The understanding of complex physiological processes requires information from many different areas of knowledge. To meet this interdisciplinary scenario, the ability of integrating and articulating information is demanded. The difficulty of such approach arises because, more often than not, information is fragmented through under graduation education in Health Sciences. Shifting from a fragmentary and deep view of many topics to joining them horizontally in a global view is not a trivial task for teachers to implement. To attain that objective we proposed a course herein described Biochemistry of the envenomation response aimed at integrating previous contents of Health Sciences courses, following international recommendations of interdisciplinary model. The contents were organized by modules with increasing topic complexity. The full understanding of the envenoming pathophysiology of each module would be attained by the integration of knowledge from different disciplines. Active-learning strategy was employed focusing concept map drawing. Evaluation was obtained by a 30-item Likert-type survey answered by ninety students; 84% of the students considered that the number of relations that they were able to establish as seen by concept maps increased throughout the course. Similarly, 98% considered that both the theme and the strategy adopted in the course contributed to develop an interdisciplinary view.

AB  - The teaching/learning interview has been used to investigate student learning. The aim of the teaching/learning interview is to model a natural learning environment while allowing more direct access to a student's or group's thinking and reasoning. The interview typically involves one to four students working with a researcher'interviewer while being audio and video recorded. It has previously been reported [1] that the data collected in a teaching/learning interview is richer in detail than data collected in an actual classroom. We investigated the possibility that there were also other differences between these formats. We used the same instructional materials as well as pre-, mid- and post-tests in a teaching/learning interview and in a classroom laboratory setting. We will describe how the data collected in these two settings compare. © American Institute of Physics.

AB  - This paper discusses how techniques for representing knowledge, such as concept maps could be effectively used in a technical writing classroom for the conceptual understanding of a problem and as a visualization strategy for complex technical documents. The motivation behind using the knowledge models (concept maps) for an engineering/computer science oriented technical writing class is based on the importance of understanding different knowledge representations in an engineering / Computer Science document and the fact that the ease of solving such a problem is almost completely determined by ways in which problem is conceptualized and represented. In this project, we argue for the importance of using specific kinds of concept maps, such as ladders, in a technical writing class offered for computer science majors. A survey-based study with 25 students from a technical thesis writing class, reported in this article suggested that advanced students in an EFL technical thesis writing course have enough expertise to understand the use and application of specialized concept maps for technical document production activities. Results indicate that students, on most part, understand specific inference-based applications of concept maps in documents, tasks and especially specific sentences in the domain of computer science. Self-reports also indicated that students are reasonably confident about their ability to apply different types of concept maps in logical ways. Teaching evidence suggested that use of concept maps should be effectively integrated both during planning stages and as part of traditional document production techniques. Assignments and activities in a technical writing classroom (e.g., software manual design, quick guides, FAQ, brochures, lab reports etc) should address the use of concept maps for conceptualizing, schematizing and presenting procedural information logically and structurally. Using concept maps efficiently can lead to structural and functional conceptualization, visualization, representation and retention of complex information. The entire English curriculum in this institute designed as "English for computer science" involved students using concept maps from freshman to senior years for conceptualizing and articulating computer science concepts. © Common Ground, Debopriyo Roy.

AB  - To get at students' conceptual understandings of design and engineering activity, a group of graduate engineering students were asked to perform a series of drawing tasks. A group of first-year master's students in Mechanical Engineering enrolled in design project courses at Stanford University were asked to generate a concept map of their "typical design process" at the beginning and end of their course. Students were also asked to draw a designer at work and an engineer at work, along the lines of the Draw-a-Scientist Test. Initial findings from qualitative content analysis indicate that the concept maps of design process mature over time along a consistent learning trajectory. Students also have distinct but complimentary models of the roles of a designer and engineer along two emerging themes: idea generation vs. idea implementation and human-centered design vs. technology-centered. These intermediate results point to further study in this area. © 2009 IEEE.

AB  - The focus of this chapter is a role-play simulation unit within a college-level interdisciplinary science elective course for preservice teachers. The simulation utilized a United States Senate Subcommittee hearing to explore the use of Bt (Bacillus thuringiensis) genes in corn. Over an extended time period, students explored the material in depth, which incorporated a wide variety of teaching strategies and topics of current interest in science education (simulations, role-playing, driving questions, oral presentations, technology integration, portfolios, reflection, and concept mapping). The results demonstrated that this type of learning experience can significantly impact students' understanding of how science is applied to environmental problems. Furthermore, students developed a greater appreciation of the importance of examining the scientific, social, political, economic, and ethical dimensions of environmental issues. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to analyze the concepts of work-energy subject in 7th grade science course and the relations among them. Concept maps were used as a method of assessment and relationships between concepts of work-energy topic were examined using this way. The research was performed by contribution of 50 students within a period of 7 weeks. Each student formed his/her concept map related to the topic. These maps were assessed according to Novak's score system. The assessment was made with two raters and g coefficient was found as 0.97. Additionally work-energy achievement test was applied at the end of this process. Results obtained from the concept maps and the results of the test were compared. As a result, the correlation between the two assessment methods was computed as 0.416. The relationships between the concepts were examined deeply. Serious defects were determined in the linking words in the concept maps of the students. © 2009 Asian Network for Scientific Information.

AB  - From the authors observations and those of Kinchin (2001) teachers may know about concept mapping but they do not seem to use it as a consistent, effective strategy. The authors argue that the concept mapping may be better understood by using an expanded definition of traditional literacy, listening, speaking, reading and writing; to include visualizing, visual representation, and technological literacy Sinatra (1986). This ethnographic case study examines the use of concept mapping and collaborative learning strategies in the content area of marine ecology in high school science classrooms. To support students' understanding of science concept and the improvement of writing students began with a field trip to study inter-coastal zones and follow-up laboratory activities, use of digital image analysis, and collaborative group work. Key vocabulary were identified to begin concept maps, and more vocabulary was added to support multiple revisions of concept maps with concept map software, and culminated with students' writing. Concept mapping integrated with collaborative learning was used to engage students to construct and re-construct their understanding of a complex scientific concept, the energy cycle. The results showed that students benefited from the combination of collaborative learning and concept maps to focus their writing on key ideas, to organize their ideas, and include specific details. However, the interpretation and integration of quantitative data and laboratory results was not as consistent. Most importantly, initial concept maps and revisions provided the teacher with evidence of student learning in the form of formative assessment products, to guide teachers' focused feedback and clarify specific ideas for re-teaching, as well as students' self-assessment. The authors provide examples of concept maps and graphic organizers as formative assessment of students' knowledge, what Novak (1998) calls heuristic or "facilitative tools," and as visual representations and structures to provide flexible ways supporting learners' meaningful learning through speaking, writing and in visual forms (Sinatra, 2000; Mintzes, Wandersee, and Novak, 2004). © 2010, IGI Global.

AB  - Problem Statement: : Students' meaningful understanding of scientific concepts and topics has a major consideration in order for science education programmes' to attain their goals. The effectiveness of science instruction, which aims to assure students' complete and accurate understanding of science concepts, can only be effectively evaluated when it is measured with appropriate tools of measurement. Concept maps, multiple-choice tests and interviews, all of which are employed in determining students' understanding of science concepts, have been supported as successful methods. However, each has its own limitations. In determining students' understanding of concepts, the use of two-tier diagnostic tests - which evaluate students' understanding better and which are easy to score and apply - is recommended. The items in two-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instruments are specifically designed to identify alternative conceptions and misunderstandings in a limited and clearly defined content area. Compared with the other approaches, two-tier tests are a more advanced approach as they consider students' reasons and interpretations for their answers. Moreover, it is stated that, two-tier tests are valid and reliable instruments which evaluate student ideas better, which are easy to score and apply. Genetics is one of the biology topics that students have most difficulty in understanding. Researches demonstrate that most teachers and students hold the view that genetics topics are very difficult both to learn and to teach. Researches into determining students' understanding of genetics concepts show that students have some lack and confused knowledge on understanding these concepts, their functions and their relations. Purpose of Study: Most genetics concepts have an imaginary and theoretical characteristic. Students' learning of theoretical genetics concepts meaningfully depends on knowing hypothetical reasons of these concepts. Investigation into students' knowledge regarding genetics concepts as well as reasons on which they base their knowledge is bound to generate significant and effective consequences in determining their understanding. Therefore, this research aims to develop a two-tier test which determines secondary education students' understanding of genetics concepts, and to conduct validity and reliability studies of the test. Methods: The two-tier test directed to determining students' understanding of fundamental genetics concepts was developed by pursuing a 10-step method containing 3 main phases. First phase is about defining the content; second phase about obtaining information on students' misunderstandings, and third one is about the development of the two-tier test. In first phase, test content was defined by propositional knowledge statements and a concept map. Afterwards, propositional knowledge statements were associated with concept map; and thus the internal consistent of the content was examined. In second phase, firstly relevant literature was examined so as to determine students' misunderstandings. And secondly semi-structured interviews were conducted with 21 students in order to gain a deeper perspective of students' understanding. And later they were given a multiple choice test with free-response answers in which students had to explain reasons for their answers. In third phase, two-tier test items that were composed of multiple choice content questions in first tier and in second tier a set of five justifications for all potentially selected responses to first tier were developed. The two-tier test is intended to determine students' understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetics and the relations between them as well as the relation of cell divisions with inheritance. This test is composed of two-tier 14 items. It is multiple-choice type in both tiers, and the number of choices is 3 in first tier and 5 in second tier. In order to consider a question as correctly answered, it needs to be answered correctly in both content and reason tiers. Research was conducted with 231 secondary education students. The age range of research group students was between 16 and 19. Of the group, 118 (51.1%) were girls and 113 (48.9%) were boys. Students attended Anatolian high schools, State high schools, and high schools with an intensive foreign language programme, where the same biology curriculum had been applied. The data obtained from two-tier test application were made subject to item analysis and test analysis. Following analyses, difficulty and discrimination of items, functionality of distracters and test reliability were determined. Answers were sought to two basic questions for the purposes of validity determination: first, whether or not the items measured the content that was defined by propositional knowledge statements; and second whether or not the items were suitable to the level of the research group. Expert opinion was consulted for content validity, and was checked with propositional knowledge statements as well as with concept map. A specification grid was designed in order to determine face validity. As to construct validity, the method of group differences was utilized. Findings and Results: After conducting item analysis difficulty and discrimination indices of each item were calculated. Item discrimination indices were found to between 0.34 and 0.74. These values demonstrated that items functioned in a satisfactory way. And item difficulty indices were between 0.25 and 0.67, and had a distribution in a large interval. Test mean was found as 6.02 and test difficulty as 0.43. Test reliability was found to be 0.86. The functionality of distracters analyses showed that distracters functioned well and that there was no need for modifications in choices. In order to determine construct validity, correlation between the data obtained from students of Anatolian high schools and state high schools plus high schools with an intensive foreign language programme was calculated, and was found to be 0.169. The fact that this value was low was an indicator of test construct validity. Conclusions: All the findings obtained from the item analysis, validity and reliability analyses of two-tier test indicate that this test could be used reliably and in a valid way to determine secondary school students' understanding of genetics concepts. Findings also show that students performed better when only first part of items was considered, than when both parts of items were considered. This indicates that students have selected the correct content response through rote learning without an understanding of the underlying reasons. Recommendations: The fact that the test is a multiple-choice type makes it easy to apply and to score for teachers. In addition, thanks to the availability of reason questions, teachers will be able to evaluate students' understanding of concepts more effectively. When effectively used, these tests are likely to contribute to students' deeper understanding of science concepts. © 2009.

AB  - At the microscopic level, there are many concepts that appear too complicated to all grades of students; especially those concerning chemical reactions. Most students have difficulty in imagining things and understanding the relevant concepts. In science, activity-based learning is deemed an appropriate method to improve students' understanding of complicated concepts. The purpose of this study was to develop an inquiry-based learning unit on chemical reaction for grade eight students by using a newly developed activity called "Tapioca Bomb" for demonstrating concepts of chemical reaction. The students had opportunities to investigate by hands-on and mind-on activities. After observing the explosion in the Tapioca Bomb activity, the students were able to build their own concepts on chemical reaction and connect science learning to everyday life. The students could explain how and why the reaction occurred, and could apply their preliminary knowledge to design their own experiment. Finally, the teacher and students discussed what they had learned and applied the knowledge gained. The results on pre-test and post-test, concept map, students' documents, CLES questionnaire and interviews indicated that this learning unit helped students conceptualize the knowledge on combustion chemical reaction. © Common Ground, Wasana Keeratichamroen, Precharn Dechsri, Bhinyo Panijpan, Pintip Ruenwongsa.

AB  - Correlation is an essential concept in statistics; however, students may hold misconceptions about correlation, even after receiving instruction. This study aimed to elucidate (1) the misconceptions held by senior high school students about correlation, using the tool of concept mapping along with interviewing, (2) the possible causes of these misconceptions, and (3) the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of the adopted concept mapping using an interviewing technique for identifying student misconceptions. Twenty-five grade-12 students who had received tuition on correlation were the subjects of this study. Concept mapping through interviewing was used to collect and analyze data in order to identify the subjects' misconceptions, and their possible causes. The major study results are as follows. (1) Seven misconceptions about correlation were detected. Of these seven misconceptions, five were newly discovered by this study, while the other two are similar to those found by previous studies. Each of the seven misconceptions was held by 20-68% of the subjects, showing their prevalence and significance. (2) Four major factors related to the development of misconceptions about correlation were identified: learning materials, language, daily-life experiences, and existing mathematical concepts. (3) The concept mapping through the interviewing technique adopted in this study was effective in detecting misconceptions about statistics, especially in revealing new misconceptions, and it was also helpful in exploring their possible causes. However, tremendous effort and the time consumed are the major limitations of this technique. (4) The paper concluded by providing some recommendations for researchers and educators. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2008.

AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that paves the way to represent knowledge schematically. In this research, concept mapping was used as an assessment method on the impulse-momentum topic. The purpose of this study was to determine teacher candidates' knowledge about understanding of the concepts of impulse and momentum by comparing and contrasting two different methods; namely, students' concept maps and an achievement test. The mean of teacher candidates' concept map scores are extremely low when compared with the scores of the achievement test. In addition, it was seen that although a great number of concepts were written down, not many relationships were established between these concepts. There is a weak correlation between the achievement test and the concept map scores since concept maps assess the students' knowledge from a conceptual perspective while the achievement tests measure the level of students' knowledge on the topic and his/her ability to apply this knowledge on different occasions. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - The objective of this study is to identify the granularity differences as well as similarity between large biomedical ontologies through rules. Two anatomical ontologies were selected, and based on a set of concept mappings obtained through simple string matching techniques, we constructed rules to distinguish among different types of subclasses and classifications. 82% of the concept mappings have exactly the same classification in subclasses between the two ontologies. Other mappings are classified in different granularity, including additional subclasses, detailed classification, and different intermediate classification concepts. Using rules and the rule inference engine enables an automatic and scalable investigation of the structural incompatibility among biomedical ontologies.

AB  - Citation analysis has become a proven tool in research evaluation and policy relevant studies. Recently, J.E. Hirsch has suggested a new indicator, one single index for the assessment of the research performance of individual scientists. In a short time, Hirsch' definition was easily adapted to citations of journals and articles. The aim of this study is to discuss both what Hirsch index evolution explains us for Journal of Biological Education (JBE) and biological educational subjects which affect h-index of that journal. A case study is conducted for the h-index of JBE over period 2000-2005. By the term variable citation window h-index it meant that it was considered as a fixed moment in time when citations were collected from Web of Science. The evolution of JBE Hirsch index is shown with the self citations and the elimination of journal self citations in related figures. From the data, the Pearson correlation coefficients of regression lines are determined. The quantitative findings show that the h-index evolution of JBE has a positive trend determined in the case of the self and elimination self-citations of the journal over period 2000-2005. Furthermore, the most cited articles are about understanding of students on biological subjects, developing concept mapping in biology and students' attitutes towards biology teaching.

AB  - We used four different methods to determine the best means of assessing over 200 preservice elementary teachers' growth in knowledge of models and their use in K-8 classrooms while participating in the Science Capstone course that focused on the unifying themes of models in science. Each assessment method probed a different aspect of models (from growth in scientific use to need for greater emphasis on the role and use of models) and each used a different method of gathering student responses (Likert-type responses to concept maps). We determined that growth in student knowledge was demonstrated by all instruments, but some instruments were more useful than others for determining preservice elementary teachers' prior knowledge as well as growth in knowledge of models necessary for K-8 teachers. © National Science Council, Taiwan (2009).

AB  - Two experiments investigated the effects of characteristic features of concept mapping used for prior knowledge activation. Characteristic demands of concept mapping include connecting lines representing the relationships between concepts and labeling these lines, specifying the type of the semantic relationships. In the first experiment, employing a within-subjects design, 20 psychology students completed a label-provided-lines economics mapping task and then a create-and-label-lines meteorology mapping task or vice versa. The analysis of 40 think-aloud protocols indicated more elaboration processes for the label-provided-lines task than for the create-and-label-lines task. On the other hand, the protocols indicated more model-construction psychology students were randomly assigned to either a label-provided-lines mapping task or a create-and-label-lines mapping task. Subsequently, both groups completed a learning phase in a hypertext environment and a posttest. Results showed substantial differences in learning outcomes and perceived self-efficacy in favor of the label-provided-lines prior knowledge activation task. The findings are congruent with coherence effects found in text-comprehension research and support the position that concept mapping should not be seen as a unitary method but be differentiated according to the specific tasks to be completed. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Maps of the world are common in classroom settings. They are used to teach the juxtaposition of natural and political functions, mineral resources, political, cultural and geographical boundaries; occurrences of processes such as tectonic drift; spreading of epidemics; and weather forecasts, among others. Recent work in scientometrics aims to create a map of science encompassing our collective scholarly knowledge. Maps of science can be used to see disciplinary boundaries; the origin of ideas, expertise, techniques, or tools; the birth, evolution, merging, splitting, and death of scientific disciplines; the spreading of ideas and technology; emerging research frontiers and bursts of activity; etc. Just like the first maps of our planet, the first maps of science are neither perfect nor correct. Today's science maps are predominantly generated based on English scholarly data: Techniques and procedures to achieve local and global accuracy of these maps are still being refined, and a visual language to communicate something as abstract and complex as science is still being developed. Yet, the maps are successfully used by institutions or individuals who can afford them to guide science policy decision making, economic decision making, or as visual interfaces to digital libraries. This paper presents the process and results of creating hands-on science maps for kids that teaches children ages 4-14 about the structure of scientific disciplines. The maps were tested in both formal and informal science education environments. The results show that children can easily transfer their (world) map and concept map reading skills to utilize maps of science in interesting ways. © 2009 SPIE-IS&T.

AB  - The researchers investigated the comparative effects of individually-constructed and collaboratively-constructed computer-based concept mapping on middle school science concept learning. One hundred and sixty one students completed the entire study. Using prior science performance scores to assure equivalence of student achievement across groups, students were assigned to three groups: a self-selected study strategy group, an individual-concept mapping group, and a collaborative pairs - concept mapping group. Collaboratively and individually-constructing computer-based concept maps had equally positive effects on seventh grade middle school science concept learning as measured on a comprehension test. However, the students who collaboratively constructed concept maps created significantly higher quality concept maps than those who individually constructed concept maps indicating deeper conceptual understanding. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of relationships among concepts. Willis and Miertschin suggested the use of technology-based concept mapping as an active learning strategy that can enhance learning and thinking skills, particularly among students native to a digital environment [16]. In addition, modern concept mapping software tools enable instructors and students to create visual navigation structures through complex knowledge domains. The authors find value in visual navigation structures for their relevance to organizing and simplifying learning environments and for their appeal to visual learners. This paper investigates different ways to develop digital interactive concept maps (CMaps) to help students navigate complex knowledge domains, such as the content of a course or a curriculum. CMaps can be used to present information in a nonsequential way or in several different ways, depending on the need. Interactivity enables students to easily locate digital information artifacts pertinent to a concept (media files, slide presentations, web pages, etc.) by clicking on links associated with a CMap node representing the course concept or category. A review of recent literature is provided, different software tools are compared, and the authors document their personal experience.

AB  - Concept Mapping is a technique that allows information visualization. A Concept Map is a graphical way of representing and organizing knowledge. It is comprised of nodes and links, arranged in some spatial distribution to reflect the domain information. Nodes represent concepts, and links represent the relationship between concepts; both concepts and links are labeled and may be categorized. Inside the educational area concept maps can be used for supporting learning, for assessing learning, and also for organizing and presenting information. Introduction to Artificial Intelligence is a compulsory subject studied at the first term of the Computer Science degree in the University of the Basque Country. In this work a study carried out by 6 voluntary students with the aim of organizing ah the learning resources (theoretical contents, laboratories, exercises,...) related to that subject by means of a concept map is presented. CM-ED is the Concept Map EDitor used to fulfill this objective. Representing the variety of learning resources related to the subject in a visual format makes it easier their organization and their later visualization and searching. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Measures of student learning are the only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching with technology. The paper will look at a number of frameworks for evaluating e-learning. It will outline some of the implications for using these frameworks to evaluate student learning and will describe the advantages of using concept mapping to measure the quality of e-learning. It will present a study where medical students interacted with e-learning materials designed to teach Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The results show that many of the student misconceptions were addressed in the course of their learning, but also, that many of the key concepts introduced in the teaching were simply ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote) by the students. These must be acknowledged in the design of electronic teaching materials.

AB  - This paper assesses the usefulness of concept mapping (an educational learning, assessment, and curriculum development technique developed by Novak, widely used in the natural sciences) within an accounting education context. It shows how an accounting-based concept map can be constructed by students and educators to provide a visual, conceptually transparent graphical representation of an individual's understanding of a particular knowledge domain. The method is firmly routed in Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning and its emphasis upon the hierarchical structure of concepts is particularly relevant to accounting. While concept mapping has been used extensively in many (particularly science) disciplines, it has received relatively little attention within accounting education. The paper's contribution is to extend its application within an accounting education context by focusing upon how concept mapping can enhance students' learning by evaluating student-prepared concept maps, showing how concept mapping can be used at different levels within a course (i.e. curriculum, topic and activity) and reporting feedback of its use with two cohorts of students, within a financial accounting theory component. The use of educator-prepared concept maps, with concepts omitted, proved popular as tutorial quiz exercises and increased the quantity and quality of participation. However, students were less willing to construct their own concept maps and engage in meaningful learning. While most students were able to build upon aspects of their prior knowledge, stronger students used a greater range of concepts, a richer set of linkages and more examples than weaker students did. Concept maps were useful in diagnosing students' and instructors' misconceptions. Many students found concept mapping relatively easy to use, provided a better understanding of complex issues, liked the visual representation and holistic view, and so supported their learning. However, educators need to become proficient in constructing maps and using appropriate software, not make the maps too complex, provide students with some initial training in the technique and consider the fit between using the techniques as a learning tool and as an assessment tool. While no significant differences were found in the usefulness of the method for students of different ages and gender, Asian students generally found the method to be more useful than did UK students. © 2007, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The aim of this paper was to describe the changes in one student's ideas about force and one-dimensional motion concepts and portray the relevant metaconceptual processes that she engaged in during the implementation of metaconceptual teaching interventions. Metaconceptual processes involves metacognitive processes that are directly acting on or related to individuals' conceptions, mental models or elements of their conceptual ecology. Several types of instructional activities including poster drawing, concept mapping, group debate, journal writing and group and class discussions were used to activate students' metaconceptual processes. The findings of the study indicated that the student changed all of her alternative ideas that were assessed before the instruction with scientifically accepted conceptions following the instruction. The findings also showed that the student engaged in several types of metaconceptual processes ranging from simple awareness of ideas to more sophisticated metaconceptual processes, such as metaconceptual monitoring and evaluation. The findings strengthen the claims about the positive impact of metaconceptual processes on changing students' conceptions of physical world. Copyright © 2007 by Moment.

AB  - Emerging from a human constructivist view of learning and a punctuated model of conceptual change, these studies explored differences in the structural complexity and content validity of knowledge about prehistoric life depicted in concept maps by learners ranging in age from approximately 10 to 20 years. Study 1 (cross-age) explored the frequencies of concepts, relationships, levels of hierarchy, branching, and cross-links in concept maps drawn by students in grades 5, 8, 11, 13, and 14. The results provide some support for a punctuated model of conceptual change. Study 2 (longitudinal) explored the same frequencies on repeated occasions among students enrolled in a college course on prehistoric life, and documented the shift in frequencies of "novice" and "expert" concepts occurring during the semester. The results suggest that college students engage in much restructuring of their knowledge frameworks during the period of a semester. Together, the two studies raise questions about common classroom practices that encourage the rote learning of biology and geology concepts at all levels. © 2006 National Science Council.

AB  - A concept map consists of nodes representing concepts and links representing the relationships between the concepts. To examine the influence of concept mapping on learning from texts, we varied the support strategies. Eighty students either learned by constructing concept maps on their own, by correcting an incorrect worked-out map, or by studying a correct worked-out map. A control group did not engage in any follow-up activity for learning from text. As expected, learners profited most from studying the correct worked-out map. Students who corrected an incorrect worked-out map did not have a better learning result than students who generated concept maps on their own or the control group. On the contrary, they produced many false conclusions in the comprehension test.

AB  - In recent years, the Internet has become an effective and accessible delivery mechanism for distance education. In 2003, 81% of all institutions of higher education offered at least one fully online or hybrid course. By 2005, the proportion of institutions that listed online education as important to their long-term goals had increased by 8%. This growth in available online courses and their increased convenience and flexibility have stimulated dramatic increases in enrollment in online programs, including the Veterinary Technology Distance Learning Program (VT-DLP) at Purdue University. Regardless of the obvious benefits, distance learning (DL) can be frustrating for the learners if course developers are unable to merge their knowledge about the learners, the process of instructional design, and the appropriate uses of technology and interactivity options into effective course designs. This article describes strategies that we have used to increase students' learning of physiology content in an online environment. While some of these are similar, if not identical, to strategies that might be used in a face-to-face (f2f) environment (e.g., case studies, videos, concept maps), additional strategies (e.g., animations, virtual microscopy) are needed to replace or supplement what might normally occur in a f2f course. We describe how we have addressed students' need for instructional interaction, specifically in the context of two foundational physiology courses that occur early in the VT-DLP. Although the teaching and learning strategies we have used have led to increasingly high levels of interaction, there is an ongoing need to evaluate these strategies to determine their impact on students' learning of physiology content, their development of problem-solving skills, and their retention of information. © 2007 AAVMC.

AB  - To examine the effects of the use of podcasting in the learning of scientific English in the university setting, this study was conducted in two English scientific listening and speaking classes taught by the researcher-teacher at a medical university in Taipei, TAIWAN from November to December 2007. Podcasts on science were used as learning materials. Learning outcome assessments include concept-mapping, oral tests, and scientific essay writing. Students' use of tools: PCs, MP3s, and MP4s, their frequency, duration, and location of use, and motivation and learning attitude were assessed by questionnaires. Experimental results show that due to the activation of higher-order thinking and cognitive engagement, deep learning was facilitated in students' learning processes. Besides, a preference of using MP3s for the learning of scientific English and a preference of using MP4s for deep learning of science and scientific English were identified in this study. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - This research aims to identify how students associate concepts about chemical equilibrium in General Chemistry Course and analyses the relationship between the concept maps developed by students and their problem-solving beliefs. The research was carried out at two stages with 60 university students divided into two equal groups. While group one prepared the concept maps with created linking phrases (KBC) at stage one, selected linking phrases (VBC) were used by those in group two. At stage two, only group one was given linking phrases forconstructing the concept map, the other group created their phrase. The research data was collected by means of concept maps prepared at both stages and a problem-solving belief scale. The research revealed that the concept maps prepared with selected linking phrases proved tobe more satisfactory. A statistically no significant relationship was found between concept mapping and problem-solving beliefs.

AB  - The development of analogical reasoning has traditionally been understood in terms of theories of adult competence. This approach emphasizes structured representations and structure mapping. In contrast, we argue that by taking a developmental perspective, analogical reasoning can be viewed as the product of a substantially different cognitive ability - relational priming. To illustrate this, we present a computational (here connectionist) account where analogy arises gradually as a by-product of pattern completion in a recurrent network. Initial exposure to a situation primes a relation that can then be applied to a novel situation to make an analogy. Relations are represented as transformations between states. The network exhibits behaviors consistent with a broad range of key phenomena from the developmental literature, lending support to the appropriateness of this approach (using low-level cognitive mechanisms) for investigating a domain that has normally been the preserve of high-level models. Furthermore, we present an additional simulation that integrates the relational priming mechanism with deliberative controlled use of inhibition to demonstrate how the framework can be extended to complex analogical reasoning, such as the data from explicit mapping studies in the literature on adults. This account highlights how taking a developmental perspective constrains the theory construction and cognitive modeling processes in a way that differs substantially from that based purely on adult studies, and illustrates how a putative complex cognitive skill can emerge out of a simple mechanism. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.

AB  - Nursing theory challenges students to think abstractly and is often a difficult introduction to graduate study. Traditionally, concept analysis is useful in facilitating this abstract thinking. Concept maps are a way to visualize an individual's knowledge about a specific topic. Serial concept maps express the sequential evolution of a student's perceptions of a selected concept. Maps reveal individual differences in learning and perceptions, as well as progress in understanding the concept. Relationships are assessed and suggestions are made during serial mapping, which actively engages the students and faculty in dialogue that leads to increased understanding of the link between nursing theory and practice. Serial concept mapping lends itself well to both online and traditional classroom environments.

AB  - In this article, we argue for the importance of using concept maps in an advanced technical reading class offered for computer science students. This article presents a strong argument that use of concept maps should be inte grated effectively with traditional document conceptualization and production techniques. Assignments based on designing concept maps in a technical reading classroom should address the use of knowledge models like concept maps and should be integrated effectively with technical writing assignments. This study reports that readers think concept maps and the associated software are effective tools for comprehending technical details, and they prefer to use various strategies (when they are part of the class design) to dissect the technical text to be used in concept maps. Readers' self-reports also suggested that readers used concept maps for a variety of reasons. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - The abilities of the improvement of creative attitude, the power of aesthetical and practical estimations, productivity and thinking with assets are acquired in the courses of art education in the primary schools. Also students are able to find self-expressing and self-identy opportinities in these courses. The art education in the primary schools constitutes one of the most difficult fields to learn and instruct. There are two main viewpoints in the art education. One of them is education education by means applied model arising by visual components, an affective and sensitive experience. The other is mental and conceptual weighted model. The instruction of mental and conceptual weighted lessons of art education in the primary schools is consist of art historical, aesthical and critical field subjects. It is thought that there are inadequacies on effective and sufficient instraction of art historical, aesthetical and critical field subjects. Sufficient and effectiveness of mind-maps on learning must be studied. The main purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of the use of mind-maps on the courses of art education in the primary schools. 7th grade students in the primary schools in the academic year of 2006-2007 constitute the universe of the study. 68 students in 7/A and 7/B of Kazim Karabekir Primary School, the county of Eskisehir constitutes the sample of the study. Pre-test/post-test control model was used in this study and data were collected from the sample of the study by an oversee-test. The knowledge of students related to trends of modern art subject in the scope of art history was measured by this test including 30 questions. After pre-test and post-test points of the experiment and control groups were acquired, the average points and standard deviation were computed, "t test" was used on the comparasons between the groups and 0.05 confidence degree was taken as the significant degree. "SPSS 11 for Winows" software was used in all statistical analysis.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss how students enrolled in a conceptual physics class for future elementary school teachers progress through the CoMPASS (Concept Map Project-based Activity Scaffolding System) curriculum for inclined planes. The curriculum challenges students to design the best inclined plane to lift a pool table into a van. We have found that students typically predict the correct type of board (long and smooth) to complete the challenge, but their responses include evidence of both physics and everyday reasoning. After working through the materials, the majority of students understand the relationship between distance and force in the inclined plane as well as why the inclined plane is useful to lift heavy objects. However, students have difficulty both relating a plane's steepness to the force required to pull an object and discussing work in a scientifically correct manner. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

The study was set in the context of a five-year National Science Foundation funded teacher retention and renewal professional development project. In this project both beginning and experienced teachers are supported as they increase their understanding about mathematics, their ability to implement effective mathematics practices in their classrooms, and their knowledge of working with English Learners. Results indicate that teachers' algebraic knowledge structures became more complex and connected as a result of their professional development. In addition, they were able to adapt their knowledge networks to incorporate important aspects of algebra into them. Concept maps are recommended to other leaders of mathematics professional development as a means of assessing change. © Springer Science+Business Media, Inc. 2007.

AB  - Although researchers in higher education propose alternatives to traditional approaches to assessment, traditional methods are commonly used in college or university science courses. The purpose of this study was to explore the feasibility and validity of Prospective Science Teachers' (PSTs) concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach to describe the changes in the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in general chemistry laboratory investigations. After the PSTs (n = 47) decided on important issues, such as who would assess their concept maps and what scoring strategy and criteria would be used, they practiced assessing their own and peers' concept maps during the first five laboratory investigations. They subsequently constructed and assessed pre- and post-laboratory concept maps in a student-centred approach consisting of self, peer, and instructor assessments for the five remaining laboratory investigations. The results of the study showed using pre- and post-laboratory concept maps as authentic assessment tools in a student-centred approach was valid and reliable for describing the conceptual understanding of the PSTs in a university general chemistry laboratory course. The results of individual interviews indicated most PSTs had positive views of their assessment practices in the laboratory course. This study also provides pedagogical implications for the training of science teachers. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.

AB  - The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20 multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test. The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - Learning with self-explaining examples is an effective method in well-structured domains. We analyzed this method in teaching the complex skill of argumentation. In an experiment we compared three conditions (n = 47 students of educational sciences) that differed with respect to whether and how the processing of the examples was supported by different help functions. The analysis of the video-based examples was either supported by additional examples displaying the equivalent argumentative structure or by Conceptmaps visualizing the argumentative structure. The control group received no help. We found that examples of argumentation could be successfully employed in order to teach skills of argumentation. Covariance Analysis revealed no main effect of help design on learning outcome. However there was a significant effect of learners' help seeking activities. Learners who used the help facilities more often showed significant higher learning outcomes. Principal based help facilities (concept maps) thereby were most accepted by the learners.

AB  - Concept Map (CMap) is a graphical knowledge representation system, which has received growing popularity as a teaching and evaluation tool. In CMaps knowledge is represented by linking concepts to one another and specifying the nature of their relationship on the link. A pair of concepts connected with a linking phrase is called proposition. In general, knowledge is organized by relating different concepts to one another. We argue that there are two types of conceptual relationships: static and dynamic. The static relationship organizes knowledge by grouping similar items under the same concept and noting the belongingness of the concept to a more abstract construct as a super-ordinate or identifying its own sub-categories. For example, category "chair" is a part of a superordinate category "furniture" and may have sub-categories of "lawn chair" and "dining room chair." In addition, static meaningful relationships could be based on intersecting two constructs from different domains. For example, "design" and "chair" may be intersected by noting that "chair" requires "design." Organization of knowledge based on static relationships often results in hierarchical arrangement of concepts, which is very typical of most Concept Maps. On the other hand, the dynamic relationships reflect how change in one concept affects another concept. The emphasis is on showing the functional interdependency between concepts. For example, "increase in the amount of gasoline consumption" results in "increase in the level of carbon dioxide in the environment." The dynamic relationships have played an important role in the advancement of physical sciences. For example, Newton invented calculus as a representation system for dynamic relationships. Similarly, we argue that Concept Maps need the capability for representing dynamic relationships. However, CMap, in its traditional form, primarily encourages static thinking. In this chapter we, on one hand, bring attention to this tendency and, on the other hand, discuss the strategies teachers can use to encourage dynamic thinking with Concept Maps. These strategies include: • imposing a cyclic map structure instead of hierarchical arrangement of concepts, • quantifying the root concept of the map instead of a static category, and • reformulating the focus question of the map from "what" to "how." We discuss theoretical issues and empirical evidence in support of the proposed strategies. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - A survey of a large number of well-known textbooks for an undergraduate dynamics class showed that often new concepts are introduced without a clear connection to previously discussed material. For example, the concepts of work done by a force, linear momentum, angular momentum, and power are often introduced without a clear direct connection to Newton's law. Similarly, in rigid body dynamics, important concepts such as the center of mass and the moments of inertia of the body are often introduced with little or no background. This article shows how all the important concepts in dynamics flow directly and logically from Newton's laws. This is done through simple direct derivations. Connections are made clear by concept maps that help students understand how these different concepts are related. In addition to introducing new concepts and deriving some of the basic equations, a dynamics class should also introduce students to problem solving help them develop a systematic approach. This article describes a five step approach that is recommended for both high context and low context problems. In that context we stress that problem solving is a process that involves the application of known concepts and mathematics. Copyright © 2007 by ASME.

AB  - We previously reported how the opinions of second-year dentistry students and faculty members can be used to construct an assessment rubric to grade group-based concept maps in physiology (14). This article describes the second phase of this study of the subsequent year's cohort. A case study approach was used to investigate how groups of students used the criteria to complete their complex concept maps. Students' opinions about the assessment task and newly constructed rubric were sampled. Opinions across groups were correlated to academic achievements in the course. Two groups of four students volunteered to be videorecorded during a 4-h workshop, during which they completed their maps. The mapping task was not generally favored by students. However, those students who did favor the task achieved higher academic grades. Most students favored the newly constructed assessment rubric, commenting that it was easy to understand, fair, and appropriate, but reported that extra guidance from tutors and other resources were required. Coded videorecordings of the two observation groups revealed complex interactions around the three criteria of content, logic and understanding, and presentation. Two broad patterns of working were identified. One group distributed their efforts more evenly across the criteria, whereas the other group completed their maps by addressing the criteria in stages. These findings clearly indicate the academic challenges and social complexity in how students work in groups to complete complex concept maps in physiology. Copyright © 2008 The American.

AB  - Even though comprehension of human physiology is crucial in the clinical setting, students frequently learn part of this subject using rote memory and then are unable to transfer knowledge to other contexts or to solve clinical problems. This study evaluated the impact of articulating the concept map strategy with the mediated learning experience on meaningful learning during the cardiovascular module of a medical physiology course at Universidad Autónoma de Bucaramanga. This research was based on the ideas of David Ausubel (meaningful learning), Joseph Novak (concept maps), and Reuven Feuerstein (mediated learning experience). Students were randomly allocated to either an intervention group (mediated learning experience articulated with concept mapping) or a control group (traditional methodology). The intervention group constructed concept maps related to cardiovascular physiology and used them to solve problems related to this subject. The control group attended traditional discussion sessions and problem-solving sessions. All students were evaluated with two types of exams: problem-solving and multiple-choice exams. The intervention group performed significantly better on the problem-solving exams, but the difference was not significant in the multiple-choice exam. It was concluded that intervention promoted meaningful learning that allowed the students to transfer this knowledge to solve problems. The implemented strategy had a greater impact on the students who came into the study with the lowest cognitive competence, possibly because they were empowered by the intervention.

AB  - Change and complexity are creating a need for increasing levels of literacy in science and technology. Presently, we are beginning to provide students with clear contexts in which to learn, including clearly written text, visual displays and maps, and more effective instruction. We are also beginning to give students tools that promote their own literacy by helping them to interact with the learning context. These tools include peer-group skills as well as strategies to analyze text and to indicate comprehension by way of text summaries and concept maps. Even with these tools, more appears to be needed. Disparate backgrounds and languages interfere with the comprehension and the sharing of knowledge. To meet this need, two new tools are proposed. The first tool fractures language ontologically, giving all learners who use it a language to talk about what has, and what has not, been uttered in text or talk about the world. The second fractures language epistemologically, giving those involved in working with text or on the world around them a way to talk about what they have done and what remains to be done. Together, these tools operate as a two- tiered knowledge representation of knowledge. This representation promotes both an individual meta-cognitive and a social meta-cognitive approach to what is known and to what is not known, both ontologically and epistemologically. Two hypotheses guide the presentation: If the tools are taught during early childhood, children will be prepared to master science and technology content. If the tools are used by both students and those who design and deliver instruction, the learning of such content will be accelerated. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.

AB  - The skill set required of biomedical researchers continues to grow and evolve as biology matures as a natural science. Science necessitates creative yet critical thinking, persuasive communication skills, purposeful use of time, and adeptness at the laboratory bench. Teaching these skills can be effectively accomplished in an inquiry-based, active-learning environment at a primarily undergraduate institution. Cell Biology Techniques, an upper-level cell biology laboratory course at St. John Fisher College, features two independent projects that take advantage of the biology of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a premier yet simple model organism. First, students perform a miniature epigenetic screen for novel phenotypes using RNA interference. The results of this screen combined with literature research direct students toward a singe gene that they attempt to subclone in the second project. The biology of the chosen gene/protein also becomes an individualized focal point with respect to the content of the laboratory. Progress toward course goals is evaluated using written, oral, and group-produced assignments, including a concept map. Pre- and postassessment indicates a significant increase in the understanding of broad concepts in cell biological research. © 2008 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of using the cooperative concept mapping (CCM) teaching approach on secondary school students' motivation in biology. A non equivalent control group design under the quasi-experimental research was used in which a random sample of four co-educational secondary schools was used. The four schools were randomly assigned to four groups. Each school provided one Form Two class. The study sample comprised of 156 second grade students in the secondary school cycle (Form Two students) in Gucha District, Kenya. Students in all the groups were taught the same biology content but two groups, the experimental groups, were taught using the CCM approach while the other two, the control groups, were taught using regular teaching methods. Two groups, one experimental and one control, were pre-tested prior to the implementation of the CCM intervention. After four weeks, all four groups were post-tested using the students motivation questionnaire (SMQ). Data were analysed using the t-test, ANOVA and ANCOVA. The results show that students exposed to the CCM approach have significantly higher motivation than those taught through regular methods. The results further indicate that there is no statistically significant gender difference in motivation towards the learning of biology among secondary school students exposed to CCM. The researchers conclude that CCM is an effective teaching approach, which biology teachers need to incorporate in their teaching. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2007.

AB  - For a modern e-Learning platform, it has to confront with an important issue that is how to provide meaningful learning for learners. In this paper, we used the method of concept maps to integrate the four tiers, which are knowledge management, instructional, learning and technological tier, in order to achieve the meaningful learning. The significance of concept maps is not only on the promotion of knowledge concepts and action skills, but also on the affection which can be rendered the right cognition and values for learners. Finally, this research proposed a Knowledge Management Learning System (KMLS), where it can support learning-process progress and facilitate learners' learning more meaningfully. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - In this paper, we discuss the development, implementation, and assessment of a novel integrated curriculum in chemical engineering. This curriculum, based on block scheduling, consists of 6 main or "pillar" courses, augmented by a number of concurrent laboratory classes. The goal of this new curriculum is to foster integrated thinking beginning as early as the sophomore year, while at the same time enabling instructors to have the flexibility to utilize modern pedagogical tools. By using a world-class suite of assessment techniques including concept maps and concept inventories, we hope to produce a truly validated success story that can serve as a model that is applicable for all engineering disciplines.

AB  - In this paper, we examined the effect of knowledge interdependence among co-learners on knowledge convergence outcomes. Prior to collaboration, two partners read the same text in the independent condition while each of them read one of two complementary texts in the interdependent condition. In the remote collaboration phase, partners were asked to build a collaborative concept map. While interacting, they were provided with visualizations (concept maps) of both their own- and their partner's knowledge. No effect of interdependence could be found with respect to both outcome knowledge equivalence and shared outcome knowledge. In the independence condition, convergence was mainly due to the fact that partners received the same text before collaboration. In the interdependence condition, shared knowledge did not occur as a result of social interaction. It seems that participants were able to individually link what they learnt from text to complementary information provided by their partner's map. © 2008 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - To explore the ways in which teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches influence students' conceptual understanding of seasonal change, we designed a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) course to compare, by means of concept maps, the learning outcome of students in two groups: a teacher-guided (TG) class (with whole-class presentations) and a student-centered (SC) class (with individual online learning). The participants were two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this technologically enhanced environment, the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F = 28.05, p ≤ 0.001). The conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change. The student-centered approach allows students to more freely test their own hypotheses in the processes of exploration and modeling, and thus move from assimilatory to properly scientific explanations. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Willow is an automatic and adaptive free-text scoring system. Its main purpose is to provide formative assessment to the students so that they can get more practise and feedback before their exams. It also keeps track of the terms that students use in their answers to automatically generate each particular student conceptual model and the group conceptual model. In both cases, the conceptual model can be defined as a set of concepts and their relationships that each student keeps in his or her mind about an area of knowledge. The conceptual model can be represented by COMOV as a concept map so that instructors can track students’ concepts acquisition. In this paper, we present the new possibility and its consequences of showing the concept maps (from their individual and group conceptual models) not only to instructors but also to students. Moreover, to allow students to see their evolution, as they study and get more training, through their concept maps. The preliminary results of an experiment carried out with a group of students show how they like to be able to inspect their generated learning models. © 2007 The authors and IOS Press.

AB  - Pupils with autism often present significant challenges to teachers. They seem to have real strengths in visual processing but a cognitive style that encourages them to focus on detail rather than the overarching connections between concepts. Veronica Roberts, currently undertaking doctoral training at the Institute of Education, University of London, in order to become an educational psychologist, and Richard Joiner, senior lecturer in the Department of Psychology at the University of Bath, set out to explore these issues. In this article, they report the outcomes of a naturalistic experiment in which they investigated the utility of concept mapping as an educational strategy with pupils diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD). Theoretical arguments supporting the use of concept mapping with an autistic population are outlined in the paper. A tutor group of ten pupils with ASD, aged between 11 and 14 years, took part in the study. Concept mapping tasks were integrated within National Curriculum science lessons in collaboration with the school's science teacher. The study found that the increase in pupil performance in subject-specific questionnaires was nearly four times greater in the concept mapping condition than after a more conventional teaching intervention. Veronica Roberts and Richard Joiner tentatively draw out the implications of their work for staff who work with pupils with ASD and make recommendations for further research into the use of these learning strategies. © 2007 Nasen.

AB  - Curriculum design is a concern in European Universities as they face the forthcoming European Higher Education Area (EHEA). This process can be eased by the use of scientific tools such as Concept-Mapping Techniques (CMT) that extract and organize the most relevant information from experts' experience using statistics techniques, and helps a working group to achieve conclusions. This paper presents an empirical exploratory research study related to the application of the CMT to the design of the Electronic Engineering (EE) Degree at the University of Seville, Spain. Considering the Career-space conclusions as the initial point, the main relevant competences were identified in a brainstorming technique. These competences are organized according to their affinity using CMT, establishing and interpreting the main clusters and their relative importance. Finally, a reliability analysis of the concept maps was carried out verifying the correctness of the procedure and validating the results for the curricula adaptation. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The aim of this study was to identify problems arisen by conventional curricula, the guidelines for development of an appropriate educational model for 21st century, and the advantages and disadvantages of the last two curricular models. The medical education literature published from 1995 through 2002 of four reputable journals in medical education were searched (Academic Medicine, Teaching and Learning in Medicine, Medical Education, and Medical Teacher). First the possibly best articles were identified. During the second screening process 76 of 180 articles were found to be highly relevant to our questions. A review of the chosen articles revealed a concept map which starts from currently applied hypothetical-deductive reasoning (HDR)-based curricula in many medical schools all around the world. Results revelaed that continuing cyclical process might be time consuming, enhance burden of faculty and might be stressful for students involved. Current issues in health care system are possibly attributable to current HDR-based curricular models including PBL. Advantages of reiterative PBL theory can not be denied, but it appears that its limited application should be mainly seen in some academic classes to develop some generic transferable skills simultaneously with other teaching methods. Therefore vast application of HDR in clinical settings is not recommended according to our study. However the relationships demonstrated between factors and outcomes mentioned in the concept map can be used to run some new studies to test some hypotheses. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This study explores students understanding of key concepts in nanoscience with the intention of identifying a potential threshold concept in the field through the analysis of student concept maps and explanatory interviews. The analysis of students' maps indicates conceptual development and learning difficulties in learning size-dependent property change at the Nano-scale. In addition, it identifies potential threshold concepts in the study and understanding of nanoscale science from the students' perspective. It also indicates the importance of previous learning in science to integrate isolated concepts and to help students achieve a deeper understanding of key phenomena at the nanoscale.

AB  - In the present study, participants working in dyads were asked to build a concept map collaboratively. While interacting, they were able to access visualizations (individual concept maps) of both their own and their partner's prior knowledge (own and peer maps). Eye movements of both learning partners were recorded during the course of collaboration. Our goal was twofold. First, we focused on transactivity at both the visual and action levels. Second, we investigated the effects of knowledge interdependence with the partner on transactivity in collaborative concept mapping. We found that the degree to which participants co-manipulate the same objects in the collaborative map (action transactivity) is higher when they discussed identical (rather than complementary) information. Results from eye-gaze data showed that participants who shared complementary information transitioned more frequently between their own map and their partner's map; eye-movement transitions between own and peer maps were also negatively correlated with learning outcomes.

AB  - Engaging end-users effectively in the construction process is becoming increasingly important in the UK. However, this engagement is often hindered by the amount and complexity of information and knowledge that needs to be communicated among project stakeholders. This can often create a ‘mismatch’ between stakeholders’ expectations and the physical building constructed. A survey was carried out in two secondary schools in the North West of the UK to determine whether a ‘mismatch’ existed. An nD-based computer game was suggested to address this mismatch, the rubrics of which aimed to facilitate the early engagement of endusers in the construction process by providing ‘what-if’ analysis through visually shareable information. This approach was regarded as a self-learning tool, through which end-users could learn about the complexity of the construction process and the decisions and trade-offs being made. This research targeted school children (aged 11–16) as the end-users, under the Building Schools for the Future initiative funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. In order to simplify the information communicated to school children, a concept map was developed to identify the interrelationship between the nD concept, the gaming technology concept and the school building design concept. These interrelationships were used to inform the secondary phase of this research (unreported) which will be the actual development of the computer game. © 2007 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Concept mapping is a teaching and learning tool that is especially suited for science-based instruction. This article describes concept mapping as a tool for course evaluation in a fourth-year undergraduate Wellness course in a Health Studies Department. Pre-lecture and post-lecture concept maps describing wellness were compared on the basis of the degree of complexity of the diagram and the relationships among the various parameters. The post-lecture maps showed significantly more detail than did the pre-lecture maps, and the complexity of the post-lecture maps provided evidence that the students had a clearer understanding of all wellness parameters. Compared with a traditional course survey, this method detailed what information was important to students in their understanding of the course material and provided meaningful feedback on material that required greater emphasis in the course. Further research into the use of concept mapping to refine evaluative criteria and provide effective teaching is recommended.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of concept mapping over traditional instruction on students' understanding and retention of heat and temperature concepts. The sample of this study consisted of 5th grade students from two classes of a elementary school (n=75). One intact class was randomly assigned to the comparison group whereas the other one was randomly assigned to the experimental group. During teaching the topic of heat and temperature concepts in earth science curriculum, the experimental group was taught with the concept mapping instruction while the comparison group was taught with the traditional instruction. The results revealed that the students in the experimental group performed better on heat and temperature concepts. However, it has been found that there was no significant difference between experimental and control group on students' retention scores of heat and temperature concept test.

AB  - Concept mapping has been traditionally used as a tool for active learning, student's learning assessment and evaluation. In an attempt to achieve student learning, curricula development and assessment have taken new and diverse approaches. Concept mapping is one novel way for curricula development and validation of program outcomes and their linkages with required skills and competencies' levels. Mechanical, Chemical, and Computer Engineering have used concept maps across a wide range of educational applications: from simply creating a conceptual overview of course objectives for students to using them for curricula evaluation and improvement. This paper reports on the use of concept maps for both extremes. The paper presents a review of concept mapping applications in engineering disciplines in general and in Electrical and Computer Engineering in specific. The generic concept map framework is presented and its expansion into the specific mapping for the authors' affiliated University's baccalaureate engineering degrees is presented. The validation process of the curriculum map is discussed. The impact of the conceptual presentation of the curriculum to freshman and sophomore students is measured through surveys and the data is discussed. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, die authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing die inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed die concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between die concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe die relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. Copyright © 2008 Heldref Publications.

AB  - In this study, mathematics, physics and chemistry teachers' approaches and their knowledge about assessment tools and their assessment practices are explored. The instrument developed by researchers was given to 121 teachers. Data analysis revealed that teachers' knowledge about achievement tests and questioning was high, whereas their knowledge of alternative assessment tools such as portfolios, concept maps, journals and experiment reports was low. It was identified that these four alternative assessment tools were ranked lowest in terms of frequency of usage, importance attached and reliance upon. In addition, it was observed that there is a variation on teachers' approaches to these tools. The two most valued and important tools were found to be participation and effort. The use of assessment practices didn't differ with respect to gender and experience, however physics and mathematics teachers' use of traditional tools was observed to be significantly different.

AB  - This study aims at highlighting the collaborative activity of two high school students (age 14) in the cases of modeling the complex biological process of plant growth with two different tools: the 'paper & pencil' concept mapping technique and the computer-supported educational environment 'ModelsCreator'. Students' shared activity in both cases is carried out in the presence of a facilitator providing technical as well as cognitive support when necessary. The objective of the study is to highlight the ways in which the collaborating students are engaged in the plant growth modeling activity in the two cases and also identify the activity's similar and different aspects in each one. Our analysis is carried out on two complementary axes, the first of which concerns the process of collaboratively creating a plant growth model with each different tool, while the second has to do with the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in each case. A two-level analytic tool for the modeling process has been derived within the theoretical framework of 'activity theory' on the basis of the OCAF scheme for basic modeling operations and the scheme of Stratford et al. [Stratford, S. J., Krajcik, J., & Soloway, E. (1998). Secondary students' dynamic modeling processes: analyzing, reasoning about, synthesizing, and testing models of stream ecosystems. Journal of Science Education and Technology, 7(3), 215-234.] for higher-order modeling actions. According to our results, four major modeling actions (analysis, synthesis, testing-interpreting, technical and cognitive support) performed through a plethora of modeling operations define the steps of the modeling process in both cases, while specific qualitative differences can be actually identified. Finally, the students' conceptualizations of the biological aspect of the modeling task in the two-case activity is analyzed in regard with their capability of shifting reasoning between macro- and micro-levels, while educational implications are also discussed. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who independently used their study time. The findings revealed that individually generating concept maps on computers during study time positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept maps on computers for learning. © International Forum of Educational Technology & Society (IFETS).

AB  - In order to obtain semantic interoperability in open systems, the systems involved need to agree on commonly understandable knowledge representations. The case considered in this paper is one of a system needing to communicate and share knowledge using concept maps and ontologies, in the context of the environmental sciences and the semantic Web. We present how to formally obtain ontologies codified in the OWL language from concept maps. Concept maps are a flexible and informal form of knowledge representation, while OWL is a language oriented to processing carried out by machines. The mapping between concept maps and ontologies is a formal transformation, which semantically analyzes the relations linking the concepts in the map. The proposed method includes a concept-sense disambiguation procedure and uses the WordNet lexical knowledge base. It also includes automatic learning of the semantics of the relations between concepts. The proposed method has been applied to the environmental-knowledge domain, through tests of several concept maps with labels in Spanish.

AB  - Relations between preservice teachers' guided field observations of primary literacy instruction and knowledge about effective beginning reading practices were explored. Preservice teachers (n = 48) participated in a Directed Field Experience course including instruction on and observations of exemplary teaching practices promoting student engagement and literacy achievement. Correlations, calculated between the quantity of exemplary reading instruction practices observed by preservice teachers and the accuracy of observations with their knowledge about effective beginning literacy instruction, suggest guided field observations of exemplary practices may positively impact preservice teachers' knowledge of effective early literacy instruction. Observing more exemplary practices was associated with preservice teachers' knowledge acquisition represented in concept maps (r =.368; p =.015). Practices promoting a generally motivating classroom atmosphere were more readily understood by preservice teachers than intricate subtleties of motivating literacy instruction.

AB  - This article considers the impact of the early stages of an international project, Gardens for Life (GfL), on children's perceptions of school gardening and on their learning. The project involved 67 schools in England, Kenya and India and focused on the growing of crops, recognising the importance of both the process and product of this activity in the different countries. The theoretical framework was derived from consideration of informal learning, and more specifically experiential learning, drawing on prior research undertaken in the context of school gardening. The research approach is characterised by the use of concept maps to uncover the characteristically different ways in which children discerned school gardening and to help to provide insight into their understanding of this activity. It was supported by contextual observation, interviews and children's drawings to aid the interpretation and understanding. The study showed a positive impact on learning and on the perceptions of children towards school gardening in all three countries. It also highlighted the different perceptions, interpretations and understanding of school gardening in the different cultures and environments, as well as the various aspects of it which the children themselves highlighted. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - The development of teaching in higher education towards a more learner‐orientated model has been supported by the literature on individual learning differences and on learning styles in particular. This has contributed to the evolution of university pedagogy away from a medieval transmission model than runs counter to contemporary understanding of learning. However, rather than solving problems of classroom practice, recognition of student learning differences has amplified a number of tensions within the system that have not been adequately resolved in practical terms for academic staff. Such tensions complicate the professional lives of university teachers and as a consequence may lead to cycles of non‐learning as teachers retreat towards the familiar transmission of content. A reconceptualisation of university pedagogy towards an expertise model allows the variation between complementary chains of practice and networks of understanding to be exploited as a positive characteristic of the learning experience. © 2008 UCU.

AB  - CIRCSIM-Tutor, an intelligent tutoring system in the domain of cardiovascular physiology, teaches students to solve problems according to a concept map taught in class. Although students believe that the concept map provides a unique solution to each problem, the solution is in fact dependent on a set of implicit assumptions that determine a unique reading of the concept map. In this paper we analyze the ambiguities in the CIRCSIM-Tutor concept map, then derive a set of rules that can be used to produce the unique correct reading for this map. We have implemented these rules in CAPE, a reimplementation of CIRCSIM-Tutor based on a fully declarative representation.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to use concept maps as an 'expressed model' to investigate students' mental models regarding the homeostasis of blood sugar. The difficulties in learning the concept of homeostasis and in probing mental models have been revealed in many studies. Homeostasis of blood sugar is one of the themes in junior high school biology in Taiwan. However, few studies have investigated it. Here, semi-structured interviews were conducted together with concept mapping to explore students' mental models. There were 14 students, 7th- and 9th-graders, in this study. From the results, both groups were shown to lack a concept of the nervous system. However, 7th-graders did have more developed concepts of the endocrine and digestive systems. The data also indicated that students used external behaviours or life experiences to explain the mechanism responsible for the homeostasis of blood sugar, but did not possess a detailed view of the components of the mechanism. The implications, and recommendations for pedagogy, are discussed.

AB  - We investigated whether and how prior knowledge activation improves learning outcomes for high school (less experienced learners) and university students (experienced learners) in a hypertext environment. Map coherence was defined as the extent to which relationships between the concepts in the map were made explicit. Therefore, we classified the mapping task of creating and labelling lines as low-coherent, and the mapping task of labelling provided lines as high-coherent. Learners were randomly assigned to the conditions of (1) high-coherent knowledge activation; (2) low-coherent knowledge activation; and (3) a baseline condition without prior knowledge activation. We found an overall effect for prior knowledge activation, learning experience, and an interaction between learning experience and the coherence of the prior knowledge activation task on learning outcomes. High school students benefited most from labelling provided lines, while university physics majors benefited most from creating and labelling lines. This interaction effect and effects of the specific mapping tasks on process measures support the claim that different prior knowledge activation tasks are suited for different groups of learners. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of relationships among concepts. Willis and Miertschin suggested the use of technology-based concept mapping as an active learning strategy that can enhance learning and thinking skills, particularly among students native to a digital environment [16]. In addition, modern concept mapping software tools enable instructors and students to create visual navigation structures through complex knowledge domains. The authors find value in visual navigation structures for their relevance to organizing and simplifying learning environments and for their appeal to visual learners. This paper investigates different ways to develop digital interactive concept maps (CMaps) to help students navigate complex knowledge domains, such as the content of a course or a curriculum. CMaps can be used to present information in a nonsequential way or in several different ways, depending on the need. Interactivity enables students to easily locate digital information artifacts pertinent to a concept (media files, slide presentations, web pages, etc.) by clicking on links associated with a CMap node representing the course concept or category. A review of recent literature is provided, different software tools are compared, and the authors document their personal experience.

AB  - An electronic portfolio system, designed to serve as a resource-based learning space, was tested in a fifth-grade science class. The control-group students accessed a traditional folder-based information display in the system and the experimental-group students accessed a concept map-based information display to review a science portfolio. The student-constructed science portfolio was a result of a collection of digital artefacts such as graphic images, instructional videos and textual files on terms and definitions relevant to the Earth's atmosphere. In the information-processing performance test, the experimental-group students scored significantly higher and spent much less time in finding answers to the questions presented. Also, in the 3-day delayed memory retention tests, the experimental-group students achieved significantly higher scores. The multiple regression models confirm that the visualisation variation is the most significant predictor for student performance (ie, comprehension and access time). Also, the regression models suggest that language-arts proficiency may reduce overall system access time; while higher math proficiency may predict retention scores. © 2007 British Educational Communications and Technology Agency.

AB  - This paper reports the use of quantitative and qualitative measures of university student learning during teaching in psychiatry. Concept mapping, pre-and post test scores and performance in written assignments were used to measure the quality of change in personal understanding and to show the ways that the knowledge-targets of the course were achieved. The data show that: (1) Concept mapping can be used to explore personal understanding because it facilitates discrete statements of meaning. (2) These personal statements can be compared through time to assess change. (3) Specific criteria can be used to measure the quality of the change from one statement to another so that the different qualities of change that occur can be made-visible in the course of teaching. The approach is discussed in the broader context of learning theory and teaching practice. We show in particular, that prior-knowledge is an important determinant of learning because it affects the sense that can be made of taught material. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.

AB  - Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions thai economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their science classes. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - This paper shows how concept mapping can be used to measure the quality of e-learning. Six volunteers (all of them 3rd-year medical students) took part in a programme of e-learning designed to teach the principles of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Their understanding of MRI was measured before and after the course by the use of concept mapping. The quality of change in individuals' maps was assessed using criteria developed to distinguish between meaningful and rote-learning outcomes. Student maps were also scored for evidence of conceptual richness and understanding. Finally, each map was compared directly with the content of the electronic teaching material. The results show that many of the student misconceptions were put right in the course of their learning but that many of the key concepts introduced in the teaching were ignored (or sometimes learnt by rote) by the students. This was because the teaching material locked these new ideas in structures and terminology that precluded meaning-making among non-experts. Our data suggest that students' prior knowledge is a key determinant of meaningful learning. We suggest that this must be acknowledged if the design and use of electronic teaching material is also to be meaningful. Ultimately, measures of student learning are the only authentic indicators of the quality of teaching through technology. © 2008 Becta.

AB  - HIV/AIDS poses grave risk to human development in sub-Saharan Africa. Evidence-based interventions that are rooted in local culture could help efforts to prevent threats to human development from HIV/AIDS. We used concept mapping (Concept System, 2006) to construct the components and content of a locally developed HIV/AIDS curriculum for use by secondary schools in Lusaka, Zambia. Participants were school counsellors (n=14), youth health program officers (n=7), and regular education teachers (n=3) from the education, health, and youth development agencies in Lusaka, Zambia (males=11; females=13; mean age 38; SD=15 years). Concept mapping yielded six statement clusters defining preliminary components of a locally grounded in-school HIV/AIDS prevention curriculum and the content items that define these components: (1) life skills education (18 items), (2) sexuality and reproductive health (10 items), (3) treatment, care and support (13 items), (4) counselling (12 items), (5) basic facts about HIV/AIDS (11 items), and (6) dissemination of information about HIV/AIDS (11 items). Zambian locally constructed constructs for an HIV/STD prevention curriculum overlap those promoted by public health programs in the country and internationally. © 2008 International Union of Psychological Science.

AB  - Background: Concept maps developed as teaching tools by Novak et al. depending on Ausubel's cognitive learning theory display the relationships and hierarchy between the concepts. Concept maps, having been used mostly as teaching tools, display the relationships between the concepts concretely and therefore are qualified to be utilized as an alternative evaluation tool in terms of research on students' cognitive structures. Purpose: This study aims to determine the cognitive structures of secondary level students regarding electric current through the concept mapping technique. Programme description: First, an activity was conducted with the students, which aimed to inform the students about concept mapping during a lesson hour. Then, students were given 26 concepts related to electric current and were asked to create their concept maps. The conceptual structures of students were determined through the examination of their concept maps via the descriptive statistical methods. Sample: The research was conducted with a total of 244 (119 female - 125 male) students aged between 15 and 17, who attend Year 12 in eight different secondary schools in Ankara within the 2003-2004 academic year. Design and methods: This research is a qualitative study that uses concept mapping technique to determine the students' conceptions of secondary level students related to electric current. The conceptual structures of students were determined through the examination of their concept maps via the descriptive statistical methods. As the data collection tool, the concept maps created by the students as well as the semi-structured and structured interviews with 20% of each class were utilized. Moreover, all students interviewed also experienced a structured interview where two simple electric circuits consisting of a battery, resistance and electric bulb were discussed. The obtained responses were analyzed under separate categories. Results: The research concluded that students had various alternative conceptions regarding electric current. Some of these alternative conceptions held by the students were found to be different from the ones in the literature. "Electric current is stored in the generator.", "Electric current moves in the opposite direction of (-) load" and "Electric current is spent at the resistances" represent some of the misconceptions of the students. Conclusions; With the help of the concept maps, the alternative concepts in the conceptual structures of the students could also be determined. As in this study, concept maps provide the determination of alternative conceptions that were already thought to be held by the students, as well as different alternative conceptions.

AB  - This paper presents a group of elements to improve teaching and learning in technological education. These elements are based on some contributions issued from contemporary educational models, namely, the thematic approach, meaningful learning, concept maps, and the spiral curriculum. Based on a thematic approach, a new way is proposed to select the contents that will be explored in the educational process. We emphasize the benefits of a thematic approach in students' motivation. After contents are chosen, we propose the use of the directives of meaningful learning and concept maps, as a method and as a tool, respectively, to organize knowledge hierarchically, from general and inclusive concepts to specific ones. This may facilitate learning and understanding of the great bulk of knowledge to be dealt with during technological courses. A proposal has been submitted for a teaching module in computer networks and also for a complete course plan. The spiral curriculum was applied during the development of learning in the classroom, where some fundamental concepts were introduced many times over, adding more details gradually. A qualitative analysis of the application of these educational proposals, including learning evaluation aspects, is also presented. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - Objective: Tailored nutrition Web programs constitute an emerging trend in obesity prevention. Initial investment in innovative technology necessitates that the target population be well understood. This pilot study's purpose was to determine the feasibility of a workplace nutrition Web program. Design: Formative research was conducted with gaming industry employees and benefits managers to develop a consensus on workplace-specific nutrition needs. A demonstration Web program was piloted with stakeholders to determine feasibility. Setting: Indiana, Mississippi, Nevada, and New Jersey gaming establishments. Participants: 86 employees, 18 benefits managers. Intervention: Prototype Web program. Main Outcome Measures: Concept mapping; 16-item nutrition knowledge test; satisfaction. Analysis: Concept mapping was used to aggregate importance ratings on programmatic content, which informed Web program curriculum. Chi-square tests were performed postintervention to determine knowledge improvement. Results: (1) Employees and benefits managers exhibited moderate agreement about content priorities for the program (r = 0.48). (2) There was a significant increase in employees' nutrition knowledge scores postintervention (t = 7.16, df = 36, P < .001); those with less knowledge exhibited the greatest gains in knowledge scores (r = -0.647, P < .001). Conclusions and Implications: Employees and benefit managers do not necessarily agree on the priority of nutrition-related content, suggesting a need for programs to appeal to various stakeholders. Computer-based approaches can address various stakeholder health concerns via tailored, customized programming. © 2008 SOCIETY FOR NUTRITION EDUCATION.

AB  - The purpose of this 4-year research study was to develop paper-and-pencil tests that could be administered to a wide range of students in order to establish a database about students' physics conceptions from elementary school to high school levels in Taiwan. The students' misconceptions of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, heat, sound and wave, and optics were diagnosed. In the beginning of this study, we extensively reviewed the research literature on related conceptions. With the use of concept maps and related propositional statements, we also interviewed some students to find out their conceptual understanding of the selected key concepts. These data provided sufficient information about students' thoughts of several concepts. Through a process of developing two-tier test items, nine versions of physics questionnaires were obtained. More than 13,000 students were randomly sampled in a national survey. After data analysis, the results indicated that students' misconceptions in physics such as the image formed by lenses and mirrors and the torque and rotational motion were consistent with their ages. However, in some cases, such as the current in an electric circuit, students' understandings of concepts did not improve with age.

AB  - Information technology students at universities have in general found difficulty in grasping object-oriented (OO) concepts. They have problems with abstract thinking, especially in the context of performing abstractions of real-world problems in object-oriented analysis and design (OOAD) courses. Most of these students prefer to focus on the implementation phase of a software development lifecycle and consider the preceding analysis and design phases unnecessary. We present an approach to introduce the concept map as the first domain model to be derived from functional requirements or textual use cases during the analysis phase. It can subsequently evolve into a class diagram containing information on classes, attributes, associations, generalization-specialization hierarchies, aggregation and methods. This paper contains results of a quantitative evaluation for gauging the effectiveness of concept mapping in helping students with their abstraction techniques.

AB  - Concept maps have become a ubiquitous tool in education in the last 20 years and are used extensively to teach scientific concepts. A concept map is a tool learners can use to organize information about a topic in terms of key concepts and the relationships among them. As a graphical representation, the map provides an overall picture of a particular concept or topic. This article describes how we have used concept maps to teach physiology to veterinary medical and veterinary technician students enrolled in our on-campus and distance-learning programs. © 2007 AAVMC.

The participants were trained to use structure maps while solving problems sharing similar deep-structure elements. They met for one hour every week to work on the problems using the maps. We report here on the ways in which students used the structure maps during the interviews, the difficulties faced by students as they attempted to use these maps as well as the feedback offered by students regarding the maps. We also report on how we changed the maps based on feedback from the students and to facilitate their use during problem solving. © 2008 American Institute of Physics.

AB  - Commercial computer games contain "physics engine" components, responsible for providing realistic interactions among game objects. The question naturally arises of whether these engines can be used to develop educational materials for high school and university physics education. To answer this question, the author's group recently conducted a detailed scientific investigation of the physics engine of Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004). This article presents their motivation, methodology, and results. The author presents the findings of experiments that probed the accessibility and fidelity of UT2004's physics engine, examples of educational materials developed, and an evaluation of their use in high school classes. The associated pedagogical implications of this approach are discussed, and the author suggests guidelines for educators on how to deploy the approach. Key resources are presented on an associated Web site. © 2008 SAGE Publications.

AB  - The use of pedagogical methods with the technologies of the information and communications produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. Such is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which constitute a tool for the management of knowledge, an aid to personalize the learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Effective knowledge management maintains the knowledge assets of an organization by identifying and capturing useful information in a usable form, and by supporting refinement and reuse of that information in service of the organization's goals. Concept Mapping provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. However, it does not address how relevant Concept Maps can be retrieved or adapted to new problems. Case-Based Reasoning is playing an increasing role in knowledge retrieval and reuse for corporate memories, and its capabilities are appealing to augment the concept mapping process. In this paper the authors present a new approach to elaborate Intelligent Teaching-Learning Systems, where the techniques of concepts diagrams and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using the Case-Based Reasoning as theoretical framework for the Student Model. The proposed model has been implemented in the computational system HESEI, which has been successfully applied in the teaching-learning process by laymen in the Computer Science field. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - The long-term goal of Project Halo is to build an application called Digital Aristotle that can answer questions on a wide variety of science topics and provide user- and domain-appropriate explanations. As a near-term goal, we are focusing on enabling subject matter experts (SMEs) to construct declarative knowledge bases (KBs) from 50 pages of a science textbook in the domains of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology in a way that the system can answer questions similar to those in an Advanced Placement (AP) exam in the respective discipline. The textbook knowledge is a mixture of textual information, mathematical equations, tables, diagrams, and domain-specific representations such as chemical reactions. In this paper, we explore the following question: Can we build a knowledge capture system to enable SMEs to construct KBs from the knowledge found in science textbooks and use the resulting KB for deductive question answering? We answer this question in the context of a system called AURA that supports knowledge capture from science textbooks. Copyright 2007 ACM.

AB  - Although collaborative group work is used by many instructors as a useful educational tool, there is much room for research on how learning actually occurs within collaborative learning environments. This paper attempts to explore the relationship(if any) between task structure and collaborative group interactions in a synchronous peer interaction collaborative learning environment. For this reason, we used the Cmap during a Physics course for Grade 12 students. This paper compares two groups of students, one studying concept maps with single answer task, and the other studying concept maps with variable answer task. The aim of the study presented in this article is to also investigate the influence of task structure on students' interactivity according to certain indicators and cognitive performance. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - This study was designed to theoretically articulate and empirically assess the role of computer scaffolds. In this project, several examples of educational software were developed to scaffold the learning of students performing high level cognitive activities. The software used in this study, Artemis, focused on scaffolding the learning of students as they performed information seeking activities. As 5th grade students traveled through a project-based science unit on photosynthesis, researchers used a pre-post design to test for both student motivation and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. To measure both variables, a motivation survey and three methods of concept map analysis were used. The student use of the scaffolding features was determined using a database that tracked students' movement between scaffolding tools. The gain scores of each dependent variable was then correlated to the students' feature use (time and hits) embedded in the Artemis Interface. This provided the researchers with significant relationships between the scaffolding features represented in the software and student motivation and conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. There were a total of three significant correlations in comparing the scaffolding use by hits (clicked on) with the dependent variables and only one significant correlation when comparing the scaffold use in time. The first significant correlation (r = .499, p < .05) was between the saving/viewing features hits and the students' task value. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the saving/viewing features and the students' perception of how interesting, how important, and how useful the task is. The second significant correlation (r = 0.553, p < 0.01) was between the searching features hits and the students' self-efficacy for learning and performance. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the searching features and the students' perception of their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task. The third significant correlation (r = 0.519, p < 0.05) was between the collaborative features hits and the students' essay performance scores. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the collaborative features and the students' ability to perform high cognitive tasks. Finally, the last significant correlation (r = 0.576, p < 0.01) was between the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the maintenance features and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine whether or not the construction of concept maps by students improves their achievement and ability to solve higher order questions in chemistry, (2) investigate the differential effect of the treatment by gender and achievement level, and (3) explore the relationships between performance on concept maps and chemistry achievement. Participants were 60 tenth-grade students randomly divided into two groups. The study spanned six weeks in a class that met five times a week. The material covered was acid-base titration and equilibrium in weak acids. The students were pre- and post-tested using a teacher-constructed chemistry test. Results showed that while there were no significant differences on the achievement total score, there were significant differences favoring the experimental group for scores on the knowledge level questions. Moreover, there were sex-achievement interactions at the knowledge and comprehension level questions favoring females and achievement level - achievement interactions favoring low achievers. Finally, there were significant correlations between students' scores on high level questions and the convergence and total concept map scores. Copyright © 2008 by EURASIA.

AB  - The use of present pedagogical methods with Information and Communication Technologies produce a new quality that favors the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. That is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which are considered a learning technique as a way to increase meaningful learning in the sciences. It is also used for the knowledge management as an aid to personalize the Teaching-Learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. Concept Maps provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. In this paper the authors present two different approaches to elaborate Intelligent Teaching-Learning Systems, in each approach Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using in the first one the Case-Based Reasoning and in the other Bayesian Networks as a knowledge representation forms and inference mechanisms for the decision making, supporting the Student Model. The authors also show the facilities and the difficulties they had using each Artificial Intelligence technique combined with Concept Maps. The proposed models have been implemented in the computational systems HESEI and MacBay, whose have been successfully used in the Teaching-Learning process by laymen in the Computer Science field to generate them owns adaptive systems. © 2008 IEEE.

AB  - Middle and high-school science teachers have traditionally introduced current events in the classroom to leverage news topics relevant to the curriculum, such as the Sumatra Tsunami or Hurricane Katrina. SciNews Online is an online research environment co-designed with science teachers for learners to construct web reports on the science behind the news on natural disasters. Writing scientific explanations provides valuable learning opportunities for learners to engage in a realistic and educationally relevant science task. Here I highlight the design of the Scientific Explanation Activity, a scaffolded environment that supports learners. construction of scientific explanations using multiple online sources. The Scientific Explanation Activity focuses on supporting the development of key information literacy skills for sense-making in science inquiry, namely information integration across sources and effective scientific argumentation.

Concept Mapping provides a framework for making this internal knowledge explicit in a visual form that can easily be examined and shared. Concept Maps are relevant since they can be retrieved or adapted to new problems. In the other hand, Case-Based Reasoning as a technique in Artificial Intelligence plays an important role in knowledge retrieval and reuse of memories. In this paper the authors present a new approach to elaborate Intelligent Teaching/Learning Systems, where the techniques of Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using the Case-Based Reasoning as theoretical framework for the Student Model. The proposed model has been implemented in the computational system HESEI, which has been successfully used in the teaching/learning process by laymen in the Computer Science field.

AB  - In information systems that support knowledge-discovery applications such as scientific exploration, reliance on highly structured ontologies as data-organization aids can be limiting. With current computational aids to science work, the human knowledge that creates meaning out of analyses is often only recorded when work reaches publication-or worse, left unrecorded altogether-for lack of an ontological model for scientific concepts that can capture knowledge as it is created and used. We argue for an approach to representing scientific concepts that reflects (1) the situated processes of science work, (2) the social construction of knowledge, and (3) the emergence and evolution of understanding over time. In this model, knowledge is the result of collaboration, negotiation, and manipulation by teams of researchers. Capturing the situations in which knowledge is created and used helps these collaborators discover areas of agreement and discord, while allowing individual inquirers to maintain different perspectives on the same information. The capture of provenance information allows historical trails of reasoning to be reconstructed, allowing end users to evaluate the utility and trustworthiness of knowledge representations. We present a proof-of-concept system, called Codex, based on this situated knowledge model. Codex supports visualization of knowledge structures through concept mapping, and enables inference across those structures. The proof-of-concept is deployed in the domain of geoscience to support distributed teams of learners and researchers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Across North America and in other parts of the world, there has been a growing Recognition that a large gap exists between public health knowledge generated through scientific discovery and its application in individual, community, organizational, and policy innovation. An academic-funder partnership sought to identify potential actions to improve the translation of public health Research to practice in Missouri. Concept mapping, a structured conceptualization process, was used to develop information to support a local action planning effort to improve Research translation to practice in Missouri. Nine conceptual clusters emerged: (1) provide education and training; (2) enhance capacity; (3) change incentives and accountability; (4) shift funding toward community needs; (5) support practice-based Research; (6) engage and collaborate with the community; (7) share knowledge; (8) engage influentials; and (9) sustain momentum; action plans were drafted to address priorities in each cluster. The project connected the ideas of a wide-ranging set of stakeholders, identified areas of high-level agreement among stakeholders, and supported shared agenda setting. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.

AB  - Bacterial conjugation is a genetic transfer that involves cell-to-cell between donor and recipient cells. With the current method used to teach students in genetic courses at the undergraduate level, the transconjugants are identified using bacterial physiology and/or antibiotic resistance. Using physiology, however, is difficult for both first-year undergraduates and special science students at the high school levels, who do not have the basic knowledge. We have developed a laboratory exercise that comprises a simple and rapid technique for transferring bacterial DNA by conjugation and examining the transconjuants using only antibiotic resistance on agar. The identity of the right transconjuants is confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis. This exercise is designed to help students understand how horizontal gene transfer occurs in bacteria by conjugation using Escherichia coli as a hands-on learning model. Students should be able to draw concept maps of three DNA transfer methods on their own after carrying out the experiment and getting some additional information. © 2007 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.

AB  - Nine 11th and 12th grade students from a large urban high school participated in a three-tiered program that charged them with the responsibility to be earth science mentors for 7th graders from a local feeder school. During Tier I, a three-month training period, these 11th and 12th graders worked closely with university-based scientists, science educators, and secondary science teachers to learn a tested curriculum on climate change and to prepare to be mentors. Prior to Tier I, four scientists involved in climate change research were asked to derive independently a list of concepts that they perceived to be most central to this topic. A concept mapping exercise was developed from their consensus and, both at the beginning and at the end of Tier I, student understandings were analyzed with concept maps and interviews. A baseline of 11th and 12th grade students' understandings of climate change is established and suggestions are made as to how these findings can inform instructional practices in the geosciences.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose the use of unified modelling language (UML) based ontologies to develop a faceted model to facilitate semantic browsing and searching in digital libraries. Design/methodology/approach - The approach is to understand the way information gets logically organised in the human mind in terms of mutually defined concepts. Ontologies will be used to model the semantic structure of individual information sources using the faceted classification schema of Dr S.R. Ranganathan, though with improvisation to accommodate new concepts relating to digital resources. Findings - UML can be the best option for knowledge representation if the target system is a digital library where the required type of reasoning about ontologies is more in terms of answering specific and specialised questions. Here, ontologies can be used to facilitate a distributed information retrieval system. Originality/value - The proposed model will not only facilitate semantic searching using UML concept maps but will also enable domain experts, even those with little coding expertise, to build ontologies for their resources while submitting their documents to the digital library. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

AB  - Background: The preparation of patients for bariatric surgery includes education concerning the intervention and its after-effects, and training on the health behaviors that they must put into practice after surgery. In this descriptive study, we have analyzed the cognitive structures of obese patients who have participated in a series of education sessions given by a medical team. Methods: 30 severely obese patients participated in an interview during which a concept map was drawn up. The concept maps were analyzed to describe the nature and organization of the patient's knowledge. Results: 10 knowledge domains have been identified concerning the intervention (principles, risks, follow-up care) and its consequences (weight, health, diet, social and psychological well-being, self-image, physical activity). Height domains were brought up by more than two-thirds of the patients. The knowledge organization is quite variable, as shown by the connections drawn between domains. Knowledge is mingled with other mental states in the cognitive structures of the patients. One-third of them expressed erroneous knowledge, especially concerning the surgical intervention and diet. The patients expressed numerous and positive perspectives on the expected change (81% of the mental states). Most concerned their quality of life. Nonetheless, 17 out of 30 patients also expressed themselves in a more negative fashion (12% of the mental states). Conclusion. This study shows the richness and diversity of the knowledge acquired by patients before a bariatric operation. It confirms the importance of education before surgery and the necessity of pursuing it as part of their long-term care. © 2007 Springer Science + Business Media B.V.

AB  - This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers’ beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many classroom teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers’ thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers’ beliefs, stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool may have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers ‘stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards’ vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could be characterized in three ways; coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs about the connections of concepts within science. 2008 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - Concept maps consist of nodes that represent concepts and links that represent relationships between concepts. Various studies have shown that concept mapping fosters meaningful learning. However, little is known about the specific cognitive processes that are responsible for such mapping effects. In a thinking-aloud study, we analyzed the relations between cognitive processes during concept mapping as well as the characteristics of the concept maps that the learners produced and learning outcomes (38 university students). To test whether differences in learning outcome are due to differences in general abilities, verbal and spatial abilities were also assessed. In a cluster-analysis two types of ineffective learners were identified: 'non-labeling mappers' and 'non-planning mappers'. Effective learners, in contrast, showed much effort in planning their mapping process and constructing a coherent concept map. These strategies were more evident in students with prior concept-mapping experience ('advanced beginners') than in those who had not used this learning strategy before ('successful beginners'). Based on the present findings, suggestions for a direct training approach (i.e., strategy training with worked-out examples) and an indirect training approach (i.e., supporting the learners with strategy prompts) were developed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.

AB  - Throughout their public school education, Japanese students are socialized into cultural learning practices [1] that emphasize group-oriented tasks. Well-organized group work is paramount to successful EFL teaching in Japan. In this paper, we look at how Moodle an open-source learning management system, is used at a Japanese computer science university to organize both individual and group tasks. Examples are provided of freeware and open-source software tools, such as CmapTools for concept mapping and Praat for acoustic analysis that can be used within Moodle to enhance EFL reading, writing, and pronunciation courses. We also explore how Moodle can be integrated with collaborative document production tools, such as Google Docs and Spreadsheets. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Moodle as a tool for action research, enabling the teacher/researcher to tightly control the course content in two different courses while systematically varying aspects of the content to test hypotheses about language learning. An important aspect of our work is the systematization of group process in language and communication courses and the development of a context for experimentation. © 2007 IEEE.

AB  - Concept mapping is a kind of teaching and learning method. In this research, concept mapping was used as an assessment method. Firstly, the physics teacher candidates were asked to draw their own concept maps about impulse and momentum. Afterwards an achievement test about these concepts with 21 questions was administered. Analysis of the drawings revealed that the teacher candidates have problems in applying and understanding the concepts of impulse and momentum. The correlation between scores in concept maps and the achievement test were weak. While the achievement test measures knowledge and using attained knowledge in different situations, the concept maps, on the other hand, measures knowledge from a conceptual point of view.

AB  - The aim of this paper is to show the search for an intelligent system for the teacher support in a meaningful teaching-learning process. As application domain, the authors have chosen the field of Computer memory hierarchy. This field has been chosen due to its limited complexity but it is sufficiently general to be learnt in several disciplines with different levels of detail. Moreover, in previous works the authors have implemented a highly configurable simulator for the teaching of this subject. In a first step, an action research process is carried out, looking for an improvement in the teaching process. As outcome, the design of an expert system is proposed, even independent of the domain field. This expert or intelligent system describes the subject to learn from a variation of conceptual map called Pedagogical Concept Instructional Graph, generated by the teacher. After that, the expert system makes use of an adaptive test, generating several questions that deal with those concepts included in the conceptual map with a hierarchical structure. From each student's answers, it can be obtained a personalized conceptual map describing what the student knows a priori about the subject to learn. © 2007 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

AB  - The use of pedagogical methods with the technologies of the information and communications produces a new quality that favours the task of generating, transmitting and sharing knowledge. Such is the case of the pedagogical effect that produces the use of the Concept Maps, which constitute a tool for the management of knowledge, an aid to personalize the learning process, to exchange knowledge, and to learn how to learn. In this paper the authors present a new approach to elaborate Intelligent Tutoring Systems, where the techniques of Concept Maps and Artificial Intelligence are combined, using Petri Nets as theoretical frame, for the student model. The pedagogical model that controls the interaction between the apprentice and the generated Intelligent Tutoring Systems is implemented by Petri Nets. The Petri Nets transitions are controlled by conditions that refer to the apprentice model. The firing of these transitions produces actions that update this apprentice model. These conditions are automatically included into the pedagogical model and the teacher has only to specify the contents of the domain model. © 2008 Springer Berlin Heidelberg.

AB  - To identify and describe the basis upon which instructors make curricular and pedagogical decisions, we have developed an artifact-based interview and an analysis technique based on multilayered concept maps. The policy capturing technique used in the interview asks instructors to make judgments about concrete instructional arfifacts similar to those they likely encounter in their teaching environment. The analysis procedure alternatively employs both an a priori systems view analysis and an emergent categorization to construct a multilayered concept map, which is a hierarchically arranged set of concept maps where child maps include more details than parent maps. Although our goal was to develop a model of physics faculty beliefs about the teaching and learning of problem solving in the context of an introductory calculus-based physics course, the techniques described here are applicable to a variety of situations in which instructors make decisions that influence teaching and learning. © 2007 The American Physical Society.

AB  - Literature on science conceptions research and field investigations was used to probe alternative conceptions of primary school pupils. Theoretical studies from the literature have shown that there are many emphases on the physical meaning and the effects drawn by philosophers of science leading to the formation of new paradigms concerning science conceptions research. Our focus on primary school pupils' alternative conceptions pertaining to batteries (ACCB), in six phases, was to (1) analyse the context regarding batteries present in primary school; (2) summarize propositional statements and develop a target concept map on batteries; (3) edit protocols for interviews; (4) collect and analyse pupils' ACCB; (5) use the results from phases (1)-(4) to construct a two-tier diagnostic instrument; and (6) submit our instrument with others to carry out tests in a National Science Concept Learning Study (NSCLS). Interview results from 21 primary school pupils show that the characteristics of their ACCB can be categorized into several conceptual models related to language, learning processes, and public media. From the NSCLS, two-tier test data depict the ACCB of the primary school pupils in Taiwan. Many alternative conceptions are significantly related to language and daily life in Taiwan. ACCB in this research can be categorized as either content free or content specific. Conception models based on content free and content specific are presented according to the properties of the ACCB. Our joint venture on concept formation research has been affected by the four temporal paradigms formed at certain prominent historical landmarks in science conceptions research. Our data also show a degree of general similarity with existing literature on science conceptions research.

AB  - This study documents the effects of a scientific fieldwork-based model of instruction on enhancing pedagogical-content knowledge of in-service teachers engaged in an NSF-funded, three-year professional development program for earth/environmental teachers entitled Earth-View (ESI-9911850). We focused on data collected through concept maps and videotaped interviews that dealt specifically with the two areas of participant knowledge germane to enhancing PCK (i.e. content and pedagogical). The videotaped interviews were used to examine how the structure of the program (i.e. specifically, scientific fieldwork) facilitated the development of PCK in the context of instruction designed to increase content and pedagogical knowledge. The concept map evidence supports the assertion that the treatment experienced by Earth-View participants promotes construction of earth/environmental science content knowledge. We also demonstrate the capacity of the program activities (i.e. primarily scientific fieldwork) to promote pedagogical and pedagogical-content knowledge.

AB  - This paper reports on a study of ecology teaching and learning in a Swedish primary school class (age 10-11yrs). A teaching sequence was designed to help students read nature in a river ecosystem. The teaching sequence had a 'bottom up' approach, taking as its starting point a common key organism - the freshwater shrimp. From this species and its ecology, the perspective was broadened to involve studies of the interrelations between organisms and finally to the relationship between biotic and abiotic factors. A large part of the instruction took place outdoors. Students were interviewed three times during the course when they were presented with a tray full of objects (both biotic and abiotic) from the ecosystem. The students' task was to name and describe the objects and then to link them up in as many relevant ways as possible, explaining the reasons for the links. The interviews have been transcribed onto concept maps and SOLO-taxonomy was used to illustrate their developing ecological understanding. Results indicate how students related several abstract processes and correlations back to the key organism studied early in the teaching sequence.

AB  - The paper focuses on the concept, mapping and discussion of loess distribution in Western, Central and Eastern Europe at a scale of 1:2,500,000. The research work is based on studies and data compilation primarily carried out in the 1970s and 1980s [Fink, J., Haase, G., Ruske, R., 1977. Bemerkungen zur Lößkarte von Europe 1:2,5 Mio.

INQUA Newsletter 1983(1), 7-10] and completed recently by additional material and literature references. Reference is also made to recent GIS-based data processing and visualisation techniques that were utilised for the final version of the European Loess Map. The paper provides an overview of the history of the conceptualisation of the map as well as on the loess study in Europe, and than considers the cartographic data on loess sediment formation and distribution in Europe. The classification of loess and loess-like sediments and their distribution throughout Europe as reproduced in the map are discussed [Haase, G., Lieberoth, I., Ruske, R., 1970. Sedimente und Paläoböden im Lössgürtel. In: Richter, H., Haase, G., Lieberoth, I., Ruske, R. (Eds.), Periglazial-Löß-Paläolithikum om JUngpleistozän der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik; Petermanns Geographische Mitteilungen 274, 99-212].

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the organizational structure of educational technology units within U.S. and Canadian medical schools in order to (1) identify organization models that support educational technology, (2) describe key attributes of these models, and (3) discuss the strengths and challenges associated with these models. METHOD: The authors distributed a survey to 88 schools that had previously provided information on their educational technology services and infrastructure. The authors developed the survey through a series of pilots and, then, from the data for each respondent school, created concept maps, which were used to identify organizational models. The authors conducted analyses to determine differences among models. The authors coded the comments about organizational models and identified themes. RESULTS: The authors received adequate data for analysis from 61 schools (69%). Four models for educational technology organizations emerged: (1) centralized units located in the school of medicine, (2) centralized units located at the health science center, (3) centralized units at the comprehensive university, and (4) no centralized unit (Dispersed Model). The majority (75%) of schools relied on some type of centralized organization. Whereas few organization attributes proved to be statistically significant, the centralized models have more resources devoted to educational technology and a closer alignment with the academic mission than the Dispersed Model. CONCLUSIONS: Medical schools primarily use central models. The authors recommend that schools structuring their educational technology resources consider exploration of a central model because of its focused use of resources to improve teaching and learning. © 2008 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - In an empirical study, eye-gaze patterns of pairs of students were recorded and analyzed in a remote situation where they had to build a concept map collaboratively. They were provided (or not), with a knowledge awareness tool that provided learner A with learner B's level of knowledge measured through a pre-test. Previous results showed that the awareness tool positively affected learning gain by enhancing the production of elaborative talk and knowledge negotiation. In the present paper, we describe the actual use of a knowledge awareness tool during the course of interaction by analyzing the gaze paths recorded during the experiment and how they relate to learning performance and verbal interactions. The results showed that learners refer to the knowledge awareness tool episodically during the course of collaboration, mainly to assess the epistemic value of the information provided by the peer, especially when the peer seems uncertain about his understanding. The potential of the synchronized eye-tracking method for research in computer supported collaborative learning is discussed.

AB  - Nurse educators, under pressure to prepare graduates who are able to think critically and solve problems in a variety of clinical practice settings, require active teaching strategies to promote meaningful learning, instead of relying on traditional methods that promote rote memorization. A review of the current state of the science with regard to concept mapping demonstrates that this teaching-learning method assists nurse educators to prepare graduates to think critically in the complex health care environment. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of concept mapping on the graduate's performance on the NCLEX exam and on critical thinking and prioritization skills in the clinical environment.

AB  - Our overall objective is to help students develop the foundational capabilities needed to become successful software developers, that will help them learn how to effectively analyze, design, and implement software systems. The main focus of this paper is the development and use of a concept-based learning tool that helps students acquire effective analysis and design skills for the development of object-oriented programs. Concept maps are tools for organizing and representing knowledge; they enable learners to construct, navigate, share, and criticize knowledge models represented as augmented graphical concept maps. Using the concept map-based tool, students can use concept maps of object-oriented programming to help them solve problems.

AB  - The challenge of developing a better Chemical Engineering Curriculum, or any Engineering curriculum, is to build it such that it prepares students for the engineering economy of today, while enabling them to maintain versatility through life-long learning and continuing education. Toward this end, the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded a number of Coalitions to study "best practices" in Engineering Education. Overwhelmingly, these Coalitions have favored active-learning activities and integration of complementary subjects. With funding from the NSF, we have expanded the recommendations of the Coalitions and developed an integrated Chemical Engineering curriculum that spans the Sophomore to Senior years. To implement the integrated curriculum, we are using block scheduling, a technique with a strong literature base in K-12 education. In a nutshell, through block scheduling multi-semester courses are delivered in a single-semester course. The result has been the Six Pillars of Chemical Engineering. These courses have considerably longer contact hours than a traditional University course so that: (1) students may gain systems insight through integration of their core knowledge across traditional course and discipline boundaries; (2) the instructors have the time to include truly multi-scale (from molecular to continuum to macroscopic) descriptions of Chemical Engineering content; and (3) the instructors have the flexibility to accommodate diverse learning styles and incorporate active learning more effectively. In this paper, we outline the design of our Six Pillars and highlight preliminary results from the pilot of one Pillar: Transport Phenomena. By using a suite of assessment techniques including concept maps, concept inventories, and surveys, we hope to produce a truly validated success story that can serve as a model that is applicable for all engineering disciplines.

AB  - The main goal of this study is to develop a scientific method for designing a teaching methodology used in a basic digital signal processing (DSP) course. The proposed method is based on concept-mapping techniques, which applies multivariate statistic analysis to summarize the experience and knowledge of teachers involved in basic DSP teaching. As a result, a set of teaching methodologies is obtained. This result, as well as other information obtained related to the relative importance of the concepts to be covered, has been used to program the course. Moreover, different teaching tools have been developed to implement the proposed teaching methodology. Finally, the reliability of the method has been compared with similar studies to validate the proposed methodology. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - This study examined the effects of concept mapping on the science achievement of middle grade science students. The subjects were 182 eighth-grade students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes by ability levels. The ability level variable also was examined as a possible effect on student achievement. Two teachers were involved in teaching a unit on weather for nine weeks. An objective weather test and six performance assessment items were used to measure achievement. For this group of students, analyses indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students, as measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that the effect of concept mapping on science achievement is not clear, but that lower ability students appear to have better success with concept mapping than higher ability students. © 2004 by the Association for Childhood Education International.

AB  - This chapter presents a view of assessment in science education that departs significantly from the traditional "selecting and sorting" model that has become standard fare in the schools. The value of application tasks and problem sets has been recognized by generations of teachers, especially in knowledge domains such as physics, chemistry, and genetics. Novel problems that require a rationale or justification are clearly among the most valuable of these methods. Unfortunately, in the hands of less-experienced science teachers, problems and applications often become an exercise in memorizing a solution path or a simple algorithm. By way of comparison, an assessment strategy that depends on the longitudinal construction of concept maps along with structured, clinical interviews seems to offer a readily accessible way of tapping into both understanding and conceptual change. Another approach that offers similar advantages is the iterative construction of classroom artifacts. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined concept maps produced by personality psychology students as a function of different types of concept map instruction. The results indicated the number of quantitative items in the students' concept maps significantly increased from the pretest to the posttest, as would be expected over the course of an academic semester. More importantly, the type of instructions the students received at the pretest played a significant role in the number of cross links depicted in the maps at the posttest. I discuss the results in terms of the utility of instruction type when using concept maps in social science courses.

AB  - This study investigated the score exchangeability of concept maps with problem-solving essays. Of interest was whether sixth-grade students’ concept maps predicted their scores on essay responses that used concept map content. Concept maps were hypothesized to be alternatives to performance assessments for content-area domain knowledge in science. Both special (n = 16) and general (n = 16) education students participated in a science unit that covered three ecosystem cycles: (a) the water cycle, (b) the nitrogen cycle, and (c) the carbon dioxide-oxygen cycle. Assessment tasks required students to draw three concept maps and respond to two essay questions. Results showed that concept maps and essay tasks lacked consistent exchangeability. Findings indicated low predictive validity between map scores and essay scores and, thus, maps should not be considered alternative content-area domain assessments. © 2006, Sage Publications.

AB  - Concept browsing interfaces can help educators and learners to locate and use learning resources that are aligned with recognized learning goals. The Strand Map Service enables users to navigate interactive visualizations of related learning goals and to request digital library resources aligned with learning goals. These interfaces are created using a programmatic Web service interface that dynamically generates interactive visual components. Preliminary findings suggest that these library interfaces appear to help users stay focused on the scientific content of their information discovery task, as opposed to focusing on the mechanics of searching. © Springer-Verlag 2005.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping instruction, compared to traditional instruction (TI), on 8th grade students' understanding of solution concepts and their attitudes toward science as a school subject. Solution Concept Test was developed as a result of examination of related literature and interviews with teachers regarding their observations of students' difficulties. The test was administered to a total of 64 eighth grade students from two classes of a general science course, taught by the same teacher. The experimental group received the conceptual change texts accompanied with concept mapping in a lecture by the teacher. This instruction explicitly dealt with students' misconceptions. It was designed to suggest conditions in which misconceptions could be replaced by scientific conceptions and new conceptions could be integrated with existing conceptions. The control group received TI in which the teacher provided instruction through lecture and discussion methods. The results showed that conceptual change text accompanied with concept mapping instruction caused a significantly better acquisition of scientific conceptions related to solution concept and produced significantly higher positive attitudes toward science as a school subject than the TI. In addition, logical thinking ability and prior learning were strong predictors for the concept learning related to solution. © Springer 2005.

AB  - A concept map is a visual representation of concepts and their relationship to each other in a body of knowledge. They show the hierarchy of these concepts and emphasize the links between them. Concept maps are valuable pedagogical tools used to design the syllabus for an undergraduate structural geology course. Their value as an aid to student learning has been widely documented (Novak, 1990), and we have found them particularly suitable in the initial planning of courses such as structural geology where many new concepts are introduced. Concept maps used in the design stage of our structural geology course has resulted in a significant re-ordering of the topics. A more logical sequence begins with descriptive topics (joints and faults) and progresses to more abstract topics (stress and strain and continuum mechanics). The resultant sequence of topics is not that used in most traditional structural geology textbooks. Although it is not necessary for a course to be taught in the same sequence as material is presented in a textbook it is more convenient for students if it does.

AB  - Here, we discuss the development as well as the early assessment and implementation of a novel integrated curriculum in chemical engineering. This curriculum, based on block scheduling, consists of 6 main or "pillar" courses, augmented by a number of concurrent laboratory classes. The goal of this new curriculum is to foster integrated thinking beginning as early as the sophomore year, while at the same time enabling instructors to have the flexibility to utilize modern pedagogical tools. At present, the curriculum is in its pilot phase with 4 of 6 courses ongoing and corresponding assessment results being available for a subset of these. By using a world-class suite of assessment techniques including concept maps, concept inventories, and surveys, we hope to produce a truly validated success story that can serve as a model that is applicable for all engineering disciplines. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Research has established that students enter their science classes with ideas about the natural world that do not align with accepted scientific beliefs. The diagnosis of these student preconceptions may be seen as an initial, crucial step in the process of teacher-facilitated conceptual change. So as to capture what science teachers do in their everyday classroom routines to diagnose these student preconceptions, in-depth observations and interviews were conducted with four exemplary secondary science teachers. The teachers' strategies for diagnosing students' preconceptions, their use of information found through diagnosis, and the teachers' understanding of students' preinstructional ideas were all analyzed. The four teachers in this study did not use any formal assessment tools such as pretests, concept maps, interviews, or journal writing to diagnose students' ideas, although they all stated that finding out what students know prior to instruction is important. The teachers all declared that they used questioning to gather information on student ideas but were seen in their classes to rely heavily on low-level, recall questions. One of the teachers, the most experienced, did conduct class discussions where the students were encouraged to express their ideas and preconceptions. The four teachers' understanding of what student preconceptions consist of and the justification for attempting to diagnose these ideas was seen to be weak. The implications of these findings and recommendations for teacher training are made in the article. © 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The development of semantic networking and concept mapping has interesting parallels and important distinctions. They both have a substantial research base demonstrating their effectiveness as research and metacognitive tools. While grid systems for drawing structures may be familiar to the engineer and the artist, they have also been demonstrated to be useful in biology education. Roundhouse diagrams are named after the circular buildings with central turntables that are used by railroads for housing and switching locomotives. Another graphic metacognitive tool is Gowin's epistemological vee. Otherwise known as a vee diagram, this graphic allows one to view the actual activities of science as it moves from events to data collection to data transformations to knowledge claims to values claims as a research project is being planned or completed. Concept mapping requires an understanding of what a concept entails and promotes the ability to use concepts as the basis of scientific language. Concept mapping requires the map designer to prioritize and make judicious use of selected concepts when mapping. This may well serve proponents of science education reform who advocate. © 2005 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - An elaborated concept map that includes reactions of three types of organic molecules: hydrocarbons, organic halides and oxygen-containing compounds, can be used as a tool for teaching and learning organic chemistry at the secondary school level. A concept map can enable a better construction of cognitive structure, including concepts and correlations between them. At some point in the teaching/learning process the elaborated concept map can facilitate problem solving and in completing reaction schemes.

AB  - Hypermedia systems are increasingly being used in teaching/learning environments. Biomec is a hypermedia system that has got, as it main goal, the interrelation of concepts coming from Sports and Basic Mechanics, just as it is intended in an area of knowledge denominated Physics of Sports. The final objective of Biomec is to increase the efficiency of the learning processes in this area of study. The system development has been grounded in learning theories, with contents being organized according to the theory of Ausubel (1968) and the theory of cognitive flexibility (Spiro et al., 1992). Apparently, a hypermedia system like Biomec is suitable to the teaching/learning of Physical Education. However, only an astringent evaluation, with its target public, can assert what are its real benefits. This work presents a methodology for the evaluation and improvement of this kind of systems.

AB  - This article deals with adaptation techniques in the field of declarative knowledge learning. After explaining how concepts can be represented, it introduces a learner evaluation technique based on a concept maps analysis. The way an epistemic learner model can be made from this evaluation is then proposed. Finally, adaptation techniques based on this model are presented. With this method, different adaptation schemes can be applied to the document depending on the learner's errors. © Springer-Verlag 2004.

AB  - Previous research on affective extremity and social identity complexity suggested that women's mathematics stereotype threat might be alleviated by reminding individual women of their multiple roles and identities, most of which would presumably be unrelated and thus impervious to negative stereotypes regarding math performance. To test this hypothesis, we primed the relevant stereotype and then asked men and women college students to draw self-concept maps with many or few nodes. When they drew no maps or maps with few nodes, highly math-identified women scored significantly worse than highly math-identified men on a subsequent Graduate Record Examination-like math test, but when they drew maps with many nodes, they scored as well as those men. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed. © 2005 Springer Science + Business Media, Inc.

AB  - A reconnaissance study of the geology professional development program known as RockCamp was initiated to examine the sustained, or recurrent, participation of K-12 science teachers. Open-ended interviews, concept mapping, and creative writing assignments were used to explore the perceptions of six teachers possessing an exceptional record of participation. Efficacy, fun, right time of life, and support emerged as unanimous reasons for recurrent participation. Content, friendship, and methodology were very important. College credit was not critical. These teachers' perceptions suggest their sustained involvement in the RockCamp Program is stimulated by situated learning experiences stressing a compare, contrast, connect, and construct pedagogy within a supportive learning community.

AB  - Classical thermodynamics is restructured to start with practical applications where fundamental principles are introduced just-in-time and on a need-to-have basis. Theoretical information is presented to support the understanding of knowledge as students apply inquiry-based learning. Students assess their own knowledge in the process and produce concept maps linking fundamental principles to basic equations. This approach can be labeled as student-centered, concept-embedded, and problem-based. Students lead the lecture and discover knowledge (concepts) as they need it to solve practical real-world problems. They also gain practice in higher Bloom's Taxonomy levels of cognitive skills such as analysis, synthesis, and evaluation; skills that are much desired of engineers. The classroom format is interactive, somewhat informal, and revolves around students' needs. The traditional coverage of topics is packaged in the form of modules. Effectiveness of these modules is assessed using formative and summative tools and on a continuous basis. Undergraduate engineering students leave the course with enhanced thinking skills, and an increased level of retained knowledge.

AB  - Our overall objective is to help students develop the foundational capabilities needed to become successful software developers, that will help them learn how to effectively analyze, design, and implement software systems. The main focus of this paper is the development and use of a concept-based learning tool that helps students acquire effective analysis and design skills for the development of object-oriented programs. Concept maps are tools for organizing and representing knowledge; they enable learners to construct, navigate, share, and criticize knowledge models represented as augmented graphical concept maps. Using the concept map-based tool, students can use concept maps of object-oriented programming to help them solve problems. © 2003 IEEE.

AB  - The United Nations Security Council reports HIV/AIDS as the fastest growing threat to human development. In addition, the World Health Organization [1] reports that nearly 5 million persons (4.3 million adults and 700,000 children) are newly infected with HIV each year; more than 95%of them found in developing countries. Since STDs as a group are a personal problem which few people feel comfortable discussing, we believe that hand-held PDAs can provide an opportunity for learning about this disease while insuring anonymity. This device will employ the newest technologies including Bluetooth wireless technology, which can transmit and receive data via a short-range radio link using a globally available frequency band (2.4 GHz ISM band), enabling rapid and accurate synchronous and asynchronous data communication. The first generation of Bluetooth permits exchange of data up to a rate of 1 Mbps, even in areas with much electromagnetic disturbance. This emerging technology can facilitate HIV/AIDS outreach around the globe. Recent advances in learning have taken a particularly cognitive perspective and these findings have implications for education in general as well as for the development of intelligent tutoring systems in particular. In the past, effective SmartBooks™have been developed for AIDS education to disseminate the critical knowledge relevant to this epidemic [2]. Since 1993, the proliferation of the World Wide Web has created a plethora of new opportunities for the delivery of electronic distance learning systems. However, we feel that it is important that a whatever technology is employed is based on a sound educational theory. A new, comprehensive, web-based learning system called SmartTutor has been developed, at Brooklyn College of The City University of New York [3]. This technology provides a user-friendly, self-paced, easy to modify, software environment intended to serve the user's learning needs and is based on a generic SmartTutor methodology organized around the use of concept mapping. Early assessment of SmartTutor has shown that it is well received by students and helps significantly in their learning processes. It is readily adaptable to the presentation of academic and more general subject matter such as the latest available information on HIV/AIDS. Our new HIV/AIDS SmartTutor will incorporate this SmartTutor paradigm. Our new SmartTutor would provide worldwide access to medical professionals as well as the general public to learn about HIV/AIDS. This new device could also provide a survey tool to facilitate HIV risk assessment. Demonstrations of the SmartTutor learning system will be presented and the continued development of the applications will be discussed. © 2005 The authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - Using concept maps and clinical interviews, we assessed the extent to which undergraduate students restructure their conceptual knowledge at progressively more sophisticated levels over the course of a two-semester lecture-based physical geology sequence. Students completed concept mapping exercises and clinical interviews at regular intervals throughout the two semesters and data indicated that the course did not address integration of concepts into student knowledge domains. Concept maps and clinical interviews both illustrated acquisition of geologic concepts longitudinally with a disproportionately small increase in integration of those concepts into frameworks of understanding. However, concept maps and clinical interviews appear to be viable and complementary approaches in determining the degree to which student accomplishment objectives are being met.

AB  - This article provides a model for the professional development of elementary science teachers. The model focused on integrating different domains of knowledge into science teaching, including the knowledge of the science curriculum, especially scientific inquiry, teacher's knowledge, and students' knowledge. The two case studies in this article revealed that the teachers construct their knowledge in a social context. The constant reflections on the experiences helped them to generate alternative teaching approaches. The findings suggest that the model of the project had two functions. First, it provides a useful strategy to help science teachers to bridge the gap between theories of teaching and their own teaching practices. Second, it provides a social learning environment for learning how to teach science. © National Science Council.

AB  - Most of the intelligent tutoring system (ITS) is used to deliver knowledge and train skills based on the expert model. According to the theories of leaning, learning by teaching method is more efficient for enhancing motivation to learn and cognitive ability than learning by listening or learning by reading. For the purpose of developing an adaptive intelligent agent to enhance the motivation to learn, the new type of teachable agent were designed and implemented, the KORI (KORea university Intelligent agent), in which the user plays a role of a tutor by teaching the agent using a concept map, posing questions, and providing feedbacks. KORI consists of four independent modules: teach module, Q&A module, test module, and resource module. In teach module, the KORI's knowledge is structured and organized through the concept map and the KORI makes new knowledge from the inference engine. In Q&A module, the KORI can provide answers to the users' questions through an interactive window. It is expected that providing the user with the active role of teaching the agent enhance the motivation to learn and the positive attitude toward the subject matter as well as cognition. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - This chapter focuses on the importance of concept maps for effectively teaching science students. Students who learn meaningfully relate information from different sources in an attempt to integrate what they learn with the intention of imposing meaning. They form connections between new information and material that has been previously studied, and they think about the underlying structure of what is learned. Concept maps have been particularly helpful in representing qualitative aspects of students' learning. They may also be used by students as a study tool or by teachers to evaluate learning, enhance teaching, or facilitate curriculum planning. Concept mapping is a tool for representing the interrelationships among concepts in an integrated, hierarchical manner. Concept maps depict the structure of knowledge in propositional statements that dictate the relationships among the concepts in a map. Concept maps provide a useful approach for promoting and assessing meaningful learning by providing a tangible record of conceptual understanding. Not only are concept maps useful for determining whether, or to what extent, shared meaning has occurred, but they also portray the areas where it has not been achieved. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Mineralogy is usually the first geology course taken by students above the 100 level, and as such it is a vital building block for geology curricula. In recent years the number of mineralogists has declined, the relevance of the field has been questioned, and as a result the course has often been taught by less than enthusiastic non-specialists in the field. We believe that the key to restructuring mineralogy involves setting reasonable, prioritized course goals and employing (at least) four modern pedagogical learning methods: spiral learning, inquiry-based learning, concept maps, and use of interactive models and visualization. We present here a revised mineralogy curriculum that benefits from reflections on appropriate content and on these new learning methods teaching styles.

AB  - Concept maps (CM) are informal, semantic, node-link conceptual graphs used to represent knowledge in a variety of applications. Algorithms that compare concept maps would be useful in supporting educational processes and in leveraging indexed digital collections of concept maps. Map comparison begins with element matching and faces computational challenges arising from vocabulary overlap, informality, and organizational variation. Our implementation of an adapted similarity flooding algorithm improves matching of CM knowledge elements over a simple string matching approach.

AB  - In this article we present an in silico method that automatically assigns putative functions to DNA sequences. The annotations are at an increasingly conceptual level, up to identifying general biomedical fields to which the sequences could contribute. This bioinformatics datamining system makes substantial use of several resources: a locally stored MEDLINE® database; a manually built classification system; the MeSH® taxonomy; relational technology; and bioinformatics methods. Knowledge is generated from various data sources by using well-defined semantics, and by exploiting direct links between them. A two-dimensional "Concept Map™" displays the knowledge graph, which allows causal connections to be followed. The use of this method has been valuable and has saved considerable time in our in-house projects, and can be generally exploited for any sequence-annotation or knowledge-condensation task. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The Strand Map Service provides programmatic access to AAAS strand maps that can be used by educational digital libraries to dynamically build resource discovery interfaces. The programmatic access to strand maps is enabled by the Concept Space Interchange Protocol, which provide following services (1) service capability determination, (2) resource alignment, and (3) search and retrieval of dynamically generated strand maps. The protocol is implemented as a web service and integration experiments have been performed for two educational digital libraries. In this poster we describe the Concept Space Interchange Protocol and its integration with educational digital libraries. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

AB  - The concept mapping method is presented in the current study as a new tool to assess the learning process taking part in the hallmark of a nutritional education program addressed to obese diabetic patients. Population: eight patients were interviewed prior to and after completion of 1-week in-hospital stay during which concept maps were designed. Concept maps quantitative and qualitative analysis disclose both (i) the importance of previous knowledge among patients prior to nutritional education and (ii) the maintenance of misconceptions after it. Nutritional education allows patients to acquire and structure their knowledge while providing them with a certain amount of medical vocabulary. An underlying correlation between concept maps design and the results of psychological tests identifying eating behaviour troubles (EBT), depression or anxiety has not been clearly identified. However, the nutritional education is more beneficial to those patients with a higher degree of self-assertiveness and with a lesser degree of anxiety, depression and eating disorder. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - The AstraZeneca-Exeter Science through Telematics (AZEST) project provided evidence that the Internet has much potential as a communication channel for the provision and discussion of INSET materials for primary science in the UK. Participating teachers were able to access and use the project website effectively, were more likely to provide feedback when they had personal access to the Internet either at home or at school, and provided valuable feedback concerning the AZEST tasks, but they tended not to respond directly to messages from other participants. Discussion, via e-mail or a web-based discussion forum, was enhanced if participants knew each other personally. There was evidence that the AZEST science INSET materials enhanced teachers' understanding of science concepts and raised their confidence, increased teachers' effectiveness in the role of Science Subject Leader, and improved teachers' pedagogic practice through encouraging innovative investigative approaches to the teaching and learning of science. Participating teachers indicated that a website dedicated to primary science at the local level was valued. Concept mapping was found to be a valuable tool for stimulating discussion and for assessing pupils' and teachers' understanding and was mostly enjoyed by pupils and staff.

AB  - Researching self-regulated learning (SRL) as a process that evolves across multiple episodes of studying poses large methodological challenges. While self-report data provide useful information about learners' perceptions of learning, these data are not reliable indicators of studying tactics learners actually use while studying, especially when learners are young children. We argue that self-reports about SRL need to be augmented by fine-grained traces that are records of learners' actual activities as they study. We describe how gStudy software unobtrusively collects detailed trace data about learners' use of study tactics as they engage with content presented in learning kits-collections of documents (e.g., texts, graphics, video clips) and tasks (e.g., notes, concept maps) on which learners operate to study. We suggest that trace data can advance research about how learners select, monitor, assemble, rehearse, and translate information to learn it, and provide raw materials for mapping SRL and its effects. Examples from the Life Cycles Learning Kit that supports grade 1 students learning about the life cycles of humans and frogs are given. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2006.

AB  - This paper proposes a method of constructing navigation agents that provide more personalized Web navigation by exploiting domain-specific ontologies. In general, ontology is regarded as the specification of conceptualization that enables formal definitions about things and states by using terms and relationships between them. In our approach, Web pages are converted into concepts by referring to domain-specific ontologies which employ a hierarchical concept structure. This concept mapping makes it easy to handle Web pages, and also provides higher level classification information. The proposed navigation agent eventually recommends the Web documents that are associated with the concept nodes in the upper-levels of the hierarchy by analyzing the current Web page and its outwardly-linked pages. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2005.

AB  - This three-part article begins with a brief presentation of a framework that describes different approaches to conduct and report research on expert knowledge. The framework contrasts direct vs. indirect approaches and provides examples of each. Second, the article gives a detailed description of the methods and results of three concept mapping studies in pulmonary physiology that employ Pathfinder scaling, an indirect approach. The studies derive concepts maps for a variety of faculty experts individually and in groups. Two of the studies focus on changes in students' concept maps of the pulmonary physiology concepts as a result of instruction. Changes are gauged in terms of the degree to which students' concept maps approximate instructors' concept maps due to educational interventions. An index of student-instructor concept map similarity is also correlated with student performance on final examinations. The article concludes by articulating several "next steps" in the Feinberg Northwestern and Wisconsin program of health sciences education research on concept mapping using Pathfinder scaling.

AB  - Teachers always want to know how much their students had learned in classes. The most convenient way to discover learning status is 'test'. Each item on a test sheet always contains one or more concepts used to check whether a student really understands or not. Teachers can also And a student's misconceptions out via the concept relations stored in a test sheet. In order to make the diagnosis process simple, teachers always take concept maps as their test development and learning diagnosis tools. This paper implements a SCORM/IMS compliance online test and diagnosis system base on concept maps. In the system, it has more than 5000 members and generates real-time learning report for misconception diagnosis over 500 times monthly. The members are the third-year student at junior high school and come from different counties and cities all over the country. Currently, the system covers 11 courses such as Chinese, English, Physics, History, and Earth Science. It's obviously the system is useful for both teachers and students. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - This paper describes an ongoing study on the use of concept maps in an upper-division chemical engineering laboratory to enhance student learning. The Unit Operations Laboratory was chosen for the study since it is a comprehensive laboratory in which students are required to be familiar with various aspects of chemical engineering practice. The study was implemented in three stages. In the first stage the students were introduced to the idea and construction of concept maps. The second stage involved the construction of concept maps during a pre-lab session in which the students were orally tested about the exercise they were about to undertake. The last stage was the submission of the final reports in which the students were again required to hand in other concept maps. The students completed the lab practice in groups of three to four, and were asked to create both individual as well as collective concept maps. The present study produced three tentative findings. First, the first stage mainly produced simple concept maps that barely contained basic chemical engineering principles. These initial maps, however, developed and became more complicated as the students went on completing the lab practice and subsequently preparing the report. Secondly, it appears that each student wanted his/her contribution in the collective concept map construction to be acknowledged. Thus, the students were believed to be motivated. Thirdly, since the concept maps produced were collected and displayed in the lab for comparison with the subsequent lab sessions, the students seemed to get a feeling of continuity, something that is not normally noticeable in the traditional lab practice. These findings indicate that concept mapping has a positive effect on student learning. The paper ends with a discussion on the study with respect to its pedagogical values and applicability to other courses. © 2006 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - Learning (memorizing) mineral formulae and analytical techniques and procedures can represent two of the more odious tasks facing students in Mineralogy courses. Yet, familiarity with mineral formulae facilitates the assimilation of many concepts dealing with mineral structures, coordination, and element substitutions, in addition to setting a context for geochemical problems encountered in other courses. Likewise, familiarity with a range of analytical techniques and equipment can open the door for valuable undergraduate research experiences, and lead to success in obtaining increasingly analytical entry-level jobs in geoscience-related fields. In-class discussion and flexible assessment schedules substantially improved retention of mineral formulae from one semester to the next, as opposed to other methods of "learning." Students are given the opportunity to "take control of" their course grade by having the option of retaking mineral formulae quizzes, at the same time increasing short-term utility and long-term retention. In-class discussions and concept mapping of formulae were used to help students develop a context for the use and meaning of formulae. An inquiry-based approach to the learning of analytical techniques and equipment allows students to experiment with various aspects of the analysis of minerals. Precision and accuracy, sample preparation, pitfalls and shortcuts, in addition to the most efficient way of implementing the equipment are best discovered by trial-and-error. Students are assigned a piece of equipment or analytical method and must develop a Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) based on their understanding of the equipment. Presentation of their SOP facilitates discussion on similarities and differences, while introducing the entire class to a wide range of procedures.

AB  - The purposes of this study were to examine the effects of integrating concept mapping into computer assisted instruction in Biology class at a comprehensive high school, and to realize students' academic achievements and their learning retention. First, the theoretical framework of integrating concept mapping into computer-assisted instruction was developed. Secondly, the relative software of integrating concept mapping into computer-assisted instruction was built up. Then, a quasi-experiment was practiced. There were 39 subject students of this study obtained from a single class in a comprehensive high school. The subjects were divided into high and low proficiency levels after pretest. The experimental instruction lasted for seven weeks. Statistical methods such as t-test, ANOVA, and path analysis were applied to analyze data. The major findings of the study are briefly stated as follows. The effect of integrating the concept mapping into computer assisted instruction was positive on academic achievements of learning biology subject. It was also helpful for learning retention and raising cognitive ability of the biology subject. In addition, there was the same influence on students' academic achievements regardless of their genders. Furthermore, subjects possessed an affirmative attitude toward integrating the concept mapping into computer assisted instruction. Finally, subjects suggested that the developed software was a good material for assisting instruction in the biology class.

AB  - Nowadays the European Universities are worried about how to adapt higher education to the new European Higher Education Area, as proposed in the Bologna Magna Charta Universitatum of 1998, and signed by 32 European Education Ministers. One of the key points in this higher education reform was the introduction of new Master's level curricula. These Masters will look for the professional specialization and they will have to be adapted to the specific skills demanded by the society. This paper presents the results from a cooperation project - funded by the AECI (International Cooperation Spanish Agency) and developed between the University of Seville (Spain) and the Catholic University of Asuncion (Paraguay) - by about the planning of a new master's level curriculum in digital signal processing (DSP) area, taking into account the Bologna principles and the conclusions obtained by the Career Space Consortium. A scientific method from social science, known as concept mapping techniques, was used to perform this planning. Basically, the idea of concept mapping consists of compiling the opinion from actors belonging to different environments (lecturers, researchers, workers, businessmen, etc.) related to DSP applications. The compiled data were statistically computed to cluster the opinions of the different agents. The result will be a master's level curricula adapted to the environment requirements and the social settings. © Springer 2006.

AB  - Several abstract concepts in medical education are difficult to teach and comprehend. In order to address this challenge, we have been applying the approach of reification of abstract concepts using interactive virtual environments and a knowledge-based design. Reification is the process of making abstract concepts and events, beyond the realm of direct human experience, concrete and accessible to teachers and learners. Entering virtual worlds and simulations not otherwise easily accessible provides an opportunity to create, study, and evaluate the emergence of knowledge and comprehension from the direct interaction of learners with otherwise complex abstract ideas and principles by bringing them to life. Using a knowledge-based design process and appropriate subject matter experts, knowledge structure methods are applied in order to prioritize, characterize important relationships, and create a concept map that can be integrated into the reified models that are subsequently developed. Applying these principles, our interdisciplinary team has been developing a reified model of the nephron into which important physiologic functions can be integrated and rendered into a three dimensional virtual environment called Flatland, a virtual environments development software tool, within which a learners can interact using off-the-shelf hardware. The nephron model can be driven dynamically by a rules-based artificial intelligence engine, applying the rules and concepts developed in conjunction with the subject matter experts. In the future, the nephron model can be used to interactively demonstrate a number of physiologic principles or a variety of pathological processes that may be difficult to teach and understand. In addition, this approach to reification can be applied to a host of other physiologic and pathological concepts in other systems. These methods will require further evaluation to determine their impact and role in learning. © 2006 The authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the effectiveness of combining conceptual change text and concept mapping strategy on students' understanding of diffusion and osmosis. Students' conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis was measured using the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test developed by Odom and Barrow (1995). The test was administered as pretest and post-test to a total of 44 ninth-grade students in two intact classes of the same high school located in an urban area. The experimental group was a class of 24 students who received concept mapping and conceptual change text instruction. A class of 20 students comprised the control group who received a traditional instruction. Group Assessment of Logical Thinking Test (GALT) and pretest scores were used as covariates in this study. A pretest-post-test control group design utilising the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the favour of the experimental group after treatment. The results indicated that while the average percentage of students in the experimental group holding a scientifically correct view had risen from 22.5% to 54.1%, a gain of 31.6%, the percentage of correct responses of the students in the control group had increased from 19.1% to 38.7%, a gain of 19.6% after treatment. © 2003, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - A research program at Cornell University that sought to study the ability of children to acquire science concepts and the effect of this learning on later schooling led to the need for a new tool to describe explicit changes in children's conceptual understanding. Concept mapping was invented in 1972 to meet this need, and subsequently numerous other uses have been found for this tool. Underlying the research program and the development of the concept mapping tool was an explicit cognitive psychology of learning and an explicit constructivist epistemology. In 1987, collaboration began between Novak and Cãas and others at the Florida Institute for Human and Machine Cognition, then part of the University of West Florida. Extending the use of concept mapping to other applications such as the integration of concept mapping with the World Wide Web (WWW) led to the development of software that enhanced the potential of concept mapping, evolving into the current version of CmapTools now used worldwide in schools, universities, corporations, and governmental and non-governmental agencies. Differences between concept maps and other knowledge representation tools are described. The integration of concept mapping software programs with the WWW and other new technologies permits a new kind of concept map-centred learning environment wherein learners build their own knowledge models, individually or collaboratively, and these can serve as a basis for life-long meaningful learning. Combined with other educational practices, use of CmapTools permits a New Model for Education. Preliminary studies are underway to assess the possibilities of this New Model. © 2006 Palgrave Macmillan Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This chapter demonstrates how the relevant investigation of the history and philosophy of science can contribute to the thorough preparation that is required for constructivistic teaching of the particle theory at the seventh-grade level. For some educators, the common usage of "content analysis"may merely represent an initial process that results in a list of terms, concepts, principles, or theories. It is the format in which syllabi are usually submitted. For others, it may refer to the concept-mapping process of an area of knowledge. Concept mapping is indeed a significant step forward when compared to a linear-style list, as it visually emphasizes which ideas are more central or inclusive than others. Content analysis maps the subject from a disciplinary perspective. Cognitive analysis of content, on the other hand, examines the product of the former analysis from the student's cognitive perspective. It identifies genuine cognitive demands that are presented to the learner by the various components of a concept list or map. It also attempts to identify the potential sources for the cognitive and/or emotional difficulties presented by the various content elements, especially by the most central ideas and concepts. Many children and adolescents may believe that nonliving objects behave purposefully. For example, air wants to escape from a hot container or opposing electrical charges want to stay together. When preparing for constructivist teaching that is aimed at achieving conceptual change in students, it is important to identify and clarify the unique problems of the specific teaching subject. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - The search for authentic science research tools to evaluate student understanding in a hybrid learning environment with a large multimedia component has resulted in the use of concept maps as a representation of student's knowledge organization. One hundred and seventy third-semester introductory university-level engineering students represented their understanding related to the atom in a concept map. A qualitative analysis of the data presented a more informative and complete picture of students' understanding as compared with most prominent scoring techniques in the literature. The detailed analysis method is illustrated by means of some students' concept maps and the overall results of the entire student population are discussed. The most striking difference between common and more insightful maps is the inclusion of additional clusters describing models of the atom, beyond the clusters that just describe the elements of atoms (e.g. protons, electrons, etc.) and their characteristics. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - Constructing quality assessment rubrics can be challenging, especially when they are used for integrated, group-centered, applied learning. We describe a collaborative assessment task in which groups of second-year dentistry students developed a complex concept map. In groups of four, the students were given a written, simulated, medical history of a patient and required to construct a concept map illustrating relevant pathophysiological concepts and pharmacological interventions. This report describes a research project aimed at making educational goals of the task more explicit through investigating student and faculty member understandings of the criteria that might be used to assess the concept map. Information was gathered about the perceptions of students in relation to the learning goals associated with the task. These were compared with faculty member perceptions. The findings were used to develop an assessment rubric intended to be more accessible to learners. The new rubric used the language of both faculty members and students to more clearly represent expectations of each criterion and standard. This assessment rubric will be used in 2005 for the next phase of the project. Copyright © 2005 The American Physiological Society.

AB  - While attempting to infuse more ocean science research into K-16 classrooms, museums and aquaria, the New England Regional Center for Ocean Sciences Education Excellence (NER-COSEE) is focused on identifying excellent examples of ocean science education. However, without a "map" of ocean sciences, it is difficult or impossible to meet the needs of both the research and education communities. Therefore, we are using a combination of surveys, small working groups, concept mapping strategies, and collaboration across the ocean science community to produce a simplified web of age appropriate ocean science concepts along with excellent examples of how to teach these concepts.

AB  - This paper describes MECUREO, a system that automatically constructs an ontology from a dictionary. We describe its use in the context of a dictionary of computer science. MECUREO parses this to construct a graph representing a lightweight ontology of computer science. The paper describes MECUREO's approach to parsing the dictionary and the construction of the ontology graph. We also describe MECUREO's point query facility. This generates a small ontology for use in a particular teaching context, such as single lesson. We report two evaluations of the effectiveness of the ontology construction, one based on a qualitative concept mapping experiment, and the other, on a quantitative comparison of the computer science ontology with another similar ontology.

AB  - The complex nature of climate change science poses special challenges for educators. Learners come to the classroom with prior knowledge on the topic, which serves as a foundation for further knowledge building, but can also pose barriers to conceptual change. Learners have existing mental models that may limit their perception and processing of conflicting information and prevent adoption of scientific conceptions. Instructional strategies that attempt conceptual change by simply provoking cognitive conflict have had limited success due to the importance of epistemological beliefs and motivation to the conceptual change process. The Mock Environment Summit course uses role-playing, argumentation and discussion to heighten epistemological awareness and motivation and thereby facilitate conceptual change. The pre/post-course concept map evaluation of students' knowledge about the science of global climate change reported here shows evidence of significant learning and conceptual change. Our study also provides useful information about gaps in knowledge and the types of misconceptions students are likely to have about this topic. Insight gained from this assessment study can be used to tailor the curriculum and enhance student progress towards more scientific conceptions of the problem.

AB  - In this paper the development of prototype instructional modules for teaching Control Flow Theory is discussed. The modules are intended for use by practicing engineers as a self-paced, asynchronous, personalized learning material, either on-line or off-line. First, the motivation of this work and the selection of software used in the modules are presented, then the lessons learned in the development process are further discussed and future improvements of the modules are proposed. The technical content of each module was organized using concept maps, specifically the software produced by the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC CmapTools v2.9.1). Most of the animation used in modules is produced in Macromedia's Flash, supplemented by scientific simulations realized in Mathcad. Each user's progress in covering the material is tracked using Macromedia's Authorware capabilities. The difference between Authorware and a Learning Management System such as WebCT is also discussed.

AB  - Modules are described that provide experimental/analytical investigation of traditional chemical engineering concepts within the framework of a solar/hydrogen renewable energy cycle. Module lessons cover photovoltaics, thermodynamics, stoichiometry, characteristic current-voltage curves/efficiency, kinetics and transport. A self-contained solar panel / electrolyzer / gas storage containers / polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) device along with separately purchased (or borrowed) spotlight, power supply, multimeters, and decade resistors are used for all experiments. The experiments are of short duration (15-50 minutes), simple, and produce data that can be analyzed by/used to verify traditional chemical engineering relations (given a few supplemental electrochemical engineering equations). The equipment used in the modules is inexpensive, simple to operate, safe, portable and commercially available. Ideally, this will permit multiple "systems" to be purchased and used simultaneously by students, providing a truly hands-on small group experience. Modules can be used at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum (freshman through senior) and can be used in multiple classes (Freshman Engineering, Intro to Chemical Engineering, Thermodynamics, Kinetics, Transport, Laboratory Practice, and Electives) to illustrate appropriate material. Figure 1 contains a concept map linking modules to concepts within the curricula that are addressed in this paper. Use of the modules can be preceded by classroom discussions of the hydrogen economy, its projected political, social, and environmental impacts (both locally and globally) and/or the challenges associated with converting to such an economy. The modules can also be modified for use at the pre-college level for a wide variety of projects and/or simple in-class or public demonstrations.

AB  - This paper discusses the extensions that we have made to Betty's Brain teachable agent system to help students learn about dynamic processes in a river ecosystem. Students first learn about dynamic behavior in a simulation environment, and then teach Betty by introducing cycles into the concept map representation. Betty's qualitative reasoning mechanisms have been extended so that she can reason about cycles and determine how entities change over time. Preliminary experiments were conducted to study and analyze the usefulness of the simulation. Analysis of the students' protocols was very revealing, and the lessons learnt have led to redesigned simulation interfaces. A new study with the system will be conducted in a fifth grade science classroom in May, 2005. © 2005 The authors. All rights reserved.

AB  - In 2002 the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point established a nuclear engineering (NE) major beginning with graduates of the Class of 2005. The major represents a significant broadening of the West Point academic program and will provide the Army with additional nuclear trained officers as leaders in homeland defense, health physics, and the development of national nuclear defense and policy. A four-step evaluation and assessment process has been developed to assess accomplishment of program goals. Through the use of concept maps, block learning objectives, rubrics, and embedded evaluation instruments, changes to the program can be made while ensuring that USMA continues to graduate outstanding officers and leaders.

AB  - Science content area texts are difficult for most middle school students, particularly whose reading skills are below grade level. This article describes an innovative approach to integrating the teaching of middle school science content and reading skills to increase levels of student success with content area textbooks. For reading instruction, this approach features carefully selected vocabulary, word reading instruction, oral (including partner reading) and silent reading with reading fluency practice as needed, and explicit instruction on comprehension strategies, such as retelling, concept mapping, and summarization. The teaching of the science content incorporates instructional design principles that have been documented to improve comprehension of science content, process skills, and higher order thinking. Six aspects of instructional design that are discussed are the identification and teaching of big ideas, the systematic instruction of vocabulary (including science affixes), a review and integration of core concepts, visual displays of how core concepts are integrated, mnemonics for core concepts, and structured hands-on activities. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The research focus on children's science has recently shifted from separate concepts to more comprehensive and complex topics. This study addressed pupils' understanding of the complex topic of energy flow and matter cycling. A scoring system with three categories and six concepts was developed and used by four biology teachers to analyze 106 pupils' concept maps. The results indicate that most of the pupils failed to recognize the interrelationships among the various concepts concerned with units of energy flow and matter cycling. It was the relationship between the living world and the non-living world that presented the greatest difficult to understanding. This paper concludes with suggestions for curriculum development and biology teaching.

AB  - Computer supported learning systems such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems, web-based learning systems, etc. gather data from students' interaction. Teachers and students may find useful a medium to inspect information of students and student groups in an intuitive way. This paper presents DynMap+, an approach to generate and visualize Group Student Models generated from data gathered by a computer supported learning system. DynMap+ represents student models graphically by means of Concept Maps. Some graphical resources are used to highlight important data. The use of those resources allows DynMap+ to provide users (e.g. teachers) with a viewpoint that helps him/her to make decisions in order to improve the students learning process. The generated group student models record not only the last state of knowledge of the students but also their evolution during the learning sessions. As the knowledge of the students change over time, the updating of those models is also considered. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

AB  - This study is intended to develop an assessment instrument to investigate students' understandings about internal transport in plants and human circulatory system. A refined process of a two-tier diagnostic test was used to develop the instrument. Finally, three versions of the Internal Transport in Plants and the Human Circulatory System test were developed for different educational levels: elementary, secondary and high school level. The test-retest reliability, the degree of difficulty, and the range of discrimination were found to be reasonable for all three versions. The statistical variances across educational levels of the verification samples and the test applications are discussed. The students' major alternative conceptions on internal transport of plants and human were classified into three attributes of explanations: interconnectedness, language and anthropomorphism. Based on the nature of students' explanations, card-sorting with justification, learning cycle and concept mapping were recommended for in-depth learning of the concept. © National Science Council, Taiwan 2004.

AB  - Concept maps that integrate and relate concepts in a nonlinear fashion are widely accepted as an educational tool that can underpin meaningful learning in medical education. However, student take-up may be affected by a number of cognitive and non-cognitive influences. In the present study, student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 conjoint MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were examined in relation to preferred learning styles according to the Felder-Silverman model. There was no statistically significant influence of dichotomous learning style dimension (sensing/intuitive; visual/verbal; active/reflector; sequential/global) on the self-reported utility of such concept maps to learning. However, when strength of preference was analysed within each dimension, moderate/strong verbal learners were found to be significantly less likely to self-report concept maps as useful relative to mild verbal learners. With this important exception, these data now suggest that student attitudes to concept maps are broadly not influenced by preferred learning styles and furthermore highlight the potential of concept maps to address a variety of different learning styles and thereby facilitate 'teaching to all types'. Concept maps could therefore potentially assist motivation, engagement and deep learning in medical and biomedical science education when used as a supplement to more traditional teaching/learning activities. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - Concept mapping activities were trialed over a 2 year period as part of an undergraduate microbiology course. This paper describes this developmental process and offers insight into the most beneficial ways of employing this tool in a higher education setting. The aim was to investigate the use of mapping activities to improve students' integration of the material presented and as a method of course evaluation. It was found that the emphasis placed on concepts at the beginning of the course had a profound influence on the trajectory of conceptual development exhibited by students. Once established, initial conceptual structures seemed resistant to change and restricted the subsequent choice of superordinate concepts. The approach was modified in the second year. Students were encouraged to restructure their understanding by producing a concept map as part of a collaborative group. The concept labels were prescribed and excluded the terminology that had appeared to constrain conceptual development in the previous year. Findings suggest that in order to optimize concept mapping activities they should: (1) reflect a student‐centred teaching philosophy; (2) be collaborative; (3) be given sufficient time for reflection and development; (4) avoid using specific terms that restrict conceptual development by hindering appropriate switching between opposing conceptual frameworks. Linking the mapping activity to course grades provided an extrinsic motivation for active engagement in the task. © 2005 NATFHE.

AB  - In this article, we adopted the relational conceptual change as our theoretical framework to accommodate current views of conceptual change such as ontological beliefs, epistemological commitment, and social/affective contexts commonly mentioned in the literature. We used a specific concept mapping formal and process-digraphs and digraphing-as an operational framework for assessing and promoting relational conceptual change. We wanted to find out how concept mapping can be used to account for relational conceptual change. We collected data from a Grade 12 chemistry class using collaborative computerized concept mapping on an ongoing basis during a unit of instruction. Analysis of progressive concept maps and interview transcripts of representative students and the teacher showed that ongoing and collaborative computerized concept mapping is able to account for student conceptual change in ontological, epistemological, and social/affective domains. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The crisis in science education and the need for in-novative computer-based learning environments has prompted us to develop a multi-agent system, Betty's Brain that implements the learning by teaching paradigm. The design and implementation of the system based on cognitive science and education research in constructivist, inquiry-based learning, involves an intelligent software agent, Betty, that students teach using concept map repre-sentations with a visual interface. Betty is intelli-gent not because she learns on her own, but because she can apply qualitative-reasoning techniques to answer questions that are directly related to what she has been taught. The results of an extensive study in a fifth grade classroom of a Nashville pub-lic school has demonstrated impressive results in terms of improved motivation and learning gains. Reflection on the results has prompted us to de-velop a new version of this system that focuses on formative assessment and the teaching of self-regulated strategies to improve students' learning, and promote better understanding and transfer.

AB  - In this paper we critically review and analyze previous research on collaborative concept mapping in both face-to-face and networked environments. Although research has shown the positive effects of collaborative concept mapping on learning in face-to-face learning environments, there is a dearth of research which specifically focuses on the potential value of adopting collaborative concept mapping in online learning environments. Newly developed concept mapping software which operates via the Internet makes it possible for distance learners to implement concept mapping as a learning tool for coconstructing knowledge. Using our analysis of current research we provide some directions for future research in the use of concept mapping for online learning. © 2005 international Society of the Learning sciences.

AB  - This article reports the results of an investigation of the convergent criterionrelated validity of two computer-based tools for scoring concept maps and essays as part of the ongoing formative evaluation of these tools. In pairs, participants researched a science topic online and created a concept map of the topic. Later, participants individually wrote a short essay from their concept map. The concept maps and essays were scored by the computerbased tools and by human raters using rubrics. Computer-based concept map scores were a very good measure of the qualitative aspects of the concept maps (r = 0.84) and were an adequate measure of the quantitative aspects (r = 0.65). Also, the computer-based essay scores were an adequate measure of essay content (r = 0.71). If computer-based approaches for scoring concept maps and essays can provide a valid, low-cost, easy to use, and easy to interpret measure of students' content knowledge, then these approaches will likely gain rapid acceptance by teachers at all levels. © 2005, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.

AB  - The solution of complex, unstructured problems is faced with policy controversy and dispute, unused and misused knowledge, project delay and failure, and decline of public trust in governmental decisions. Mental model mapping (also called concept mapping) is a technique to analyse these difficulties on a fundamental cognitive level, which can reveal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, knowledge and subjective beliefs of stakeholders, experts and other actors, and can stimulate communication and learning. This article presents the theoretical framework from which the use of mental model mapping techniques to analyse this type of problems emerges as a promising technique. The fra mework consists of the problem solving or policy design cycle, the knowledge production or modelling cycle, and the (computer) model as interface between the cycles. Literature attributes difficulties in the decision-making process to communication gaps between decision makers, stakeholders and scientists, and to the construction of knowledge within different paradigm groups that leads to different interpretation of the problem situation. Analysis of the decision-making process literature indicates that choices, which are made in all steps of the problem solving cycle, are based on an individual decision maker's frame of perception. This frame, in turn, depends on the mental model residing in the mind of the individual. Thus we identify three levels of awareness on which the decision process can be analysed. This research focuses on the third level. Mental models can be elicited using mapping techniques. In this way, analysing an individual's mental model can shed light on decision-making problems. The steps of the knowledge production cycle are, in the same manner, ultimately driven by the mental models of the scientist in a specific discipline. Remnants of this mental model can be found in the resulting computer model. The characteristics of unstructu red problems (complexity, uncertainty and disagreement) can be positioned in the framework, as can the communities of knowledge construction and valuation involved in the solution of these problems (core science, applied science, and professional consultancy, and "post-normal" science). Mental model maps, this research hypothesises, are suitable to analyse the above aspects of the problem. This hypothesis is tested for the case of the Zwolle storm surch barrier. Analysis can aid integration between disciplines, participation of public stakeholders, and can stimulate learning processes. Mental model mapping is recommended to visualise the use of knowledge, to analyse difficulties in problem solving process, and to aid information transfer and communication. Mental model mapping help scientists to shape their new, post-normal responsibilities in a manner that complies with integrity when dealing with unstructured problems in complex, multifunctional systems. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - BMT (bone marrow transplantation) is acknowledged as one of the most stressful treatments in modern cancer care. When investigating the impact of BMT on patients it is crucial that the analytic method employed captures direct patient perceptions, allowing the patient to define the domains under investigation. In this study, a multivariate analytic method, concept mapping (CM), was used to identify perceived stressors among 109 allogeneic BMT recipients. CM employs multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses to empirically identify the structure underlying the investigated conceptual domain. The analyses of the BMT stress data resulted in an eight-cluster solution. The stress clusters, ranked from the most severe to the least severe, were identified as: Change of life and impact of long-lasting treatment; Side-effects; Distress related to treatment outcome and physiological status; Family-related stress; Fear of death and depressive thoughts; Other concerns; Negative social support; and Stress related to lack of information and the medical staff. A number of stressors generated by the patients were quite novel, and identified important information likely to be useful in clinical settings as well as subsequent research with this high-risk population. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AB  - Components of problem-based education, such as small group teaching, are being implemented in diverse health curricula. Implementation, however, is often motivated by the intuitive appeal of many problem-based learning components, when what is needed is the detailed examination of how these components support students' integration of knowledge as well as continuity of their learning experiences. This study presents an investigation of the relationship between lecture and small group teaching (SGT) in a medical curriculum. Four problem-oriented SGT sessions representing diverse topics in the first-year curriculum and their corresponding lectures were videotaped and analyzed using techniques of concept mapping, where the broad concepts from the lectures were identified and matched to the case-specific concepts in the small group sessions. The results show that lectures function as an anchor for the students' discussion of issues relevant to clinical problem-solving and interventions in small group sessions. These discussions extended to contextual aspects of clinical practice that were not dealt with in the lectures, such as ethical/cultural issues around the treatment of patients. Furthermore, small group environments were found to promote discussions that allowed the integration of information from different sources and encompassed concepts across a number of disciplines. These results suggest that carefully designed small group sessions serve the purposes of 1) illustrating broader concepts in lectures to case-specific, clinically relevant problem-solving and 2) promoting knowledge integration from diverse sources of information. The implications of these results for learning and reasoning in health science curricula are discussed.

AB  - Qualitative concept maps are useful for sharing the structure of a domain and for assessing students' understanding. While concept maps made from links and nodes depict static causal relationships between concepts quite well, they provide little support for displaying conditional logic and thresholds for causation. In this paper, we describe the process of incorporating a representation for conditional reasoning into Betty, a computer agent students teach via concept maps. Betty helps students formalize their knowledge of a domain by acting as a novice learner. Students use Betty to construct and assess their knowledge of science topics. We tested several prototypes combining conditional logic with concept maps and found that people had difficulty keeping conditional states and conceptual nodes separate. In the end, the Unless Switch provided the closest semantic parallel to the type of reasoning we wanted students to learn and generated the least amount of confusion.

AB  - For achieving the adaptive learning, a predefined concept map of a course is often used to provide adaptive learning guidance for learners. However, it is difficult and time consuming to create the concept map of a course. Thus, how to automatically create a concept map of a course becomes an interesting issue. In this paper, we propose a Two-Phase Concept Map Construction (TP-CMC) approach to automatically construct the concept map by learners' historical testing records. Phase 1 is used to preprocess the testing records. We apply Fuzzy Set Theory to transform the numeric testing records of learners into symbolic, apply Education Theory (Item Analysis for Norm-Referencing) to further refine it, and apply Data Mining approach to find its grade fuzzy association rules. Then, in Phase 2, based upon our observation in real learning situation, we use multiple rule types to further analyze the mined rules and then propose a heuristic algorithm to automatically construct the concept map. Finally, the Redundancy and Circularity of the concept map constructed are also evaluated.

AB  - This paper reports on the study undertaken to elucidate the effectiveness of web-based concept mapping in the delivery of online courses. The web-based learning environment with concept mapping (WCM) for the online delivery of the first year undergraduate Physics course was specially developed. The effectiveness of this concept mapping was examined by comparing the students' (N=189) achievement in the web pages with and without concept mapping (WOCM). A student t-test analysis (p<0.05) yielded a superior academic performance among students who constructed concept mapping as the learning progressed as opposed to those who did not utilise concept mapping. The cognitive processes in sorting out the learning materials and, organising and establishing the hierarchy of ideas would be discussed, in particular, pertaining to the facilitation of higher order thinking leading to the observed superior performance. © 2006 IEEE.

AB  - Pre-prepared concept maps that organise knowledge in a non-linear fashion appeal to a variety of cognitive learning styles and may thus represent an educational tool that supports 'teaching to all types'. However, another central cognitive factor, learning approach, may have a bearing on student take-up of this learning resource. Student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps introduced in Stage 2 MPharm and BSc Pharmacology lectures were therefore examined in relation to the principal learning orientations according to Duff's 30-item revised approaches to study inventory (RASI). Approximately one half of students (49.6 ± 4.5%) reported pre-prepared concept maps to be useful to their learning (n = 121). When preferred learning approach was examined, derived from the highest RASI score per individual and excluding ties, 31.9 ± 4.3%, 29.3 ± 4.2% and 38.8 ± 4.5% of students demonstrated a preference for the deep approach (DA), strategic approach (STA) and surface approach (SUA), respectively (P > 0.05, χ2 goodness-of-fit test, n = 116). There was a weak but statistically significant association between preferred learning approach identified by Duff's 30-item RASI and the self-reported usefulness of concept maps (P > 0.05, χ2 test of independence; Cramer's V=0.235; lambda=0.193). In contrast, gender was not significantly associated with attitude to concept maps i n this student cohort. A preliminary analysis of standardised residuals based on observed and expected frequencies revealed that the greatest contributions to this significant association were: A positive influence of DA and a negative influence of STA, respec tively, on attitude to concept maps. These data now indicate a contribution of the principal learning orientations vis-à-vis student attitudes to pre-prepared concept maps when employed alongside more traditional teaching/learning activities in medical and bi omedical science education, and may further suggest a role for concept maps in the support of deep learning. © 2006 Taylor & Francis.

AB  - Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student-generated visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle school science concept learning. In a post-test-only-control-group design, scores were compared among a control-group (n=28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper (n=30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers (n=34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post-test than the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group's scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups indicating that visualization might interact with learner characteristics.

AB  - In the past three decades, there have been enormous advances in our understanding of the nature of knowledge and the processes by which humans construct new knowledge. There is now general agreement that knowledge is a human creation, where new ideas are constructed by creative people on the basis of their existing concepts and theories and of a search for new patterns or regularities in events or objects they observe. The constructed nature of knowledge means also that knowledge in every domain continues to evolve over time. We see concepts as the fundamental building blocks of knowledge, and we define concepts as perceived regularities or patterns in events or objects, or records of events or objects, designated by a label, usually a word. There have been even greater advances in our understanding of human learning in the past three decades. These advances have focused on the importance of learners’ prior knowledge for the acquisition of new knowledge and on the need to sequence instruction to build upon the learners’ existing concepts and propositions. It is also recognized that each learner must construct her/his own concepts and propositions and that this process can be most productive when the learner consciously seeks to integrate new concepts and propositions into her/his cognitive structure, a process that requires meaningful learning, in contrast to the rote learning or memorization so common in school learning. Since 1963, our work has been based on the cognitive psychology of David Ausubel, including the design of the audio-tutorial lessons used in a 12-year longitudinal study of children’s science concept learning and the development of a tool we call a concept map to represent knowledge organized into cognitive structures. It has been possible to show explicitly the progressive growth in children’s understanding of science concepts and propositions over time, and in some cases, the lack of such growth. Concept maps have subsequently been used to help students learn how to learn, to capture and archive expert knowledge, and to facilitate creative production. We have also shown that the learning capabilities of young children have been grossly underestimated, especially for “abstract” concepts about the nature of matter and energy (see, e.g., the recommendations for national science standards; National Research Council, 1996). In the past decade, there has been the incredible development of the Internet to share information on virtually any topic. Moreover, enormously increased computer power, transmission band width, and other technological advances now make it possible to provide to any learner almost anywhere in the world all of the information needed to gain mastery of any subject. We are currently seeking ways to exploit these potentials, especially with the use of new concept-mapping software, to help teachers and students ‘scaffold’ their learning, using expert concept maps and the collaborative possibilities of the new technologies. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The National Science Digital Library (NSDL), launched in December 2002, is emerging as a center of innovation in digital libraries as applied to education. As a part of this extensive project, the GetSmart system was created to apply knowledge management techniques in a learning environment. The design of the system is based on an analysis of learning theory and the information search process. Its key notion is the integration of search tools and curriculum support with concept mapping. More than 100 students at the University of Arizona and Virginia Tech used the system in the fall of 2002. A database of more than one thousand student-prepared concept maps has been collected with more than forty thousand relationships expressed in semantic, graphical, node-link representations. Preliminary analysis of the collected data is revealing interesting knowledge representation patterns. © 2003 IEEE.

AB  - This chapter identifies some ideas, including cautionary notes, on assessment that should be considered by those interested in translating school science standards into measures that can be used by classroom teachers and others to assess student understanding of science concepts and the nature of science itself. In school science, one of the difficulties of equating understanding to problem solving is to know when a problem is really a problem, rather than a recall-of-algorithm exercise for a given student. Conceptual understanding in science involves more than algorithmic expertise. The main assumption behind concept mapping as an assessment tool is that expertise or understanding can be assessed by asking a person to construct a map by relating concepts in a hierarchical structure using propositional statements such as is regulated by and results in as the links or connections. Problem solving and concept mapping represent important kinds of tests or assessment tools for judging how well someone understands science concepts. Each tool seems to tap an important feature of what it means to understand, although it is clear that problem solving is seen by most scientists and members of Nobel Prize committees as the ultimate test. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - Project Gutenburg, the Million Book Project, the Networked Digital Library of Theses and Dissertations, Amazon's book search service, and the recently announced collaboration of Google and leading libraries, all aim to make available large numbers of book-length objects, in a variety of languages. Traditional approaches to discovering a suitable book for a particular purpose have generally relied on catalog records, sometimes enhanced with abstracts. Full-text searching popular, e.g., with legal and government documents - and passage retrieval techniques, suitable for encyclopedias and reference works, have not been adequately tested with large collections of large objects. We demonstrate an alternative approach, integrating visualization, text mining, and simple machine translation techniques. We show how electronic theses and dissertations (ETDs), in both English and Spanish, can be summarized as concept maps, according to three different design layouts: whole document maps, chapter-level maps, and table of contents-based maps. Our initial experiments are in the computer science and industrial systems engineering fields. Concept maps (see Figure 1) are "graphical representations of knowledge that are comprised of concepts and the relationships between them" [4]. Concept maps allow students to acquire knowledge more quickly than usual [2], However, concept maps have yet to be extensively researched as aids to knowledge discovery. Our demonstration will show how this can work, including for multi-lingual collections. We argue that 1) users can more quickly grasp the key ideas of a work from a concept map than from an abstract alone; 2) it is easier to automatically generate concept maps than good abstracts; and 3) it is easier to automatically translate concept maps than abstracts. We have tested several methods of finding relations in the texts, such as association rules [1], t-scores, Pearson's χ2. Dice's coefficient, and mutual information. Using part-of-speech information from MontyTagger [3], we can find noun phrases which appear as nodes in the maps. Other parts-of-speech, usually verbs or prepositions, are used as the links between the nodes. Our demonstration highlights these techniques.

AB  - These studies Identified key concepts and developmental differences in people's conceptions of the engineering design process. The method of assessment was concept mapping. Key concepts were derived from the concept maps of 15 experts and organized into six broad categories. Expert data served as benchmarks for assessing the conceptual development of 32 undergraduates who constructed individual maps at the beginning and end of a year-long design course. In general, students' conceptions tended to be more narrow, with consistently fewer references to larger societal issues such as ethics and marketing. Over time the expert-student gap closed regarding knowledge of the design process and the motivations underlying a design (e.g. customer need, scientific need). Findings suggest that an important difference between experts and students is that experts are more likely to situate the design process in a sociocultural context. © 2005 TEMPUS Publications.

AB  - This experimental study explore how 60 primary-age children's (9-11 years old) understanding of rocks was effected by instruction that used the conceptual structure of the rock cycle together with the analogy of aluminium can recycling. Using a combination of probes into children's understanding, including concept maps and semi-structured interviews, changes to the content of their knowledge (description and classification of rocks) as categorized by membership of particular hierarchical explanatory frameworks (constructed from children's preintervention responses), and how such knowledge appears be organized into possible networks of information, are described. Results are then discussed in terms of the impact of the rock cycle, with or without the use of the analogy, on children's existing conceptions, followed by observations on the positive role of the analogy in supporting understanding. In conclusion, the implications for the nature of cognitive change in this domain as revealed by children's explanatory frameworks and the potential value of the aluminium can analogy in supporting children's understanding are addressed. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - This paper describes the methods and outcomes of a 12-year longitudinal study into the effects of an early intervention program, while reflecting back on changes that have occurred in approaches to research, learning and instruction since the preliminary inception stages of the study in the mid 1960s. We began the study to challenge the prevailing consensus at the time that primary school children were either preoperational or concrete operational in their cognitive development and they could not learn abstract concepts. Our early research, based on Ausubelian theory, suggested otherwise. The paper describes the development and implementation of a Grade 1-2 audio tutorial science instructional sequence, and the subsequent tracing over 12 years, of the children's conceptual understandings in science compared to a matched control group. During the study the concept map was developed as a new tool to trace children's conceptual development. We found that students in the instruction group far outperformed their non-instructed counterparts, and this difference increased as they progressed through middle and high school. The data clearly support the earlier introduction of science instruction on basic science concepts, such as the particulate nature of matter, energy and energy transformations. The data suggest that national curriculum standards for science grossly underestimate the learning capabilities of primary-grade children. The study has helped to lay a foundation for guided instruction using computers and concept mapping that may help both teachers and students become more proficient in understanding science. © Springer 2005.

AB  - Problem Based Learning (PBL) and Concept Mapping (CM) have parallel purposes, both based on a constructivist view of learning. In a Faculty of Medicine, PBL and CM have been applied together as the main learning modes. This provided an opportunity to test several hypotheses about the interaction of CM and PBL. Among them were: (i) Students using CMs for their study and revision would perform better on their assessment tasks, than those who did not. This was supported, but not strongly, (ii) Students with 'good' maps would do better than those with 'poor' maps. This was not supported. Many students with apparently 'poor' maps treated them as a sufficient set of keys to unlock very large databases and these students did well. Other students with 'poor' maps confessed to having a tenuous grip on their work and this accounted for the quality of their maps. This raises problems about using maps for assessment purposes. It may be that maps should be treated as very personal learning tools for the writer's eyes only, analogous to a personal diary which could be easily misunderstood by a reader. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.

AB  - A computational framework has been developed for the construction and evaluation of metabolic pathways given input substrates and knowledge of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Application of the framework creates new and existing routes to both chemicals known to exist in biological systems and chemicals novel to biological systems. In the present application, we focus on biosynthetic routes to 7-carboxyindole, a specialty chemical currently produced by organic synthesis, using chorismate as a starting compound and the enzyme actions native to the biosynthetic route from chorismate to tryptophyan. Graph theory and its associated algorithms are exploited to represent molecules and perform enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Through repetitive application of the set of operators representing the enzymatic reactions of interest to the reactants and their progeny, reaction pathways are generated automatically. The concept of generalized enzyme function is introduced and defined as the third-level enzyme function (EC i.j.k) according to the four-digit transformations of the enzyme classification system (EC i.j.k.l). This concept maps enzyme-catalyzed reactions to transformations of functional groups and enables the generation of novel species and pathways. Thermodynamic properties are calculated using a group contribution method "on-the-fly" in order to provide one assessment of the relative feasibility of the novel pathways. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - This paper argues for the integration of metacognitive thinking into the content of school science. It describes the 'metacognitive instances' approach of implanting metacognitive activities, such as classroom discussions, annotated drawing, keeping diary-like notes and concept-mapping, at selected points of the teaching procedure, in an attempt to extend the durability of children's science understanding, which is often short-lived. The approach was tested with 60 Year 5 pupils in Cyprus studying 'Current Electricity', following a quasi-experimental design with one experimental and one comparative group. Following the teaching of the unit, participants were tested on their understanding of electricity three times in one school year. The research showed that the practice of metacognition is feasible with primary school pupils and that children who experienced situated metacognition retained taught concepts for a longer period of time. Although no significant difference was recorded initially in the amount of subject matter learned by the two groups, children who engaged in metacognitive activities appeared to have achieved more permanent re-structuring of their understandings.

AB  - Aims. This paper reports a study examining the effects of adopting concept mapping in problem-based learning scenario discussions on the improvement of students' learning outcomes in a nursing course. Background. Students in Taiwan usually have a high degree of anxiety about whether or not they have learned enough. Problem-based learning is a method of teaching that uses a patient situation or scenario to stimulate students to acquire and apply information to solve problems. Concept mapping can promote problem-solving and critical thinking to help students organize complex patient data, process complex relationships and offer holistic care to patients. Methods. An experimental design was used, with participants randomly assigned either to a control or experimental group. The experimental group participated in six problem-based learning scenario discussions during the 16-week semester, while the control group attended a traditional course. Results. The experimental group had significantly higher proposition and hierarchy scores for their concept maps compared with the control group. There were no significant differences in the cross-link and example scores between the two groups. In general, the total score difference between the groups did not reach statistical significance levels. Only one student in the experimental group obtained a high score; most participants in both groups (over 50%) obtained low scores. Conclusions. Concept mapping strategies may be useful for analysis of individual student's thinking processes for (1) emphasizing key concepts or main ideas, (2) understanding relationships between different concepts, including cause-effect and part-whole relationships, (3) reviewing propositions, hierarchies and cross-links in a logically scientific way, and (4) revising concept structures to agree with theory and experience.

AB  - Faculty efforts to measure outcomes in study abroad programs typically fall short of current expectations for measurable results and increased competencies. Part of the problem stems from the dual challenge of conducting rigorous, objective assessment of these programs without losing the rich, subjective meaning of the cultural experience for student growth and development. The concept mapping method developed by Trochim is a potentially powerful tool for overcoming this challenge, allowing evaluators to utilize qualitative and quantitative research designs simultaneously. This paper illustrates the use of the method in an American social work study abroad program based in Mexico. © 2006, The Board of Social Work Education.

AB  - We examine the equivalence of two construct-a-concept-map techniques: construct-a-map with created linking phrases (C), and construct-a-map with selected linking phrases (S). The former places few constraints on the respondent and has been considered the gold standard; the latter is cost and time efficient. Both their products and processes are compared quantitatively and qualitatively as to total accuracy score, individual proposition scores, proposition choice, map structure complexity, proposition generation rate, and proposition generation procedures. We conclude that the two mapping techniques are not equivalent: The C technique is better than the S technique in capturing students' partial knowledge, even though the S can be scored more efficiently than C. Based on their characteristics, if used as an assessment tool, the C technique is more suitable for formative assessment while the S technique is a better fit for large-scale assessments. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The University of South Alabama has for an extended period of time been committed to improving the introductory programming course for Computer Science. These efforts and their results have been supported by the National Science Foundation, assessed by numerous instruments, and have been disseminated in papers, workshops, and conference sessions. Specific topics of this dissemination have included the integration of lecture and laboratory experiences, the use of motivational strategies and affective objectives, student achievement and retention, the early use of professional practices in the curriculum, the development of student affect during the introductory course, the enhancement of laboratory experiences, the application of various learning theories in the classroom, and curriculum design. In contrast to these prior works which each focused on just a few specific issues, the purpose of this paper is to holistically discuss the set of effective strategies used in our introductory programming course and show how these diverse efforts can be melded together and jointly enhance and enliven the course. This set of strategies includes the integration of cognitive and affective course objectives; the use of concept maps and other visual instructional techniques and tools; the use of motivational strategies such as classroom discussion and student self-reflection; the integration of conceptual development and hands-on exercises in the classroom; the designing of course progress to match the students' zone of proximal development; the designing of course delivery methodologies to match the diversity of students' interests and learning styles; the inclusion of diverse strategies to integrate the "real world" into every component of the course; the strategic use of student surveys; and the integration of professional practices and student commitments to quality. A marked, consistent, and significant increase in student course completion rates has accompanied our implementation of these strategies. © 2005 IEEE.

AB  - Contemporary assessment practices in science education have undergone significant changes in recent decades, The basis for these changes and the resulting new assessment practices are the subject of this two-part paper. Part 1 considers the basis of assessment that, more than 25 years ago, was driven by the assumptions of decomposability and decontextualization of knowledge, resulting in a low-inference testing system, often described as "traditional." This assessment model was replaced not on account of direct criticism, but rather on account of a larger revolution-the change from behavioral to cognitive psychology, developments in the philosophy of science, and the rise of constructivism. Most notably, the study of the active cognitive processes of the individual resulted in a major emphasis on context in learning and assessment. These changes gave rise to the development of various contextual assessment methodologies in science education, for example, concept mapping assessment, performance assessment, and portfolio assessment. In Part 2, the literature relating to the assessment methods identified in Part 1 is reviewed, revealing that there is not much research that supports their validity and reliability. However, encouraging new work on selected-response tests is forming the basis for reconsideration of past criticisms of this technique. Despite the major developments in contextual assessment methodologies in science education, two important questions remain unanswered, namely, whether grades can be considered as genuine numeric quantities and whether the individual student is the appropriate unit of assessment in public accountability. Given these issues and the requirement for science assessment to satisfy the goals of the individual, the classroom, and the society, tentative recommendations are put forward addressing these parallel needs in the assessment of science learning. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals.

AB  - Over the last several decades, many poultry science programs have merged with other departments, but the poultry industry has undergone tremendous expansion worldwide, leading to a growing instructional void with regard to poultry production information. The objective of this project was to address the demand for information by developing two Web-based poultry production courses that cover management of broilers, turkeys, breeders, and layers. The Internet was chosen as the platform because it is asynchronous and may be accessed from any connected site around the world. To be effective, web-based courseware must be theoretically grounded and interactive, but university-level web-based distance education courses often fail to meet these standards. During courseware development, the impact of instructional techniques and technologies on interactivity and learning outcomes was explored. A content expert, an instructional designer, and a graphic artist carefully reviewed a variety of instructional techniques to increase interactivity. Concept mapping was chosen because it has been shown to be a superior learning tool for enhancing the exchange of ideas and knowledge between instructors, students, and content. A unique instructional interface was established that includes threaded e-mail discussion, thought questions, animation, hypertext, rollover interactions, video clips, and concept mapping exercises. Results indicate that the integration of concept mapping into web-based learning environments successfully increased interactivity and learning outcomes.

AB  - Aim. The aim of this paper is to stimulate interest in the practical classroom application of concept mapping strategies as an approach that teachers can easily use to enhance collaborative learning. Background. Concept mapping has been developed as a tool to support meaningful learning. However, much of the research literature fails to explain how concept maps might be most gainfully employed within the classroom. As a result, concept mapping is a tool that is under-used. Methods. Students on a postgraduate teacher preparation programme for nurses were arranged in triads on the basis of the morphology of individually-produced concept maps for the topics of 'genetics' and 'pathogenic microbes'. They were arranged in heterogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'pathogenic microbes', and then in homogeneous triads to produce a consensus map for 'genetics'. The number of acceptable propositions found in their individual maps was compared with the number found in the consensus group maps, and gain scores were calculated for each participant. Findings. Participants arranged in triads of individuals having very different knowledge structures were found to make a greater improvement than those arranged in triads composed of individuals with qualitatively similar knowledge structures. Conclusions. The study was undertaken with a very small sample and only looked at two topic areas. However, the findings support the idea that collaborative groups work most effectively when individuals within the group bring different perspectives to a problem, and that this perspective can be usefully identified within the classroom environment as variations in concept map morphology. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

AB  - We carried out an experiment to determine whether student learning gains in a large, traditionally taught, upper-division lecture course in developmental biology could be increased by partially changing to a more interactive classroom format. In two successive semesters, we presented the same course syllabus using different teaching styles: in fall 2003, the traditional lecture format; and in spring 2004, decreased lecturing and addition of student participation and cooperative problem solving during class time, including frequent in-class assessment of understanding. We used performance on pretests and posttests, and on homework problems to estimate and compare student learning gains between the two semesters. Our results indicated significantly higher learning gains and better conceptual understanding in the more interactive course. To assess reproducibility of these effects, we repeated the interactive course in spring 2005 with similar results. Our findings parallel results of similar teaching-style comparisons made in other disciplines. On the basis of this evidence, we propose a general model for teaching large biology courses that incorporates interactive engagement and cooperative work in place of some lecturing, while retaining course content by demanding greater student responsibility for learning outside of class. © 2005 by The American Society for Cell Biology.

AB  - This study investigated group interaction processes in network supported collaborative concept mapping and the influence these group interaction processes had upon group concept mapping performance. A total of 36 in-service teachers and pre-service student teachers engaged in this study. It was found that group concept mapping performance was significantly correlated to the quantity of group interaction, particularly complex co-operation interaction. Suggestions for a further improvement in the system design to support collaborative concept mapping are also provided in this paper. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Within a sociocultural context, this study examined how science teachers' knowledge of science and science pedagogy changed as a result of participating in a constructivist-based graduate science methods course. Fourteen elementary and middle school science teachers worked with an assigned partner for the duration of the course. Teachers with more than 5 years' experience were paired with teachers who had 5 or fewer years' experience. Results from pre- and postinstruction concept maps, journals, portfolios, and transcripts of discourse revealed that within the zone of proximal development, peers, teachers' students, instructors, readings, and tools mediated the development of content and pedagogical knowledge. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - A naturalistic study, with two cycles of intervention, was carried out to investigate the effects of two methods of introducing concept mapping to students taking introductory subjects in genetics in an Australian university. Some of these students' views relating to concept mapping were also investigated in the years following its introduction. The results of this study suggest that the method of introduction can influence students' perception of concept mapping, and its potential benefit. Although most students taking introductory subjects had taken part in the project, and many had realised the benefits of concept mapping, retrospective views of students indicated that almost none had adopted it as a regular part of study strategies. This outcome raises several questions in regard to introducing learning tools to students and, in particular, the reasons for doing so. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

AB  - The dual role of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in global atmospheric change, and the related feedbacks between ozone-layer depletion and greenhouse warming, reflect the complexity of climate-change issues. Science instruction that targets such issues can make a vital contribution to global scientific literacy from an Earth-systems perspective. This study focused on global atmospheric change instruction for eighth-grade students. Pre-instructional interviews revealed that over 60 percent of students had little to no understanding of CFCs; about 30 percent connected them to ozone-layer destruction, and a few had misconceptions about the ozone hole heating up earth. An analysis of students' post-instructional concept maps suggested that knowledge about CFCs was limited to their role in ozone-layer depletion. Post-instructional interview transcripts corroborated these findings and revealed further that about 30 percent held the misconception that CFCs cause global warming by depleting the ozone layer and letting in more ultraviolet rays or sunlight. These findings suggest that instruction on the role of CFCs in global atmospheric change needs to clarify further the differences between infrared and ultraviolet radiation and might emphasize the greenhouse nature of CFCs prior to dealing with their role in ozone-layer depletion.

AB  - Quantitative concept mapping, in contrast with qualitative approaches, is rigorous scientifically and permits statistical analyses of data about concept learning. This study extends past quantitative research on the structure of student concept learning in pulmonary physiology. Pathfinder scaling is used to derive concept maps for medical and veterinary students and their physiology instructors at Northwestern University and the University of Wisconsin, respectively. The concept maps are evaluated for coherence (internal consistency), student-instructor similarity, and correlation of similarity with final examination scores. Results show that student and instructor concept maps are coherent and that student concept maps become increasingly similar to instructors' concept maps from pre- to postinstruction, but that student-instructor concept map similarity does not correlate with examination performance. Research outcomes are discussed concerning possible sources of variation in student and faculty knowledge structures.

AB  - This cross-age study explored the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge about and attitudes toward sharks, and the relationships among knowledge and attitudes. Responses were elicited from a convenience sample of students (5th, 8th and 11th grade, and college level) and senior citizens (n = 238). All subjects constructed a concept map on sharks and responded to a Likert-type attitude inventory. Based on the work of Novak and Gowin (Leaning How to Learn, Cambridge University Press, 1984), concept maps were scored for frequencies of non-redundant concepts and scientifically valid relationships, levels of hierarchy, incidence of branching and number of crosslinks. The attitude inventory, emerging from Kellert's (The Value of Life: Biological Diversity and Human Society, Island Press, 1996) work, generated subscale scores on four affective dimensions: scientific, naturalistic, moralistic and utilitarian/negative. Significant differences were found among subject groups on all knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. Gender differences were documented on three of four attitude subscales. A series of simple, mulitiple and canonical correlations revealed moderately strong relationships between knowledge structure variables and attitudinal dimensions. The pattern of these relationships supports conservation education efforts and instructional practices that encourage meaningful learning, knowledge restructuring and conceptual change (Mintzes et al., Assessing Science Understanding: A Human Constructivist View, Academic Press, 2000).

AB  - Saint Vincent College,. An essential component of the problem solving process is the mastery and the use of a knowledge base within a specific discipline. Unfortunately, students often approach this as primarily a memorization task, rather than developing the depth of understanding necessary for effective problem solving. Several Classroom Assessment techniques were utilized in an undergraduate biochemistry class to assist students in developing a better sense of how they were learning course material and to indicate to the instructor where students were having difficulties. These techniques can be used for eL wide variety of topics and only take a few minutes of class time. The thI:ee techniques chosen were the One Sentence Summary (summarizing large amount of information), the Detining Features Matrix (categorizing information according to a given set of defining features), and the Concept Map (connections between concepts). Examples of each of these techniques and how they were integrated into the biochemistry course at Saint Vincent will be presented.

AB  - After an instructor has used a Web-based forum in a course for years, the system database will contain an accumulation of discussion messages, which may be on similar topics, from different classes within a course. Furthermore, the discussion processes of some classes may be very heuristic for other learners in the same course. In general, a Web-based forum serves as additional channels for learners to discuss learning topics in the absence of an instructor. However, an instructor may want to guide learners in reading meaningful discussion messages in previous learners' discussion records when a similar question is asked. Hence, it is necessary to model the relationships between discussion messages from different classes in the same course. Furthermore, an instructor desires no unanswered question, called a dangling question, in a Web-based forum because of the possible negative influences, such as discouraging learners to raise questions. This paper proposes a conceptmapping method, which originates from information retrieval technology, for representing the relationships between learners' questions and previous learners' discussion messages. Consequently, the methodology enables an instructor to locate easily from the system database a set of discussion messages with conceptual similarity as answers to eliminate the dangling question. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Increasing availability of technologies, such as CD ROMs and the World Wide Web, in schools means that more teachers will have the potential to implement student-centred, inquiry-based approaches to learning. Assessing what each student knows in a broad subject area, such as science, is difficult. Assessing students’ understanding in circumstances where each student may pursue different topics of study, where there is no way to predict in advance what those topics of study will be and where the possible topics of study include natural phenomena which are only beginning to be studied by professional scientists, is even more difficult. The authors recently faced such a challenge. To meet the challenge, the authors chose to assess student learning using an open-ended concept map activity combined with a rubric which extracts quantitative information about the quality of understanding from each map. This article describes the method the authors developed, including tests of reliability and validity. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - This paper puts forth a vision and a possible architecture for a community knowledge evolution system. We propose augmenting a multimedia document repository (digital library) with innovative knowledge evolution support, including computer-mediated communications, community process support, decision support, advanced hypermedia features, and conceptual knowledge structures. These tools and the techniques developed around them would enable members of a virtual community to learn from, contribute to, and collectively build upon the community's knowledge and improve many member tasks. The resulting Collaborative Knowledge Evolution Support System (CKESS) would provide an enhanced digital library infrastructure serving as an ever-evolving repository of the community's knowledge, which members would actively use in everyday tasks and regularly update.

AB  - This paper describes a qualitative approach 10 analysing students' concept maps. The classification highlights three major patterns which are referred to as 'spoke', 'chain' and 'net' structures. Examples are given from Year 8 science classes. The patterns are interpreted as being indicators of progressive levels of understanding. It is proposed that identification of these differences may help the classroom teacher to focus teaching for more effective learning and may be used as a basis for structuring groups in collaborative settings. This approach to analysing concept maps is of value because it suggests teaching approaches that help students integrate new knowledge and build upon their existing naïve concepts. We also refer to the teacher's scheme of work and to the National Curriculum for science in order to consider their influence in the construction of understanding. These ideas have been deliberately offered for early publication to encourage debate and generate feedback. Further work is in progress to better understand how students with different conceptual structures can be most appropriately helped to achieve learning development.

AB  - This paper puts forth a vision and an architecture for a community knowledge evolution system. We propose augmenting a multimedia document repository (digital library) with innovative knowledge evolution support, including computer-mediated communications, community process support, decision support, advanced hypermedia features, and conceptual knowledge structures. These tools, and the techniques developed around them, would enable members of a virtual community to learn from, contribute to, and collectively build upon the community's knowledge and improve many member tasks. The resulting Collaborative Knowledge Evolution Support System (CKESS) would provide an enhanced digital library infrastructure serving as an ever-evolving repository of the community's knowledge, which members would actively use in everyday tasks and regularly update.

AB  - This paper investigates one particular contribution of hypertext to knowledge construction: the transition from declarative knowledge to structural knowledge. The proposed model hypothesizes that the navigational structure of hypertext provides a framework to the learner for integrating new information with previously acquired knowledge and should hence facilitate the acquisition of structural knowledge. The results of an empirical study designed to compare the effect of hypertext on the construction of structural knowledge, as measured by concept maps, to that of linear text (both hard and soft) support the predictions of the model. The implications of these results on the design of the hypertext navigational structure are discussed.

AB  - This study investigates to what extent collaborative knowledge construction can be fostered by providing students with visualization tools as structural support. Students (32) of Educational Psychology took part in the study. The students were subdivided into dyads and asked to solve a case problem of their learning domain under one of two conditions: (1) with content-specific visualization; (2) with content-unspecific visualization. Results show that by being provided with a content-specific visualization tool, both the process and the outcome of the cooperative effort improved. More specifically, dyads under that condition referred to more adequate concepts, risked more conflicts, and were more successful in integrating prior knowledge into the collaborative solution. Moreover, those learning partners had a more similar individual learning outcome. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study investigated the role of talk and writing on learning science. The purpose was to explore the effect of talk, writing, and talk and writing on the learning and retention of simple and integrated knowledge, and to describe the mechanisms by which talk and writing mediate these processes. Forty-three students were randomly assigned to four groups, all stratified for gender and ability. At intervals during an instructional unit, three treatment groups received problem tasks that involved constructing scientific explanations for real-world applications of ecological concepts. A control group received simpler descriptive tasks based on similar content. Students in the talk-only treatment group (T) discussed the problem tasks in small peer groups. Students in the writing-only treatment group (W) individually wrote responses for each of the tasks, but without first talking to other students. Students in the combined talk and writing treatment group (TW) discussed the problems in groups prior to individually writing their explanations. Dependent variables included simple, integrated, and total knowledge scores based on multiple-choice tests, essay questions, and concept maps obtained at three timepoints during the study: a pretest; an immediate posttest; and a delayed posttest. Records of student talk and writing were also analyzed to describe the mechanisms involved. The findings suggest that talk is important for sharing, clarifying, and distributing knowledge among peers, while asking questions, hypothesizing, explaining, and formulating ideas together are all important mechanisms during peer discussions. Analytical writing is an important tool for transforming rudimentary ideas into knowledge that is more coherent and structured. Furthermore, talk combined with writing appears to enhance the retention of science learning over time. Moreover, gender and ability may be important mediating variables that determine the effectiveness of talk and writing for enhancing learning. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Sci Ed 84:566-593, 2000.

AB  - This study used concept map content analysis and interviews to gain insights into the knowledge organisation and knowledge processing of pre-service teachers. Forty-eight preservice teachers of elementary science from a teachers' training college in Sarawak, Malaysia, participated in this study. Correlations between achievement and five concept map characteristics showed that there were significant positive correlations (p < .01) between achievement and: the number of appropriate links; the average number of appropriate concepts per cluster; and, the hierarchy score of subjects' concept maps, and significant negative correlations (p < .01) between achievement and: the number of inappropriate links; and, the average number of inappropriate concepts per cluster. Interviews with high-achievers and low-achievers revealed that there were differences in the way they processed knowledge during concept mapping. The high-achievers were more thorough than were the low-achievers in cognitive processing of knowledge, taking time to make sense of concepts, son and group concepts, form relevant links between concepts, and organise concepts hierarchically. Active cognitive processing of knowledge seems to be related to more complex, well-integrated cognitive structures for the material learned.

AB  - This follow-up study explored successive and progressive changes in the structural complexity and propositional validity of knowledge held by students enrolled in an advanced, undergraduate, university- level biology course. To examine the way learners restructure their knowledge during the semester, subjects constructed concept maps at intervals of four-six weeks. The concept maps were scored for structural complexity and propositional validity based on a modified version of Novak and Gowin’s methods, and for structural change based on the work of Rumelhart and Norman. Results support previous findings that a significant amount of ‘weak’ knowledge restructuring occurs, resulting in an incremental, cumulative and limited form of conceptual change. However, the most ‘radical’ type of ‘strong’ restructuring (involving wholesale, abrupt and extensive change) is concentrated during the first six weeks of the course. The findings also suggest that gender plays a significant mediating effect in knowledge restructuring. Significant differences favouring females were found in the number of crosslinks depicted and a significant interaction, also favouring females, was found in the amount of branching. Finally, clinical interviews with rote and meaningful learners suggest that the latter group displays an enhanced level of awareness, and a stronger ability to monitor, regulate and control their own learning. The significance of these findings for research and practice are discussed. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - Integrated science teaching is a task which requires that teachers develop new conceptual structures for the science topics they teach. It is often assumed that changes in teaching can be facilitated through reflective practices such as teacher self-assessment. Does self- assessment in fact help teachers develop new conceptual structures in the context of integrated science? We examine this assumption in the research reported in this paper. In the German PING project - an integrated science project for middle schools - teacher in-service education was based on collaborative workshops in which a group of 22 teachers from different types of schools used teaching materials for eight integrated topics for their lesson planning and conducting units over a period of 30 months. During this time concept maps, interviews and questionnaires were used as means to promote teacher self-assessment. We find that this kind of self-assessment in a collaborative framework was a useful basis for helping science teachers develop integrated conceptual structures and we suggest that in-service courses might use self-assessment for reflection on conceptual content knowledge as a basis for supporting integrated science teaching.

AB  - This study examines the extent to which science education graduate students enjoy a well-articulated position on the compatibility of science and religion and, as a result, are comfortable with their espoused views and plans for the role of religion in science classroom discussions. We were particularly interested in examining changes in student mental states as a legitimate form of conceptual change after a course intervention. This might be evidenced by the depth of understanding, level of reasoning, and degree of comfort with classroom application. The intervention first asked students to write a "talk back to the author" paper shortly after reading a provocative essay on the topic. This was followed by reading and discussing a variety of alternative views after which they wrote a more formal position paper on the science-religion topic. We first conducted a content analysis of both papers, developing separate concept maps of the overall class response in the first and second papers, noting changes in emphases. Adapting a current multidimensional model of conceptual change, we then developed an individual evaluation form based on categories that emerged in the class analysis, which were strikingly similar to the categories in the multidimensional model. These included ontological, epistemological, and social/affective dimensions of conceptual change. Both papers were scored in these three areas. The conceptual change for each student from talk-back to position paper was subsequently reported using individual graphs and citing text examples. Results showed conceptual change or improved mental state in all three categories for most students. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Sci Ed 84:445-468, 2000.

AB  - We studied the occurrence and nature of learning in a university first year Introduction to Geomorphology course, and its relations with prior knowledge taught in a prerequisite course, and with the prior knowledge in the to be learned subjects. Ten dimensions of knowledge were tapped before and after the course by conventional and cognitive structure measures that were derived by the concept mapping methodology. The fine-grain analysis of learning outcomes yielded the following results: (a) students acquired only a small portion of the content in the course Introduction to Geomorphology, (b) the prior geological and geomorphological knowledge did not affect the learning of the new geomorphological contents, (c) the minor effects appeared within rather than across knowledge dimensions, and they affected mainly the learning of smaller knowledge units, and (d) concept definition cannot be considered a valid probe of knowledge. The differential effects of prior knowledge question the central, global and undifferentiated role that schema theories ascribe to prior knowledge in future learning. They call for greater reference to the exposed dimensions of knowledge by suggesting additional factors to be considered in the sequencing of courses, as well as to the acquisition of complex knowledge with partial meaning of the basic knowledge units, and the use of new cognitive structure probes of knowledge.

AB  - We examined the implementation of a laser-disk based science curriculum in an elementary school. The goal was to develop a richer understanding of the principles for designing a curriculum that will adequately support teachers in adopting a learner-centered framework. Issues included: who has ownership of the classroom discussion; what types of activities are engaged in terms of the constraints imposed; and what is the teacher's response to the specific tools provided (the teacher's guide, the Circle of Learning, and concept maps). In addition to looking at the implementation pattern, we also examined the impact of the implementation on student attitudes and anxiety toward science. Results indicated little adoption of the curriculum, and teachers continued to maintain a high degree of control in the classroom. However, results also indicated significant effects of the curriculum on science attitude and. anxiety. Suggestions for future research are included. © 1997 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - Concept mapping is described repeatedly in the literature as a tool that can support and enhance students' learning in science classrooms. Despite such endorsements, the use of concept mapping as a basis for classroom activities in UK secondary schools does not seem to be widespread. Some of the flaws in the supporting literature are highlighted. The two main barriers to the extensive adoption of concept mapping as an integral component of typical classroom strategies are seen as the epistemological beliefs of classroom teachers and the underlying philosophy of the curriculum that they are asked to deliver. In conclusion, concept mapping is seen as a tool that may support learning within an appropriate teaching ecology. Such an ecological perspective may require, for some, a re-conceptualization of the teacher's role in which teaching, learning and change are seen as integrated components of effective teaching.

AB  - This study explores the effectiveness of concept mapping, the learning cycle, expository instruction, and a combination of concept mapping/learning cycle in promoting conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis. Four high school biology classes were taught diffusion and osmosis concepts with the aforementioned treatments. Conceptual understanding was assessed immediately and seven weeks after instruction with the Diffusion and Osmosis Diagnostic Test (DODT). The results indicated the concept mapping/learning cycle and concept mapping treatment groups significantly outperformed the expository treatment group in conceptual understanding of diffusion and osmosis. There was no significant difference among the learning cycle group and other treatments. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Two instructional methods (teacher centered and student centered) were compared in a non-laboratory-based environmental science course for college undergraduates. Students in 2 teacher-centered (traditional) classes (n = 46 and n = 45) were presented material in standard lecture fashion for 90 min twice a week. Students in 2 student-centered (constructivist) classes (n = 48 and n = 42) worked in small, heterogeneous groups on thought-provoking scenarios and critical thinking questions or constructed concept maps on the information of the day; material was presented to the students in question-discussion fashion. Identical materials, learning resources, student questionnaires, and examinations were used for both populations. Students in constructivist classes performed significantly better on exams, rated the course higher, and participated more in campus and regional environmental support efforts than students in traditional classes. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to (a) describe how concept mapping can be used as an integral instructional strategy for teaching a college course on evolution, (b) evaluate the utility of incorporating concept mapping in a college course on evolution, (c) determine whether students' concept maps reveal "critical junctures" in learning as the course unfolds, and (d) assess the impact of concept mapping of students' study practices and on students' understanding of course content. Key findings include: (a) Critical junctures in learning evolution can be identified by monitoring the degree of concordance can superordinate concepts appearing on the class set of concept maps submitted after each of the course lectures; (b) students who made concept maps reported spending an average of 37% more study time of this college biology course than on their previous biology courses; and (c) the use of "seed concepts," "micromapping," a standard concept map format, and a standard concept map checklist made the strategy feasible for the instructor to implement and for the student to adopt. A concept map performance index formulas was also developed for this research study in order to assess students' overall mapping performance.

AB  - The use of student-constructed concept maps in assessment is congruent with the changing emphases set forth by the National Science Education Standards. Authorities have expressed concern about concept map scoring systems and their associated validity and reliability. They favor methods that employ expert/criterion maps as referents and emphasize the use of accurate concept relationships in deriving scores, which have been found to correlate with performance on standardized tests. In this study, student constructed concept maps (n= 17) that emerged from post-instructional interviews about chlorofluorocarbons were scored against a teacher-expert map using a scheme weighted for relationships. Interrater reliability for the scoring scheme was high (r=.959). Students' map scores correlated highly with their scores on the California Achievement Test component total (r=.729) and moderately with their Pathfinder index (r=.474), the latter believed to be an excellent measure of structural knowledge. A revised map score, derived only from relationships containing one or more of the concepts employed in Pathfinder analysis, was a statistically significant (p=.031) predictor of the Pathfinder index. The findings of this study support the recommendations of others to use expert referents and emphasize concept relationships in assessing concept maps. 2002 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - The present study was conducted to investigate the contribution of conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction to 10th— grade students' understanding of the human circulatory system. To determine misconceptions concerning the human circulatory system, 10 eleventh-grade students were interviewed. In the light of the findings obtained from student interviews and related literature, the Human Circulatory System Concepts Test was developed. The data were obtained from 26 students in the experimental group taught with the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping, and 23 students in the control group taught with the traditional instruction. Besides treatment, previous learning in biology and science process skills were other independent variables involved in this study. Multiple Regression Correlation analysis revealed that science process skill, the treatment, and previous learning in biology each made a statistically significant contribution to the variation in students' understanding of the human circulatory system. It was found that the conceptual change texts accompanied by concept mapping instruction produced a positive effect on students' understanding of concepts. The mean scores of experimental and control groups showed that students in the experimental group performed better with respect to the human circulatory system. Item analysis was carried out to determine and compare the proportion of correct responses and misconceptions of students in both groups. The average percent of correct responses of the experimental group was 59.8%, and that of the control group was 51.6% after treatment. 2001 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - This paper reports on a qualitative appraisal of the ability of first-year engineering students to engage in a metacognitive process about their learning strategies. At the beginning of the semester, texts on learning strategies, reading, concept mapping, emotional competencies, change and stress were distributed to each student and discussed in the classroom. We emphasized the importance for students not only to monitor their performance during the semester but also to look back on their learning strategies and, if necessary, to improve them. To that end, we asked students to periodically write in a personal learning journal their thoughts about their learning strategies. As an incentive, we told them that, as one of their final exams, they would have to write a 7 to 10-page essay about their learning strategies. They were also informed that they would be graded according to their ability to analyse their strategies, whether these strategies were optimal or not. Results of a preliminary analysis of these essays confirm that it is possible to bring first-year engineeering students to reflect on their learning strategies.

AB  - Changing a surgical wound dressing is a traditional nursing task that incorporates many areas of nursing knowledge. This article describes the construction of a concept map to sort the subjective, objective and constructed knowledge required to perform this task with optimal wound healing the goal. Critical thinking is used to select and exclude information. The use of concept maps as a tool to synthesise knowledge is discussed as is how the chosen concept incorporates the art and science of nursing care. The concept map displays the wholistic assessment of the client and use of nursing knowledge to determine and promote wound healing.

AB  - Traditional tests are not effective tools for diagnosing the content and structure of students' knowledge of physics. As a possible alternative, a set of term-association tasks (the ConMap tasks) was developed to probe the interconnections within students' store of conceptual knowledge. The tasks have students respond spontaneously to a term or problem or topic area with a sequence of associated terms; the response terms and time-of-entry data are captured. The tasks were tried on introductory physics students, and preliminary investigations show that the tasks are capable of eliciting information about the stucture of their knowledge. Specifically, data gathered through the tasks is similar to that produced by a hand-drawn concept map task, has measures that correlate with in-class exam performance, and is sensitive to learning produced by topic coverage in class. Although the results are preliminary and only suggestive, the tasks warrant further study as student-knowledge assessment instruments and sources of experimental data for cognitive modeling efforts. © 2002 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - There is increasing evidence that libraries, traditional and digital, must support learning, especially the acquisition and enhancement of scientific reasoning skills. This paper discusses how classificatory structures, such as a faceted thesaurus, can be enhanced for novice science learning. Physical geography is used as the domain discipline, and the Alexandria Digital Earth Prototype project provides the test bed for instructional materials and user analyses. The use of concept maps and topic maps for developing digital learning spaces is briefly discussed.

AB  - In this study of fifth-grade students, we examined the relationships and development of communities of concepts related to heat and convection. The study involved five classes of fifth-grade students who worked with a partner for a series of heat and convection laboratory investigations. Students' knowledge was assessed before and after instruction through the use of a written test, concept maps, card sort tasks, and interviews. During instruction each dyad was audiorecorded and observed by a field researcher. The patterns and connections among students' conceptual ecologies related to heat and convection as well as the types of schemas that were accessed preceding and subsequent to instruction are described. The types of knowledge elicited by each type of assessment are identified. Findings include the influence of familial and cultural experiences (such as airplanes, weather patterns, and religious beliefs) on conceptual development, as well as the extent to which competing phenomena (evaporation and dissolving) have on the development of new conceptual understandings. The study also found that each assessment measure elicited different types of knowledge. Concept maps were effective in describing students' existing schemas related to heat prior to instruction. Multidimensional scaling and the card sorting task provided information on students' conceptual organization for clusters of concepts. The interviews and dyad discourse transcripts were most effective in revealing the processes and prior knowledge that students used as they interpreted new observations in light of preexisting experiences. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons.

AB  - A novel method is described for analysing concept maps for research and analysis purposes. The coding system rates the use, the stability, and the complexity of each link, which is a unique way of representing students’ knowledge. The analysis scheme affords a look at how students may integrate new knowledge into their existing structures and may be used for assessment purposes or research on how students learn. This coding system was successfully applied to a sample of 56 complex concept maps that had been generated from student interviews on the topic of chemical bonding. The coding system is of particular use when analysing complex concept maps with a large number of concept nodes and links. The system described here was also particularly useful for assessing complex, non-hierarchical concept maps. © 2001 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - In this article we present the results of an experimental study of the influence of task characteristics on the characteristics of elaboration of conceptual knowledge in social interaction. With a pre-test and post-test we measured individual learning outcomes. We constructed a coding scheme that focuses on the communicative functions and propositional content of utterances and on elaborative episodes. The subjects were 40 students who worked in dyads on a collaborative task about electricity in one of four conditions. We compared a concept mapping task with a poster task and investigated the effect of a phase of individual preparation. The post-test scores were significantly higher than the pre-test scores. Individual preparation created better learning results and the asking of more questions. The concept mapping conditions showed more discussion of electricity concepts, collaboratively elaborated conflicts and reasoning, but no higher individual learning outcomes. In the concept mapping conditions, elaboration was related to individual learning outcomes. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Low-achieving seventh-grade students from an urban parochial school were randomly assigned to two equally sized groups (n = 62, each group). One group was taught by a read-and-discuss, teacher-directed method, and the second group, given the same type of introductory lesson as the first, followed a model of concept mapping that connected major and minor concept ideas. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a science chapter served as the dependent variable. Prior to any teaching, a pretest was administered. An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate showed a statistically significant difference in comprehension between the pretest and posttest for the experimental group. Effect size estimates revealed that concept mapping can be expected to improve comprehension scores of low-achieving seventh graders by approximately six standard deviations over a traditional instructional technique. When students lack background information on a topic to aid comprehension, the active participation in constructing semantic or concept maps may help students form a cognitive schema to assimilate and relate the new topic information.

AB  - The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of use of the concept mapping technique in the learning of science subjects by Arab students in a preparatory school second grade, located in the Gaza Strip. Concept mapping is a schematic device for representing a set of concept meanings embedded in a framework of propositions. The subjects of this study were randomly assigned to the two regularly scheduled classes, and each class was assigned to either experimental or control conditions. In the control class, the teaching approach was primarily teacher orientated, that is the teacher used the lecturing method in sequencing the instructional activities. In the case of the experimental class, the concept mapping approach added the generation of propositional relationships among concepts on maps, using the same content material. The results of this study indicated that the experimental class subjects achieved better than those of the control class.

AB  - The article sets the context in which primary science educators find themselves, following the publication in England and Wales of the two recent DfEE circulars (10/97 and 4/98), Teaching: High Status, High Standards. The implications of trainee teachers demonstrating a wide range of standards, both of teaching ability and personal subject knowledge levels, by the end of their courses, are considered. The research was carried out by questioning staff from 32 teacher training institutions, who attended a conference in the early summer of 1998, where the focus was looking at strategies for auditing and enhancing trainee teachers’ subject knowledge. The results indicated that few institutions had foreseen the changes by previously planning for the introduction of subject auditing of trainees, but that all institutions had plans afoot for introducing it both on entry, and during the course. Techniques were based mainly around student self-assessment, monitored by tutors, using strategies such as evidence portfolios, concept mapping, etc. Strategies such as multiple-choice testing and computer assessment were envisaged as being used to a lesser extent. © 1999, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Concept mapping has been applied in a variety of fields, including instruction, learning, curriculum development, and assessment. Because many empirical studies have proven the validity of concept mapping, a computer-based concept mapping system has been developed. The system provides two learning environments. In the "construct-by-self" environment, the system provides students with the evaluation results and corresponding hints for feedback. The students construct concept maps by themselves with only the assistance of the feedback. In the "construct-on-scaffold" environment, in addition to the feedback, the students receive an incomplete concept map, within which some nodes and links were set as blanks for the scaffold. A study comparing the effectiveness of the "construct-by-self", "construct-on-scaffold", and "construct by paper-and-pencil" concept mapping showed that the "construct-on-scaffold" had better effect for learning on biology. Both of the two computer-based procedures are helpful for students in completing their concept maps.

AB  - The study reported in this paper developed and evaluated a web-based concept map testing system for science students. Thirty-eight Taiwanese high school students were involved and it was found that their performance on the system was not significantly related to their achievement as measured by traditional standard tests. Their views about the use of the system, in general, were positive. An analysis of students' future use of the system and their motivation and learning strategies revealed that those with more critical thinking metacognitive activities and an effort regulation management strategy showed more willingness to use the online testing system. Moreover, students with high test anxiety showed a preference to be tested through the system.

AB  - Based on the fast growing technologies to allow students to explore and experience three-dimensional worlds, the question becomes relevant if and how technology offers essentially new dimensions to the learning process. In a number of prototypes this paper demonstrates how learners may undergo immersive experiences that complement the predominantly verbal expositions how complex realities like the many-facetted processes in living creatures work. Based upon the model of a mammal's heart, pre- and postsynaptic processing and finally the apprehension of cultural signs on migration, identity, culture and communication, this paper aims at provoking the discussion in how far we may already rely on visual semiotics that may complement traditional learning material and further stimulate the further evolution into perceptual learning. Based on experiments into the relation between cognitive style (holistic versus serialistic) and various memory capacities, the thesis is brought forward that we need to explore further the various concept-mapping techniques, both for the designer and the user of educational learning environments. © 2000 IEEE. © 2000 IEEE.

AB  - The cross-disciplinary context of density and slope was used to compare the conceptual organization of students in an integrated algebra and physical science class (SAM9) with that of students in a discipline-specific physical science class (PSO). Analyses of students' concept maps indicated that the SAM9 students used a greater number of procedural linkages to connect mathematics and science concepts on the SAM9 students' maps than did the PSO students. The maps produced by SAM9 students also tended to show a more compartmentalized approach to thinking about the content of the two disciplines, a finding contrary to the researcher's original assertion. Traditional teaching territories and conceptual complexity were examined as possible explanations for the discrepancy between the predicted and actual outcomes. 1998 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - The American College of Women's Health Physicians has been exploring an on-line educational tool - concept mapping - to facilitate the development of an interdisciplinary and woman-centered women's health curriculum, and to implement The Women's Health Care Competencies for Medical Students. By using an on-line concept map of the menstrual cycle, we have built upon a standard piece of curricula that describes a unique aspect of female physiology and transformed it into a knowledge framework that builds capacity. The concept map highlights relationships between concepts and across disciplines, connecting the competencies to enable meaningful learning so that a learner can adapt their knowledge to multiple settings, incorporate new learning, and generate new knowledge to grow the interdisciplinary field of women's health. The on-line format allows access from multiple sites and courses, and allows the curricula to grow organically over time without upsetting current curricular design.

AB  - Integration of field experiences and hands-on laboratory exercises have been demonstrated to be effective teaching methods in the sciences. The geosciences, in particular, depend heavily on field investigations. In this study, a multi-week laboratory sequence was developed and assessed as to its effectiveness in enhancing student learning in a hydrogeology course. The laboratory sequence strives to integrate field and laboratory exercises into a cohesive unit that illustrates the physical and hydraulic properties of aquifers, and to develop links between hydrogeology and related undergraduate courses in the Earth and environmental sciences. Assessment of student learning showed a positive effect of the lab as demonstrated by concept mapping comparisons and performance on test questions.

AB  - At the confluence of the DesPlaines, Kankakee and Illinois rivers is the Prairie Parklands Macrosite, an area of approximately 40,000 undeveloped acres that includes the DesPlaines and Heidecke Lake State Fish and Wildlife areas, Goose Lake Prairie State Natural Area, corporate lands owned by Commonwealth Edison, General Electric, Mobile Oil, Amoco, Stepan and Dow Chemical and the former Joliet Army Ammunition Plant. The ammunition plant, also known as the Joliet Arsenal, was one of 77 built nationwide between 1940-43 to supply ammunition for the United States and its allies. At its peak during World War II it produced 5.5 million tons of TNT per week, with production ceasing shortly after the Vietnam War. On May 30, 1995, the commission unanimously approved a concept map that called for the arsenal to be divided as follows: two industrial parks totaling 3,000 acres; a 982-acre national veterans cemetery; a 455-acre landfill; and a 19,023-acre tallgrass prairie. The four purposes spelled out in the legislation are: to manage the land and water resources in a manner that will conserve and enhance the native populations and habitats of fish, wildlife and plants; to provide opportunities for scientific, environmental and land-use education and research; to allow the continuation of agricultural uses for 20 years; and to provide a variety of recreational opportunities that are not inconsistent with the first three purposes.

AB  - Task-related variance causes scores from performance assessments not to be generalizable and thus inappropriate for high stakes use. It is possible that task-related variance is due, in part, to students’ inability to transfer their knowledge consistently from one assessment task to another. Therefore, concept-mapping, a cognitive tool, might be useful to aid this transfer. This study examines the effects of concept maps on the task-related variance components of Political Science performance assessments. On three quizzes, some students used concept maps while writing two essays, while other students did not. The task variance components remained unchanged across groups, but the person main effect components increased and the task-by-person interaction components decreased for those using concept maps. Also, the scores from the concept mapping groups had higher generalizability coefficients than for those who did not use a concept map. © 2000, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We reviewed the process of using concept mapping as a methodology to teach science to RNs in a bachelor degree of nursing program in Australia. METHOD: The technique was used for two classes of students in the science unit during 1995 with work packages and independent student learning being the focus of the unit. RESULTS: Both instructors and students found the experience mainly positive. It helped the students become more independent learners, have a greater confidence in their knowledge of science, and allowed their understanding of science in their practice to become more meaningful and personalized. For the instructors it allowed them to concentrate on students with learning difficulties because they had less face-to-face teaching hours. Major issues arising from the process related to how to balance science content and the techniques of concept mapping and how to more effectively assess the learning outcomes of the students. CONCLUSION: Concept mapping is a useful technique to link science and nursing practice. Not only can it be used in academic programs to teach the science underlying practice, it can be used in the clinical area to teach patients. As a technique it works well in staff development and continuing education where the focus is on elucidating the rationale for inuring practice and providing evidence for the value of this practice.

AB  - The traditional teaching of physics in separate domains leads to a fragmented knowledge structure that has an adverse effect on the comprehension and recall of the central ideas. We describe a new program: MAOF ("overview" in Hebrew), which relates large parts of mechanics and electromagnetism to each other via the key concepts of field and potential, and at the same time treats students' conceptual difficulties. The MAOF program can accompany any conventional course in mechanics and electromagnetism as part of the review process. The instructional model integrates problem solving, conceptual understanding, and the construction of a knowledge structure. It consists of five stages: solve, reflect, conceptualize, apply, and link. In order to construct the relationships within a domain, students solve simple and familiar problems, reflect on their solution methods, identify the underlying principles, and represent them in visual form, forming concept maps. Additional activities deal with conceptual difficulties and application of the information represented in the concept map. The maps are constructed at different levels of detail and are applied in further problem solving. Students who studied with MAOF significantly improved their understanding of central ideas associated with fields and potentials. They improved their understanding of the relationship between general concepts and their examples, and could better solve familiar and unfamiliar problems using these concepts. © 2000 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - Educational research findings suggest that instructors can foster the growth of thinking skills and promote science literacy by incorporating active learning strategies into the classroom. Active learning occurs when instructors build learner participation into classes. Learning in large, general education Earth Science classes was evaluated using formative assessment exercises conducted by students in groups. Bloom's taxonomy of cognitive development was used as a guide to identify critical thinking skills (comprehension, application, analysis, synthesis, evaluation) that could be linked to specific assessment methods such as conceptests, Venn diagrams, image analysis, concept maps, open-ended questions, and evaluation rubrics. Two instructors conducted a series of analyses on sample classes taught with traditional lecture and inquiry-based learning methods. Qualitative and quantitative analyses show that such methods are preferred by students, improve student retention, produce no decrease in content knowledge, promote deeper understanding of course material, and increase logical thinking skills.

AB  - The problem addressed by this study is that first-year college chemistry students learn little of the conceptual material associated with chemistry experiments they perform. The thesis of this research is that the construction of prelab and postlab concept maps help students understand the concepts involved in the experiments they perform. The study was conducted using 32 non-science majors enrolled in a first-year chemistry course. The experimental group constructed prelab and postlab concept maps, while the control group wrote essays explaining the conceptual chemistry of the four experiments used in this study. Both groups took 25-item achievement tests 1 week after each experiment. Prelab and postlab concept maps were scored and evaluated for significant differences. Five students were interviewed to investigate their perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in chemistry laboratories. No significant differences were found between treatment groups with respect to students' conceptual understanding as determined by the multiple choice achievement tests. Students responded very positively toward the use of concepts maps in the laboratory. They felt strongly that constructing prelab and postlab concept maps helped them understand the conceptual chemistry of the experiments. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This study evaluated concept maps spontaneously constructed by applicants (N = 502) in a medical school entrance examination. In all, 36 maps were produced. Concept maps were evaluated for content of relevant terms and for the number of interrelationships indicated. The aim was to determine whether including relevant ideas on a concept map is related to the learning of those ideas. Because concept maps are effective tools for making the structure of knowledge explicit, it was hypothesized that the quality and content of spontaneously made maps would be related to improvement in the comprehension of text material. Understanding was assessed in terms of success in essay-type tasks designed to measure the ability to define, explain, and apply statistical knowledge. The results indicated that merely including the relevant concepts in a map has little effect on the comprehension of those concepts, whereas the extent and complexity of concept maps plays a powerful role in the understanding of scientific texts. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Ltd.

AB  - Presentation of content in hyperlinked multimedia formats for teaching has failed using the computer's power of navigation through rich visual and auditory information. We have developed 'Information Frames', an authoring tool in hypertext markup language (html) format, that allows easy utilization by technology-challenged teachers and professors, and attracts students because of interactive, design-based learning. An Information Frame contains a definition, explanation and illustration of a single concept. Topics are provided with hyperlinks to other Information Frames having related concepts that may provide prerequisite knowledge, or may raise the concept to a more integrative level. A graphical view of the linked Information Frames presents a Concept Map of the overall topic.

AB  - Multiple intelligences (MI) theory (Gardner, 1983), a pluralistic conception of intelligence, has been adopted by educators in a variety of ways to improve teaching and learning. Some adaptations have included exploring learning styles, designing lesson plans, developing integrated curricula, and adopting authentic forms of assessment.In this case study, a high school science teacher, Jade (a pseudonym), explored MI theory and used it as a conceptual framework to make decisions about how to structure her Grade 9 science curriculum. In studying the case, a variety of data sources and methods were used, including audiotaped planning meetings and interviews, classroom observations, teacher‐generated concept maps, and reflective journals.This article describes Jade's initial explorations of the theory, how she incorporated the theory into her daily teaching, and the outcomes of the study for Jade and her students. In addition, tensions and challenges experienced by Jade in applying the theory to practice and the implications for science teaching and learning are discussed. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Research into learning in informal settings such as museums has been in a formative state during the past decade, and much of that research has been descriptive and lacking a theory base. In this article, it is proposed that the human constructivist view of learning can guide research and assist the interpretation of research data because it recognizes an individual's prior knowledge and active involvement in knowledge construction during a museum visit. This proposal is supported by reference to the findings of a previously reported interpretive case study, which included concept mapping and semistructured interviews, of the knowledge transformations of three Year 7 students who had participated in a class visit to a science museum and associated postvisit activities. The findings from that study are shown in this report to be consistent with the human constructivist view of learning in that for all three students, learning was found to be at times incremental and at other times to involve substantial restructuring of knowledge. Thus, we regard that the human constructivist view of learning has much merit and utility for researchers investigating the development of knowledge and understanding emergent from experiences in informal settings. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for teachers and staff of museums and similar institutions are also discussed.

AB  - Student learning in complex fields such as physical science can be difficult to assess. Performance assessment techniques offer an alternative way of approaching this goal. This paper addresses the use of concept mapping as a means of assessing changes in the way students grasp the conceptual structure of specific topics in physical science. A concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the student's organisation of concepts and, indirectly, the student's construction of meaning. Therefore, concept mapping has the potential to provide direct measures of students' knowledge structures. Various concept mapping techniques are reviewed based on their validity and reliability when used as a means of assessing student learning. The educational implications of adopting concept mapping performance assessment strategies are also discussed along with directions for future research.

AB  - In this paper, a 2 X 2 factorial design was used to assess the main and interaction effects of GSS and facilitation on knowledge restructuring under experimental conditions. To measure knowledge restructuring, the concept mapping technique and similarity coefficient were used to evaluate the level of restructuring of individual structural knowledge (complexity and integration) and the commonality of individual knowledge among the group. Results of the experiment indicated that both GSS and facilitation were effective cognitive tools which could be used to enhance knowledge restructuring. Supplemental analysis revealed that the presence of either GSS or content facilitation improved quality of learners' feedback which was an important factor needed to heighten restructuring of learners' mental models. However the interaction effects of GSS and facilitation on knowledge restructuring were found to be non-additive. © 2000 IEEE

AB  - The primary purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of two different types of interviews - one that did (POSTICM) and one that did not (POSTI) embed a concept-mapping process - to elicit students' postinstructional understandings about chlorofluorocarbons and their role in global atmospheric change (GAC). A chief criterion measure was accordance, the degree to which students held the ideal postinstructional understanding set forth in a teacher-expert concept map. After GAC instruction that included concept-mapping activities, 34 eighth-grade science students were assigned randomly to groups and completed either POSTICM or POSTI. These students and their teacher also completed relatedness ratings of central concepts from the teacher-expert map. The Knowledge Network Organizing Tool™ was used to transform relatedness ratings to Pathfinder networks and compare nets to yield a student to teacher similarity index (Pathfinder index). Regression analysis revealed that type of interview did not predict accordance. However, most POSTICM students perceived the concept-mapping interview component to be helpful and affect positively their answers to the interview questions. The Pathfinder index did predict (p = .003) accordance - the Pathfinder index was a reliable confirmatory measure of the degree to which students held the ideal postinstructional understanding.

AB  - Compositional (post-coordinated) terminologies are one potential solution to the problem of content completeness. However, they have the potential to render data incomparable. For computers to determine that compositional expressions are comparable, the relations between the composed components that are understood implicitly by human readers must be represented explicitly for computer manipulation. We discuss a technique for discovering and formalizing the implicit semantic relationships in two vocabularies: the International Classification of Disease Version 9 Clinical Modification (ICD9-CM), and SNOMED-Reference Terminology (SNOMED-RT). The results of this technique are used to augment the existing SNOMED-RT relation ontology [1], which is a necessary step in automated concept mapping between systems. The reference terminology must contain all the semantics implicit in the classification in order to map concepts between the two representations. We also provide an explicit representation of the implied semantics of ICD9-CM. This tabulation will be useful for other knowledge engineering efforts involving ICD9-CM. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA). All rights reserved.

AB  - Conceptual understanding is the ability to apply knowledge across a variety of instances or circumstances. Several strategies can be used to teach and assess concepts, e.g., inquiry, exposition, analogies, mnemonics, imagery, concept maps, and concept questions. This paper focuses on the last two - concept maps and concept questions. Concept maps are two-dimensional, hierarchical diagrams that show the structure of knowledge within a discipline. Concept questions are questions posed to students to encourage higher order thinking and help them understand the basic principles of a discipline. This paper describes current progress at MIT in the development and use of concept maps and concept questions in aerospace engineering.

AB  - Research traditions in education and information retrieval have grown up in parallel worlds, although they share a theoretical foundation that profoundly influences research methodology and best practice in their respective domains. They also share a common problem: the need for a method for analyzing sparse, quantifiable data collected in qualitative studies with small sample sizes. This paper explores the theory of expected information, which uses formulas derived from the Fano measure (1961) and Bayesian statistics (1764), and demonstrates its application in a study on the effects of concept mapping on the searching behavior of tenth-grade biology students.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of incorporating concept mapping into computer assisted instruction (CAI). Ninety-one tenth-grade students in Singapore participated in the study, in which they were randomly assigned to three groups. In the Partial Map group, partial concept maps were used in the program and the students were asked to construct concept maps after reviewing each topic; in the Complete Map group, complete concept maps were provided; and in the Menu-Selection group, traditional menu-selection interface was used. The Complete Map group and Menu-Selection group performed note-taking activities instead of concept mapping activity. It was found that students in the Partial Map group performed significantly better than the other two groups on a chemistry achievement test and significantly better than the Menu-Selection group on a concept mapping test. The results suggest that assigning students with a concept mapping activity accompanying a CAI tutorial program is a plausible method to enhance their learning.

AB  - This research investigates the use of patterns in designing adaptable, flexible hypermedia applications. While patterns are particularly applicable to software design, they can also be used to assist designers of other types of applications. We have developed a method (APHID) that guides a hypermedia creator through the analysis and design process. The method ensures that good design principles are followed, both for the hypermedia application and for the interface that presents the hypermedia application. Our method uses a concept map, constraints, and patterns (instructional and presentation) to support partial automation for creating hypermedia applications. We also present a prototype software system that uses the APHID method to create instructional hypermedia applications semi-automatically. The applications created using APHID are tailored to specific types of learners. We conclude with a claim that this approach is applicable not just to instructional hypermedia, but to the larger problem of generating adaptable interfaces. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

AB  - This research evaluates the effects of a scaffolded explanation-based approach to collaborative discussion on students' understanding of photosynthesis. This approach consists of instruction and prompts encouraging students to engage in the processes of explaining and justifying one's personal knowledge and comparing it to scientific knowledge. Forty-eight 4th- and 5th-grade students, identified as having high or average "intentional" approaches to learning, were divided into 3 groups (high, average control [AC], and average intervention [AI]). Students worked both collaboratively and individually on 2 reasoning tasks (problem-explanation and concept maps) in the domain of photosynthesis. The results of the concept-mapping tasks indicated that the students in the AI group developed a more accurate scientific and functional understanding of photosynthesis than the AC group who did not receive the intervention. This study also confirmed the prediction that the AI group would more closely resemble the high intentional learning group by constructing explanations that were conceptually more advanced as well as retaining and acquiring more subject matter knowledge than those of the AC group. The scaffolded explanation-based intervention did not have a significant effect on the structure of students' explanations. This research supports the importance of the nature of students' discussion (i.e., explanation) to advance their beliefs about scientific phenomena and emphasizes the usefulness of explanation and concept-mapping techniques as evaluative measures of student knowledge during collaborative problem solving.

AB  - The City of Helsinki has decided to improve the planning, design and building of accessible environments. The Accessible Helsinki Programme is designed for all inhabitants, not only for the disabled and elderly. The needs of disabled and elderly people are important, but so too are the needs of both able bodied children and adults, life cycle analysis of construction and of buildings, ecological, economic, cultural and social sustainability. Educational research and development are a facilitating aspect of the Programme to monitor and improve the quality of thinking and acting in the Programme. Educational theories to promote the Programme are presented in this paper. Improved concept mapping as a metacognitive quality tool is introduced. As a pilot study, ten 'experts' and decision makers in the Programme were interviewed and their conceptual frameworks indicating how they understood the Programme and the role of education in it were concept mapped. The results provide a good starting point for shared understanding and further educational research and development in the Programme.

AB  - Across the nation, undergraduate faculty and staff in the sciences are being called upon to examine traditional laboratory practices. The Vee map is a graphic organizer that is a viable alternative to one component of the traditional laboratory, the laboratory report. It consists of a large Vee with six areas: Focus Question, Word List, Concept Map, Events, Data and Data Transformations, and Conclusions and Claims. The Focus Question guides the investigation, while the Word List and Concept Map reveal prior knowledge. The Events area is a description of the plan students devise to answer the Focus Question. The collected data are recorded and analyzed in the Data and Data Transformation area, findings and results of the investigation are described in the Conclusions and Claims area. Students proceed through these areas in the above mentioned sequence as they engage in an open-ended laboratory investigation. As students complete a Vee map, they contemplate their prior knowledge, engage in the process of knowledge construction, and build meaningful knowledge. Ultimately, a Vee map is a tool that assists an instructor in creating a more interactive and student-centered laboratory report.

AB  - The majority of public school teachers do not feel well prepared to use instructional technology. Professional development on computer-based concept mapping responds to this concern through focusing on a tool/software that has many applications and is not difficult to master. A subset (n = 18) of science teachers in a Health Sciences and Technology Academy (HSTA) completed a workshop on electronic concept mapping and were provided with school site licenses and other follow-up support (summer institute). They utilized the software in academic enrichment for underserved students, regular classroom instruction, and inservice training for colleagues. Triangulation of findings from data sources (electronic conferencing, lesson plans, workshop evaluations) revealed that HSTA teachers embrace electronic concept mapping as a versatile educational tool. Factors contributing to this enthusiasm included the ease with which students use the software, the transparent nature of the learning process for these students, and the positive attitudes of colleagues whom they have inserviced. The findings from this project are congruent with what experts contend to be critical features of effective teacher professional development: facilitating a community of learners and providing sustained support. This project now funds software use in over 45 public schools. © 2001 Plenum Publishing Corporation.

AB  - A method used in program evaluation and public health research called concept mapping is examined in this article for its usefulness in feminist research. This method embodies several defining characteristics of feminist social science. Concept mapping is a single method that integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, provides an opportunity for participants to work together as a group to develop an understanding of a concept, and places the participants in control of interpretation. Over the course of a six-step process, a group of people are assembled to discuss an issue or concept, moving toward a group understanding of that concept, which is then represented in a visual picture, or map. Concept mapping was used in the current study to examine how community resources for sexual-assault victims could be improved. A national random sample of 168 rape-victim advocates provided ideas as to how the legal, medical, and mental health systems could better serve victims. A subgroup of advocates then constructed and interpreted a concept map. The map suggested that rape victims still face many problems in seeking community help. Twelve clusters of broad-based and specific system changes were identified (e.g., fighting victim blaming, community education, sensitizing medical staff, legal reform). Implications for research on sexual assault and feminist research methodology are discussed.

AB  - Effective notes taking is an important link to the learning chain. In this paper, we present an Online Notes-taker intended to design and deliver personalized course notes for individual students. The notes contents can be organized based on the user profiles such as learning styles, study plan and assessment result. The characteristics of this approach are to provide better supports to the concept mapping, learning styles, content-based, and interactive learning environment. The system is running on the Internet with XML and SMIL, following an agent-based approach.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of multimedia authoring, as a learning tool, using the software ASTOUND. The subjects in this study were 32 students in two Grade 12 classes. The context of the study was a multi-disciplinary environmental unit about earthquakes. Students were provided with basic background about earthquakes via laboratory experiments and field trips. At a later stage, the students did in-depth independent projects on selected topics related to earthquakes. Once completed, the students presented their projects using the multimedia software ASTOUND. The research consisted of the following stages: a pre-development phase; curriculum design phase; implementation and evaluation. The research tools included: questionnaires, interviews, observations, concept mapping, and an analysis of the multimedia presentations. The findings showed that an integration of laboratory exercises, field trips, and an independent study project, could lead to meaningful learning. However, although most of the students enjoyed using the multimedia program, there was no evidence to support the assumption that it contributed to knowledge acquisition. In fact, much of the time invested in multimedia authoring was devoted to producing decorative effects, reducing the time available for meaningful learning. © 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Student teachers have at their disposal various information sources concerning teaching: their own beliefs, their mentors’ practical knowledge, and ’theory’. Because practical knowledge often remains implicit, the aim of the present study was to explore the appropriateness of two techniques for its articulation: concept mapping and completing sentences. The criterion used was that these should not only elicit descriptions of how to teach, but also the cognitions underlying teaching, i.e., practical knowledge. Thirty-five student teachers and their mentors at a postgraduate teacher-training institute in the Netherlands used both techniques, concerning the subject of ’order’. Subsequently, the students summarized their own beliefs, their mentors’ practical knowledge, and theory and compared these to each other. The student teachers’ reports showed that they, in general, had been able to elicit partially their mentors’ practical knowledge. It was concluded that the use of the techniques involved seemed valuable for student teachers’ learning processes. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - This yearlong study was implemented in seventh-grade life science classes with the students' regular teacher serving as teacher/researcher. In the study, a method of scoring concept maps was developed to assess knowledge and comprehension levels of science achievement. By linking scoring of concept maps to instructional objectives, scores were based upon the correctness of propositions. High correlations between the concept map scores and unit multiple choice tests provided strong evidence of the content validity of the map scores. Similarly, correlations between map scores and state criterion-referenced and national norm-referenced standardized tests were indicators of high concurrent validity. The approach to concept map scoring in the study represents a distinct departure from traditional methods that focus on characteristics such as hierarchy and branching. A large body of research has demonstrated the utility of such methods in the assessment of higher-level learning outcomes. The results of the study suggest that a concept map might be used in assessing declarative and procedural knowledge, both of which have a place in the science classroom. One important implication of these results is that science curriculum and its corresponding assessment need not be dichotomized into knowledge/comprehension versus higher-order outcomes. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - This study assessed the effectiveness of concept maps as learning tools in developing students' conceptual understanding in a freshmen college physics laboratory course, and explored students' perceptions regarding the usefulness of concept maps in the laboratory. The intervention group participants who constructed pre- and post-laboratory concept maps scored substantially higher (on the order of 12 percentage points) on a test that assessed their conceptual understanding of the target physics concepts than participants who did not construct such maps. This difference, however, was not statistically significant. Moreover, the intervention group participants noted that concept mapping helped them to organize their knowledge and prepare for the course experiments, and promoted their understanding of the target physics content.

AB  - Summarized are research findings and policy implications obtained over a 5 year period (51 teachers, 1200 students) from the implementation of an in-depth expanded applications of science (IDEAS) model with average, above average, and at-risk students in grades 2-5. The IDEAS model replaced the time allocated for traditional reading/language arts instruction with a daily 2 hour time-block dedicated solely to in-depth science concept instruction which encompassed reading comprehension and language arts skills (e.g. concept-focused teaching, hands-on activities, utilization of science process skills, reading of science print materials, concept map construction, journal writing). The multi-year results revealed a consistent pattern of the model's effectiveness in improving both the science understanding (effects on the Metropolitan Achievement Test-Science ranged from 0.93 to 1.6 grade equivalents) and reading achievement (effects on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills-Reading and the Stanford Achievement Tests-Reading ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 grade equivalents). Participating students also consistently displayed significantly more positive attitudes and self-confidence toward both science and reading. Interpreting the findings, the IDEAS model was considered to provide clear evidence for the importance of focusing the teaching-learning process on the conceptual structure of the curricular knowledge to be learned in a fashion consistent with research and policy issues raised by the recent TIMSS study. Also discussed was the role of the IDEAS model as a means for linking theoretical perspectives from instructional design and cognitive science to science educational reform. © 2001 Taylor and Francis Ltd.

AB  - Economic constraints, profound changes in the healthcare system and insufficient educational expertise have gripped medical education. The objective of this study was to review professionalization of medical education and to contribute to an elaboration of a conceptual framework for understanding reforms. We developed a concept map based on information retrieved by searching the Medline/Knowledge Finder and the Cochrane Library databases. The descriptors used for the searches were 'certification, credentialing, education, faculty medical, quality assurance health care, research, staff development, teaching'. The endpoints for the study were: frequency, quality of studies and propositional content with regard to professionalization for developing a concept map. Thirty-one relevant studies were found in Medline. The Cochrane Library search returned no relevant studies. The evidence of the few studies was weak. The literature-derived concept map shows that faculty development is a prerequisite for certification leading to professionalization. Other related variables were resource allocation, intrinsic motivation to learn, educational research, study time, financial policy, organizational and staff development, and new specialized roles such as clinician-educator. It is concluded that professionalizsation of medical education is needed. This deficit underscores the need for conceptually sound research approaches. The concept of intrinsic motivation explains how to comply with scientifically based standards, thus fostering professionality. Approaches facilitating compliance, such as evidence-based learning, potentially professionalize the practice of medical education. Novel approaches such as quality management and best evidence medical education could professionalize medical education.

AB  - The ImpacT2 evaluation is using image based concept mapping as one method of exploring the impact of networked technologies on students' learning. In a pre-test administered in June 2000, students in three cohorts aged 10-11, 13-14 and 15-16, produced around 2000 'maps'. Entitled 'Computers in My World', these provide a means of students externalising mental representations of networked technologies. Using a phenomenographic approach, the study aims to identify qualitatively different patterns of thinking and trends in the development of pupils' concepts. Five quanititative measures emerged from heuristic analysis of the maps: nodes, links, connectivity, 'Spheres of Thinking' and 'Zones of Use'. Analysis of the pre-test maps was carried out alongside analysis of pre-test questionnaires, using SPSS. The outcomes suggest correlations between pupils' experience and the constent of their maps. Phenomenographic interviewing of selected 11 year old pupils, which entailed handling control over to interviewees through the use of openended questions, enabled further exploration of their experiences and understandings of those experiences. A method for in-depth interviewing of young students is described. Data suggest that pupils have sophisticated 'secondary artifacts' or mental models of the nature of networked technologies and their role in today's world. This has implications for the way that ICT is used in schools and for its potential as a tool for students' learning. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - This study examined the roles that students' science concepts play in promoting teachers' professional growth. Two cohorts of teachers (N = 26 and 30) participated in the study as part of a constructivist-based graduate course on elementary and middle school science methods. A modified learning cycle was used during course instruction as a framework for teachers to explore sound, light, and electricity. Data on teachers' pedagogical and conceptual growth was obtained from pre-and postconcept maps, journal reflections, and portfolios. Results of the concept map analysis showed that teachers' maps became more integrated and cohesive as seen in the increase of crosslinks, hierarchies, and relationships drawn for each science topic. The journals and portfolios showed that students' science knowledge served as discrepant events that evoked teachers' dissatisfaction with their own content knowledge and motivated them to reconsider their pedagogical practices. Students' concepts also served as change agents, resulting in changes in teachers' views of their roles and instructional behaviors. © 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Inc. Sci Ed 83: 545-557, 1999.

AB  - Concept maps have been used extensively in science education both to promote and to measure meaningful learning. This study examines the use of concept maps to measure tertiary science students' understanding of fundamental concepts in statistical inference. Different methods of scoring maps are examined, and a revised scheme developed. Student scores on concept maps of two aspects of statistics, namely problem definition and statistical inference, are compared before and after a practical statistical investigation conducted by the students. The concept map scores are also compared with marks awarded for the practical assignment. While there was no significant improvement in concept map scores over time, some significant correlations were found between aspects of the concept map scores and scores on the practical assignment. Valuable qualitative information can be gained from an investigation of student concept maps, which enables clarification of student misconceptions, and which cannot be obtained from traditional assessment methods. © 1999 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Major changes are underway in accounting education, in part because of the encouragement of the Accounting Education Change Commission (AECC). To extend learning beyond the formal curriculum, the AECC advocates that accounting educators help students develop the ability to 'learn how to learn.' A learning technique called concept mapping, widely accepted in science education, is described in this paper. Concept mapping allows students to understand how they learn and how new knowledge is constructed. Students can then use this technique to 'learn how to learn' and carry knowledge absorption beyond their college experience. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - With the move towards a learner-oriented, self-paced, asynchronous system for higher and continuing education, the traditional course-based curriculum structure needs to be examined for its efficiency. This article outlines the basic idea of concept mapping and discusses the structure of a concept-module and its relationship to other concept-modules. It also provides some examples of concept modules for RF and microwave circuit design, and highlights advantages of this approach.

AB  - This article describes two related studies that began to explore the validity of scores from select-and-fill-in (SAFI) concept map assessments as measures of students' connected understanding of science. Scores from SAFI maps created for this purpose and used with middle school students and undergraduate astronomy students possessed high internal consistency and exhibited large mean increases with increased domain exposure. SAFI scores were strongly related to scores from a standardized multiple-choice (MC) achievement measure for middle school students; work with individual students suggested that they used strategies requiring connected understanding to successfully complete the maps. SAFI scores from undergraduate students exhibited large relationships with scores from direct-instruction MC exams and scores from a relatedness ratings measure, taken together and separately. Results provide initial evidence of the validity of scores from SAFI maps as measures of connected understanding of science in middle school and undergraduate introductory science students.

AB  - Students can explore quantum mechanics with a concept map that uses only the most elementary solutions to Schrödinger's equation. The content has been slightly modified from the traditional introduction to the subject because the issue of interpretation is postponed until Parseval's theorem is reached and used to postulate two fundamental equations of probability, simultaneously. A set of canonical but approximate equations can describe wavepacket motion for most linear waves. If restricted to certain special cases, these equations of wavepacket motion are easily derived and can serve as a temporary substitute for Ehrenfest's theorem. A number of exercises can be incorporated into this maze of quantum mechanics.

AB  - Computerized problem-based learning (PBL) cases were developed that replicate the critical thinking process undertaken by students during traditional facilitator-led PBL sessions. Eight computerized PBL cases emphasizing medicinal chemistry and pharmaceutics concepts were developed initially from among those used previously during facilitator-led sessions. Two case versions were developed: one incorporating concept maps emphasizing key ideas and another lacking the maps. Quiz scores and attitudes were measured and compared among students using the computerized PBL cases (with and without maps) and the previous year's class who attended only facilitator-led sessions. Scores on the 12 quizzes administered did not differ significantly among the different student groups. Students consistently felt that the PBL sessions improved their problem-solving skills, use of information resources, and communication/interaction skills. Computerized PBL cases can be a useful alternative to facilitator-led sessions to reduce faculty time demands in this process while retaining the benefits.

AB  - This study employed the case study methodology, focusing on three students engaged in a group task. The students were grouped together based on their learning style and cognitive control differences: one student was an Assimilator/Field-Independent; another, a Converger/Field-Mixed; and the third, an Accommodator/Field-Dependent. The group task was to develop a concept map on hypermedia-related concepts. Our research focus was to determine how each of three students influenced the construction of the group concept map with their learning styles and cognitive controls framing our analyses. The data sources used were (1) their individual concept maps which they used during the group task, (2) the group concept map, (3) the transcriptions of the dialogue that took place when completing the group task, (4) their hypermedia knowledge, (5) their hypermedia experience, (6) features they identified as comprising a hypermedia environment, and (7) hypermedia insights. We found that the Assimilator/Field-Independent student was the most influential by having (1) the greatest similarity between her individual concept map and the group map, (2) the highest number of concepts added and the fewest number of concepts omitted, (3) the highest number of hypermedia features that were also included in the group concept map, and (4) the most complex links between concepts. The next influential was the Converger/Field-Mixed. The least influential was the Accommodator/Field-Dependent. Explanations are given from the learning style/cognitive control perspective. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - In an experimental study, we investigated how 10th graders acquire, extend, and successively relate knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects of classical mechanics. The study was made up of 2 main phases. In the 1st phase, students were taught either qualitative or quantitative aspects of classical mechanics by means of 2 different instructional units. In both units, concept maps were used for the presentation of information. In the 2nd phase, dyads were formed with students who worked on different instructional units and thus possessed systematically different knowledge. The 2 students collaboratively worked on problems that were beyond the competence of each of them and demanded the coordinated use of knowledge about qualitative and quantitative aspects. Before and after the instruction as well as after the collaborative problem solving, students had to work on multicomponent tests. In addition, during the collaborative problem solving, protocols were taken of the students' mutual exchange of information. An analysis of the multicomponent tests revealed that qualitative as well as quantitative knowledge can successfully be taught by means of concept maps. Students who initially were taught qualitative aspects of physics gained significantly more from the information provided by their quantitatively instructed partners during the collaborative problem solving than the other way around. An analysis of individual problem-solving attempts uncovered that students learned to construct increasingly more complete qualitative and quantitative problem representations. An explorative protocol analysis of the students' dialogues further indicated that the students gradually shifted their focus from quantitative to qualitative problem representations during collaborative problem solving.

AB  - A qualitative study addressed the effect of concept mapping on the searching behavior of tenth-grade students engaged in research projects based on their instruction in a classroom-based genetics unit. The setting was an automated library of a private American school in Europe. Ten biology students were chosen by purposive sampling. Selection criteria, monitored by user profiles, included student age, computer experience, native language, grades, and test scores. One group used concept mapping, while the other received the same classroom instruction without mapping. Data on searching behavior were collected using think-alouds, interviews, debriefing, and journals. Calculations based on Bayesian statistics and the Fano measure from information theory were triangulated with qualitative analysis of data. While the entire research process, as defined by Kuhlthau's model, was examined to include stages from pre-focus formulation to writing the research paper, this article centers on the information search. Fano's information measures showed there was a greater probability that concept mappers will use print rather than electronic means, that they will search in SIRS rather than the OPAC, and that in electronic searching they will use subject heading rather than keyword. In print, as opposed to electronic searching, measures showed mappers applied a larger number of search terms, employed opening moves, re-formulations, search operations, and relevancy judgments more often and executed more depth than breadth searching. In all cases probability measured at least half a nat (one nat equals 2.718), indicating chances were approaching twice as likely that searchers exhibiting these characteristics in print indexes will be mappers. Larger differences between the groups emerged in electronic searching, where mappers spent less time. Quantitative data verified mappers were more thorough and efficient, reformulating by shifting synonyms and moving from general to specific search terms and terminating searches to read rather than when they depleted their search terms. Stronger focus formulation emerged as the most important determinant of searching behavior. Further research is recommended to replicate the study with a larger sample, using information theory as an alternative to classical statistics in hybrid qualitative-quantitative studies.

AB  - This study involved 20 research participants who created group concept maps on the term "hypermedia." The purpose of the study was to determine whether groups, membership of which was based on a mixture of learning styles or a mixture of hypermedia knowledge, constructed concept maps that differed in terms of number of concepts, number of nodes, number of links, number of bidirectional links, number of multiple concept nodes, number of nodes with multiple links, and varying levels of hierarchical relationships. It was found that the group comprised of two convergers, one assimilator, and one diverger, all of whom had a high level of hypermedia knowledge, was the most productive. Of the 11 measures, they produced the most for 7 of them. We were also interested in determining the interactive dynamics that either learning style or hypermedia knowledge played as the participants constructed their group concept maps. We audiotaped their interactions and categorized their comments and actions within the learning style traits associated with being either a converger, a diverger, an assimilator, or an accommodator. Learning style seemed to explain the types of interactions more than hypermedia knowledge did. © 1997 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Introduction. In conjunction with GPs reporting on their own practice experiences, the experiences of non-GP health professionals and consumer representatives working at the primary care-general practice interface provide valuable considerations for exploring concepts for the development of a GP Integration Index relevant to Australian General Practice. Objectives. To identify concepts that GPs, non-GP health service providers and consumer representatives perceive to be important in facilitating a well integrated approach to delivering primary care, and how these are perceived to be occurring in practice. Method. Group discussions about GP integration were elicited using concept mapping with four groups of GPs and seven groups of health professionals and consumer representatives, purposively selected for diversity in demographic location and practice setting from three Australian States. From Victoria, 19 GPs from two different types of practice settings, 12 Consumer Representatives from 10 separate organisations, 17 Hospital Administrators from 16 major public and private hospitals, 18 specialist doctors representing 12 specialist organisations and 13 Community Service Providers. From Queensland, 13 rural GPs and 22 Nurses representing 10 separate nursing groups were selected. From Western Australia, 19 GPs representing a mix of solo practice, group practice and hospital settings, and 40 Allied Health providers representing various private practitioners and hospital and community centre based allied health practitioners. Concept mapping results from the groups were pooled and analysed using a descriptive meta-matrix to identify overarching themes. Results. Eight overarching themes were identified from consolidated concept maps: GP role; quality outcomes; practice management/accessibility; communication and networks; health care system politics; education and knowledge; personal attributes and attitudes; and lifestyle. Within these major themes, clusters of concepts rated as at least 'important for patient care' included various non-clinical aspects of primary care delivery. There was emphasis on a patient - centred and holistic care approach. Strongly advocated by all groups was the need for teamwork between GPs and other health care professionals involved in primary care of the patient. Conclusion. The use of concept mapping was successful in ensuring that the breadth of the topic was explored in its entirety among these groups, contributing to the identification of the dimensions of the concept of GP-integration. Findings from these groups will be pooled and subjected to structural equation modelling processes, to develop a general practice integration index relevant to the Australian setting. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

AB  - Conducted in Israel, this research probes students' understanding of the relationships between genetic concepts. Four populations were examined: 9th graders (14-15 year olds), who were exposed to genetics for the first time (n = 184); 12th graders (17-18 year olds), who were studying biology as their main subject (n = 121); college pre-service teachers, who had not yet earned a degree (n = 29); and university pre-service teachers, who had earned biology degrees and were seeking teacher certification (n = 22). Three research Instruments were used: a written questionnaire, interviews, and concept maps. The questions were open-ended to enable the identification of students' patterns of comprehensive thinking and understanding, not identifiable In multiple choice testing. Alternative conceptions and compartmentalisation between related concepts were identified. Based on these findings, genetic instruction in 9th and 12th grade and in college needs improvement.

AB  - This study examines differences in conceptual knowledge representations among three groups of students with different levels of study of chemistry. Variation in the structural characteristics of participants' concept maps on the topic of acid-base equilibrium were sought by indirect means. Year 12 secondary chemistry students, undergraduate chemistry majors and honours, masters and doctoral candidates participated in the study. Paired propositional links in the concept maps for the three groups were analysed by the scaling algorithms "Pathfinder" and multidimensional scaling. Results show differences among groups in the structural significance in the networks of abstract process-related nodes and matter-related nodes. Implications for theories of conceptual change are discussed.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine whether the construction of integrated knowledge structures by students can be stimulated by concept mapping and by better visualization of concepts and their interrelationships. The investigation was carried out in regular teaching settings: chemistry courses in secondary schools in Flanders, in the domain of electrochemistry. A significant positive effect of extra attention to visualization on the learning achievement of students was found. However, significant effects of concept mapping as an instruction method could not be detected under the given research conditions.

AB  - The major purpose of this study was to describe a science teacher's views of STS (Science-Technology-Society) instruction and what she acquired after implementing a two-semester STS-oriented science course in a high school of Taiwan. Upon analysis of the teacher's journals, interview data, concept maps, and relevant student questionnaire responses, this study revealed the following findings. The teacher believed that STS instruction was a potential way of practicing so-called "constructivist" teaching and her pedagogical knowledge about STS showed a considerable growth. As a result of STS instruction, her epistemological views of science seemed to progress toward more constructivist-oriented views of science. The heavy content load of Taiwan's national curriculum, regular cross-class standard tests, the lack of peers' or administrative support, the resource limitations in Chinese language, and the cultural impacts were identified as major factors that inhibited her implementation of STS instruction. © 2001 John wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The study examined how features of student interaction, and the way an individual student contributes to that interaction (his or her participation), relates to the improvement of conceptual understanding within the domain of physics. The study also investigated how textbooks are used during collaborative work and how that use affects the quality of student interaction and outcomes. The participants were 56 students aged 15 or 16. The students worked in dyads on a concept-mapping task that functioned as an introduction for a new course about electricity. A condition in which the students were provided with 2 textbooks was compared with a condition without the availability of textbooks. The use of textbooks had a negative influence on the amount of elaboration and coconstruction in the student interaction. Individual learning outcomes were positively related to the amount of collaborative elaboration in the student interaction. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This article illustrates some of the problems faced by student teachers of biology when they try to realize the process of tdidactic transformation’ (Boschhuizen, 1982, p. 200) while planning their classes. This 'didactic transformation’ raises questions of choice, structuring and sequencing. A content structure (Boschhuizen, 1982, p. 200) has been proposed: “the hierarchical concept-mapJoyce & Weil (1980, p. 91) point out the lack of heuristics to draw these hierarchical concept-maps. In cooperation with student teachers, teacher trainers and pupils a method has been developed to draw hierarchical concept-maps. This method has been called a method of subject-matter analysis (Boschhuizen, 1982). This method has been introduced as a component of the curriculum of the teachers’ training course at the Free University in Amsterdam. The problems of testees who realize the process of 'didactic transformation’ following their own cognitive structure with or without making use of the method of subject-matter analysis, have been examined. This research has resulted in a classification of these transformation problems. © 1988, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - This paper describes part of the preliminary data analysis of a research project entitled ‘Emergent Environmentalism’, funded by the E.S.R.C. It provides a brief overview of the theoretical background of the project as a whole which is concerned with the nature and development of children's early knowledge and awareness of environmental issues. One of the four component studies of the research project, namely ‘Emergent Knowledge of The Environment’, is then described and discussed. This provides data which illuminate the extent to which four‐year‐old children know and understand about four selected environmental issues, the sources of their knowledge and an idea of whether they have any sense of concern for the world in which they are growing up. Examples of concept maps that have been constructed for each subject are provided which demonstrate that pre‐school children may well have a strong base of accurate scientific knowledge upon which early years environmental teaching may build. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Since concept maps are designed to find out what the learner knows about a subject and are, in effect, maps of cognition, this article synthesizes relevant facts, concepts, and principles from cartography and applies them to concept mapping. The metaphor of the map and its applicability for representing scientific knowledge are discussed. The context of concept mapping is presented and suggestions for successful application of the technique in the science classroom are offered. Finally, researchers are invited to conduct studies that investigate the graphic representation of scientific knowledge in order to create, evaluate, and improve the graphics and graphic metacognitive tools (such as concept mapping) which are used in science teaching.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to describe the knowledge base of a group of science teachers in terms of their knowledge of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines, and their understanding of the nature of science. The study also aimed to relate the teachers' knowledge base to their level of education, years of teaching experience, and the class level(s) that they teach. Twenty inservice science teachers were selected to respond to a modified version of the Views on Science-Technology-Society (VOSTS) questionnaire to assess their understanding of the nature of science. The teachers then constructed concept maps and were interviewed. The concept maps were scored and the interviews analyzed to assess teachers' knowledge of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines. The teachers' knowledge base was found to be lacking in all respects. Teachers held several naive views about the nature of science and did not demonstrate adequate knowledge and understanding of the structure, function, and development of their disciplines. Moreover, the teachers' knowledge base did not relate to their years of teaching experience, the class level(s) that they teach, and their level of education. It was reasoned that teacher preparation programs are not helping teachers develop the knowledge base needed for teaching science.

AB  - In an attempt to integrate theory and practice in baccalaureate nursing education, students were taught nursing skills with two cognitive strategies (Vee heuristics and concept maps) that consciously identify and reinforce connections between scientific theory and practice. The research showed that students using Vee heuristics and concept maps, rather than traditional modes, were significantly better able to identify scientific principles to describe why specific steps of a nursing skill were done.

AB  - This study, conducted in an inner‐city middle school, followed the conceptual changes shown in 25 students' writing over a 12‐week science unit. Conceptual changes for 6 target students are reported. Student understanding was assessed regarding the nature of matter and physical change by paper‐and‐pencil pretest and posttest. The 6 target students were interviewed about the goal concepts before and after instruction. Students' writing during lesson activities provided qualitative data about their understandings of the goal concepts across the science unit. The researcher constructed concept maps from students' written statements and compared the maps across time to assess changes in the schema of core concepts, complexity, and organization as a result of instruction. Target students' changes were studied in detail to determine patterns of conceptual change. After patterns were located in target students' maps, the remaining 19 students' maps were analyzed for similar patterns. The ideas that students identified in their writing showed changes in central concepts, complexity, and organization as the lessons progressed. When instructional events were analyzed in relation to students' demonstrated ideas, understanding of the goal conceptions appeared in students' writing more often when students had opportunities to explain their new ideas orally and in writing.

AB  - The results of recent studies into the use of the concept mapping heuristic seem to demonstrate that meaningful learning results through its use in science classrooms. While this underscores the need to use more effective instructional strategies in science teaching, the issue of the intervening variable of anxiety in learning and science achievement, and the possible use of a metacognitive strategy in anxiety reduction have not been addressed. This study, therefore, sought to find out if the metacognitive strategy of concept mapping reduces anxiety and thereby enhances achievement in biology. A total of 51 (30 boys, 21 girls) senior secondary one (grade 10) students participated in this experiment. Two instruments—the Zuckerman Affect Adjective Checklist and the Biology Achievement Test—were used in pre‐ and posttest administrations to measure the treatment effect on anxiety and achievement, respectively. Findings support the stand that concept mapping is significantly more effective than the traditional/expository teaching strategy in enhancing learning in biology. In addition, it apparently reduces students' anxiety towards the learning of biology. A significant reduction of anxiety was noticed for male subjects.

AB  - Students commencing an A-level revision course in physics were asked to draw a concept map for 'energy'. Their subsequent comments on the task were generally very positive, and related to both their feelings about the work and their thoughts about their own learning. These important aspects of the student learning experience should not be ignored.

AB  - This is a descriptive account of the development of a hypertext computer program to enhance the scientific writing skills of upper secondary physics students. The program facilitates the integration of concept mapping, inferential reading, student-teacher dialogue, models of writing in the scientific register and the clear display of assessment criteria. This was achieved by the design and use of a program called 'HyperCardPhysics' (HCP) for Apple-Macintosh computers. It has been tried out in a number of schools in South Australia with positive results. © 1993 Australasian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - The study reported here is part of a larger project designed to understand the construction of meaning during collaborative concept mapping. The focus of this report is the teacher who engages students through the emerging concept maps in reflections about their knowledge of scientific concepts and how they are integrated in a larger framework. It is based on data collected over a two‐year span with about 150 students in ten sections of junior and senior physics. The data include video‐taped concept‐mapping sessions, concept maps produced during these sessions and those produced individually at home, reflective essays by the students, and the teacher’s reflective notes. Based on the data sources, three major dimensions were constructed. First, concept maps served as conscription devices which enlisted the participation of students and their teacher who constructed and used them for a variety of purposes. Second, the teacher engaged students in reflections about their knowledge through the conscription device and in his role as a coach‐facilitator‐guide. Third, in this role, the teacher conducted dynamic assessments of student understanding which were then used to intervene to help students construct meaning of scientific concepts compatible with scientific knowledge. This process of evaluation and intervention by the teacher was conceptualized as coach‐facilitator‐guide in the metaphor of the reflective practitioner. We conclude that, in our construction, collaborative concept mapping becomes a context which can assist teachers in changing their referents of action from objectivist to constructivist metaphors of teaching. © 1994 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Science graduates who enrol in a preservice Graduate Diploma of Education bring with them many years of experience as learners of science. These will have enabled them to develop implicit theories about what a science teacher is and does. Such implicit theories almost certainly affect the process of becoming a teacher, and may prove persistent despite the input from University and school during the Dip. Ed. year and beyond. This paper presents the research method and results obtained from a group of graduates on entry to their Diploma course. Concept maps and Repertory Grid interviews were obtained from eleven graduates, with varying life experiences. The paper presents analyses of these and explores emerging themes. © 1992 Australasian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - We investigated how different levels of information presented by various technologies affected secondary students' understanding of acid, base, and pH concepts. Secondary students who were selected for the study had just completed their study of acid–base chemistry. No attempt was made to provide further instruction. We analyzed changes in the understanding of individual students by constructing concept maps from the propositions that the students used in interviews conducted before and after a series of acid–base titrations. After the initial interview, students were divided into three groups. Within each group, students individually performed the same set of titrations using different technologies: chemical indicators, pH meters, and microcomputer‐based laboratories (MBL). After the titrations were completed, all students were interviewed again. We found that students using MBL exhibited a larger positive shift in their concept map scores, which indicates a greater differentiation and integration of their knowledge of acids and bases. The chemical indicator students exhibited a more moderate positive shift in their concept map scores, and the pH meter students exhibited a smaller positive shift. We also found that the MBL students constructed more inappropriate links in their concept maps than the chemical indicator or pH meter students. However, we speculate that this increased number of inappropriate links indicates a high level of involvement with the technology. We therefore argue that the level of information offered by the technology affected students' understanding of the chemical concepts. Copyright © 1994 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - The author describes a new method which facilitates more focused and effective transfer of information among people using or influencing management of marine resources. A recently developed construct, concept mapping, has been used to analyze primary scientific reports on salmonid distribution and to assess the knowledge of charter boat captains' operations on Lake Ontario. This analysis revealed key concepts and important facts concerning the distribution of fish populations in Lake Ontario. These were then combined to form a comprehensive basis for future educational efforts in the area of sportfishing. A model is provided for the generation of valid and reliable information about available scientific research and people's understandings and beliefs. This leads to the comprehensive design of natural resource programming and transfer of information through the fishery.

AB  - Concept maps for six current structural geology texts show a diversity of approaches in ordering the content of the subject. Further complications result from the interrelationships to topics, for example, en echelon vein arrays were found to be covered under folds, shear zones, regional geology, field techniques, igneous geology and strain theory. This is a consequence of many geological structures forming as composites of two broad "types' of structures on different scales, for example, en echelon vein arrays are brittle extension fractures on a small scale within a shear zone on a larger scale. A matrix with six important structural "types' on each axis with the horizontal axis representing the smaller scale and the vertical axis representing the larger scale provides a framework for 36 "types' of composite structures. This concept matrix can be used as an introduction to structures, a summary of structures or a guide for student investigations of structures. -from Author

AB  - This study explored students' conceptual understanding and conceptual growth regarding classical mechanics in the natural context of a Grade-level 10 science classroom. The purpose of the study was to determine the pervasiveness of a pattern observed in an earlier study in which learners initially gave evidence of scientifically valid knowledge structures but then returned or regressed to an earlier, primitive level of understanding. In the current study, concept mapping and interview methods were used to capture students' construction of knowledge patterns across a survey course designed to focus on some big ideas in physics The analyses of mean ratings of student-generated concept maps and interview transcripts over three data collections did not consistently reveal the progression-regression patterns across the instruction as observed in the earlier study. The students' knowledge structures remained stable across the 10 weeks and remained unchanged 4 weeks after instruction ceased, suggesting that very little construction or restructuring of knowledge was taking place, and possibly worse, that the students' existing knowledge was not challenged sufficiently to promote the construction or reconstruction process. Implications of the alternative interpretations are discussed. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The search for new, authentic science assessments of what students know and can do is well under way. This has unearthed measures of students' hands-on performance in carrying out science investigations, and has been expanded to discover more or less direct measures of students' knowledge structures. One potential finding is concept mapping, the focus of this review. A concept map is a graph consisting of nodes representing concepts and labeled lines denoting the relation between a pair of nodes. A student's concept map is interpreted as representing important aspects of the organization of concepts in his or her memory (cognitive structure). In this article we characterize a concept map used as an assessment tool as: (a) a task that elicits evidence bearing on a student's knowledge structure in a domain, (b) a format for the student's response, and (c) a scoring system by which the student's concept map can be evaluated accurately and consistently. Based on this definition, multiple concept-mapping techniques were found from the myriad of task, response format, and scoring system variations identified in the literature. Moreover, little attention has been paid to the reliability and validity of these variations. The review led us to arrive at the following conclusions: (a) an integrative working cognitive theory is needed to begin to limit this variation in concept-mapping techniques for assessment purposes; (b) before concept maps are used for assessment and before map scores are reported to teachers, students, the public, and policy makers, research needs to provide reliability and validity information on the effect of different mapping techniques; and (c) research on students' facility in using concept maps, on training techniques, and on the effect on teaching is needed if concept map assessments are to be used in classrooms and in large-scale accountability systems.

AB  - Science educators working with prospective elementary teachers strive to facilitate an understanding of science as well as an understanding of student and teacher roles in learning science in the classroom. One goal should be the introduction of strategies which assist prospective teachers in learning independently. Concept mapping provides a useful learning tool in assisting students' critical reading of assigned materials. In this study, each student constructed his or her own map which facilitated group discussions and provided further opportunity to reflect on the ideas being presented. The purpose of reading became making connections instead of absorbing information. Through the process students gained a better understanding of a way of thinking about science which provides a valuable foundation for facilitating continued learning. © 1990 The Association for the Education of Teachers in Science (AETS).

AB  - Within the framework of research on alternative scientific conceptions, this study explored and documented frequencies of common knowledge errors about AIDS, genital herpes, gonorrhea, and syphilis in a multi-age population composed of high school, community college, and university students. The purpose was to examine developmental trends in knowledge about sexually transmitted diseases among individuals entering the sexually active years. Using clinical interviews, concept maps, and a Likert-type instrument, the study focused on students' knowledge of the etiology, transmission, symptoms, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of STDs. Results suggest that individuals of all ages are more knowledgeable about AIDS than any other sexually transmitted disease; however, many individuals harbor an array of potentially harmful misconceptions. Among the other STDs, there is substantial confusion about etiology and the course and efficacy of treatment. Furthermore, it appears that many individuals overgeneralize their knowledge about AIDS, especially with respect to the mode of transmission and the protection afforded by the use of condoms. © 1993 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Concept mapping was used to tap the conceptual disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge of seven biology and six geography teachers with short or long teaching experience. Based on five knowledge structure dimensions, the results were that (1) the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge of teachers of both biology and geography is quite unsatisfactory; (2) the two types of knowledge did not improve with experience and the latter slightly deteriorated; and (3) the teachers mastered their disciplinary knowledge better than their pedagogical knowledge. The results are discussed in relation to the nature of the instructional activities and the different status of the disciplinary and pedagogical knowledge in teaching.

AB  - Schema theory and research from cognitive psychology have been applied fruitfully in science education over the last decade. Their implications for improving social studies education are drawn, in particular identifying key ideas, using graphic concept maps in instruction, and assessing students' prior knowledge and its connections. A conceptualization of differences between children of different ages according to the characteristics of their cognitive structures and processes is suggested. Anticipated difficulties with the approach as a whole are also outlined. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Recent reviews of research into students’ conceptual scientific knowledge have suggested that future studies should go beyond identifying and describing students’ conceptual knowledge, and focus more on student learning characteristics related to the development of better conceptual knowledge. In parts 1 and 2 of this paper we describe studies of the relationship between students’ propositional knowledge (as measured by concept‐mapping tasks) and their study strategies (as measured by a self‐report questionnaire) for ‘electricity’ (part 1) and ‘photosynthesis’ (part 2) in first‐year university courses. The results show that deeper and more meaningful study strategies are associated with better propositional knowledge. They also show that, depending on context, prior knowledge has both a direct and an indirect impact on post knowledge. The indirect impact occurs as a result of the effect of prior knowledge on the adoption of study strategies. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This paper reports on the use of a HyperCard™-based tool to create and modify concept maps about science related subject matter. The tool was trialed with seventy-one preservice teachers who were planning to teach a science topic to a primary school class. Data gathered from interviews, journals and analysis of concept maps indicated that the concept mapping tool was easy to use because it generated little cognitive load and quickly became transparent to the users. This allowed preservice teachers to focus their attention upon the construction of their maps and to organise their cognitive frameworks into more powerful integrated patterns. It was also found that the process of concept map construction may enhance preservice teacher thinking about effective teaching.

AB  - This study sought further evidence of the concurrent validity of concept mapping as a research and evaluation tool in science education. Specifically, the study examined the extent to which differences exist in the concept maps of advanced college biology majors (N = 25) and beginning nonmajors (N = 25) in the domain of mammals. Furthermore, it explored whether these differences are reflected in the way subjects assign class membership as revealed in a card sorting task. The results indicate that concept maps of biology majors are structurally more complex than those of nonmajors and that differences in the structural complexity and organizational patterns depicted in concept maps are reflected in the underlying dimensions used to assign class membership. Together, these findings suggest that the concept map provides a theoretically powerful and psychometrically sound tool for assessing conceptual change in experimental and classroom settings.

AB  - An investigation of students' knowledge after a traditional advanced high-school course in electromagnetism shows deficiencies of their knowledge in three major areas: (1) the structure of knowledge - e.g., realizing the importance of central ideas, such as Maxwell's equations (expressed qualitatively); (2) conceptual understanding - e.g., understanding the relationships between the electric field and its sources; and (3) application of central relationships in problem solving. To remedy these deficiencies we propose an instructional model which integrates problem solving, conceptual understanding and the construction of the knowledge structure. The central activity of the students is a gradual construction of a hierarchical concept map organized around Maxwell's equations as central ideas of the domain. The students construct the map in five stages: (1) SOLVE - they solve a set of problems that highlight the central ideas in the domain; (2) REFLECT - they reflect on the conceptual basis of their solutions; (3) CONCEPTUALIZE - they perform activities that deal with relevant conceptual difficulties; (4) APPLY - they carry out complex applications; (5) LINK - they link their activities to the evolving concept map. This integrative model (experimental treatment) was compared to an isolated treatment of drill and practice or treatment of conceptual difficulties without linkage to the proposed knowledge structure. The comparison shows that students in the experimental treatment performed better than the other students on measures of recall, conceptual knowledge and problem solving. Students in the experimental treatment were also able to transfer and extract central ideas in a domain different than physics. © 1997 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - Studies have shown that physical science students' understanding of concepts, and relations between concepts, is often less than would be expected from the assessment results they achieve. Explanations for the difference include the widespread use in examinations of ‘problems' which, given sufficient rehearsal, become little more than exercises. Many of these examinations containing exercises are also thought to encourage surface approaches to learning, leading to lower quality learning outcomes. In this study we compare students' performances in an alternative assessment method — creativity exercises — with their results in concept mapping and traditional examination exercises. Student performance in all three methods was found to correlate positively with a deep study strategy, while low correlations between the three methods suggest that they may test three different aspects of chemistry knowledge. If used together these methods may encourage a deeper approach to learning, contribute to a greater understanding of the subject and be more beneficial in helping students improve their learning and problem solving abilities. © 1990, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The purpose of this research study was to (a) describe how concept mapping can be used as an integral instructional strategy for teaching a college course on evolution, (b) evaluate the utility of incorporating concept mapping in a college course on evolution, (c) determine whether students' concept maps reveal “critical junctures” in learning as the course unfolds, and (d) assess the impact of concept mapping on students' study practices and on students' understanding of course content. Key findings include: (a) Critical junctures in learning evolution can be identified by monitoring the degree of concordance of superordinate concepts appearing on the class set of concept maps submitted after each of the course lectures; (b) students who made concept maps reported spending an average of 37% more study time on this college biology course than on their previous biology courses; and (c) the use of “seed concepts,” “micromapping,” a standard concept map format, and a standard concept map checklist made the strategy feasible for the instructor to implement and for the student to adopt. A concept map performance index formulas was also developed for this research study in order to assess students' overall mapping performance. Copyright © 1994 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Abstract Computer‐based tutoring of visual concepts is a largely unexplored area. The ability to classify images, to identify features and to describe abnormalities is a necessary part of training in many professions, such as radiology, anatomy, botany and geology. To a lesser level it is important for developing everyday skills such as identifying birds, trees, rocks, and flowers. The aim of this paper is to show how computers might be used in visual concept teaching, to store and display large stocks of exemplar images, to carry out a tutorial dialogue with the learner, and to provide learning aids such as concept maps, feature spaces, and structural models. The paper describes well‐established methods for teaching visual concepts and indicates how computers can supplement the human teacher in tutoring students with differing levels of expertise.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine relationships between structural characteristics of students' concept maps about chemical equilibrium and independent measures of their achievement in chemistry. Fifty students in 1991 and seventy students in 1992 completed a concept-mapping task using twenty-four specified concepts. Using similarities in concept map structure, based on the presence or absence of linked pairs of concepts, non-metric multidimensional scaling (MDS) was used to plot the location of the concept maps in coordinate space. The distribution of maps was based on differences in their structure, but also reflected levels of student achievement on independent tests. The relationship between the coordinate location of each student's maps and his or her test scores on independent chemistry achievement tests was sought by canonical correlation analysis of the 1991 data set. This revealed significant relationships between the MDS coordinates and test scores of recall of knowledge and its application. Multiple regression analysis of sixty-one students' maps from the 1992 data set against their percentile rank scores on a national chemistry quiz revealed significant relationships. The results are interpreted as revealing structural differences in conceptual organisation about chemical equilibrium among students with different levels of achievement and thus relative expertise in the domain. The significant relationship between map structure and cognitive process scores in chemistry also supports the view that the organisation of declarative knowledge influences its accessibility in cognitive tasks.

AB  - Cognitive/concept mapping is an educational strategy that takes into consideration the principles of educational psychology. The most important single factor that influences learning is what the learner already knows. Nursing students face a great need to understand the larger questions and problems of their chosen field. Unless there is understanding, students may only commit unassimilated data to short-term memory and no meaningful learning will occur. The purpose of the following paper is to present concept mapping as a learning/teaching strategy for nursing students and nursing faculty. Examples of maps will be presented along with suggestions about how they can be used to plan care for a particular client or to learn more about the nursing care of a specific disease process.

AB  - Concept maps have been used to present information and to facilitate learning by students constructing their own maps, but there have been few studies on concept maps as a tool for research into the nature of student learning and the evaluation of the effectiveness of teaching. In setting concept mapping exercises two main issues have been identified, the framework in which students construct their maps (ie the instructions and assistance provided) and procedures for analyzing complete maps. Students taking a history course at a distance, generated concept maps after studying an introductory teaching unit on quantum mechanics. Analysis of the maps and comparison with the unit authors’map showed students’failure to identify‘radiation’as a central concept and to make links between concepts considered essential by the authors. Inspection of the teaching material indicated that‘radiation’as a central concept was implicit rather than directly explained. Analysis of students’descriptions of relationships between concepts identified different levels of description, with a group of students consistently responding at higher level than the rest of the sample. The study confirmed the usefulness of concept maps as a tool for research and evaluation and their potential for development as qualitative measures of learning. Copyright © 1994, Wiley Blackwell.

AB  - The aim of this study was to describe science teachers' knowledge of specific biology and physics topics and trace the effects of this knowledge on their planning for instruction and on simulated teaching. Six experienced secondary-school teachers - three specializing in physics and three in biology - participated in the study. Each teacher's knowledge of a biology topic and a physics topic was assessed using summary free recall, concept-map line labeling, and sorting tasks. A small number of schemata described each teacher's subject-matter knowledge. The teachers planned instruction in the biology and physics topics based on content in textbook chapters provided by the investigator. The planning took place in thinking-aloud sessions. The influence of the teachers' prior subject-matter knowledge was evident in their modifications of textbook subject-matter content and through their use of explanatory representations. Simulated teaching consisted of a critical-incidents technique. The effects of subject-matter knowledge were apparent here through the teachers' use of evaluative structures and responses to critical incidents. © 1987.

AB  - Polymers is a subject studied as an elective unit by senior high school students in Israel who major in chemistry. Motivated by lack of adequate means to model dynamic processes and 3D structure of polymers, the hazard and cost of experiments with polymers, and the need for different complexity levels, we have developed a computer-aided instruction (CAI) module on polymers. The module consists of three topics: organic chemistry, polymerization, and structure and characteristics. Three “information organizers”, concept map, database, and index, enable easy navigation and access to information. Each topic ends with a set of problems, for which immediate responses are provided. The use of graphics and animation enables a vivid display of molecular structure and polymerization processes. The module has been assessed by teachers using two tools, a questionnaire and the Card Traversal Graph, and was found to respond to needs that originally motivated us to develop the software. © 1993, American Chemical Society.

AB  - This research addressed children’s difficulty in learning science meaningfully. A Wittgensteinian analysis of meanings suggests that they arise in successful acts of communication in the context of specific types of shared activity. From this perspective, communication between pupils in using scientific ideas should provide a worthwhile, effective learning task. Concept mapping provides a means of structuring discussion about scientific meanings. The research used primarily qualitative approaches to investigate the potential for collaborative concept mapping to improve 9- to 11-year-old children’s learning in science. Analysis of the talk in pupil groups identified the processes at work in the discussion. The structure of the discussion differed substantially from common patterns of classroom talk, often involving children in collaborative construction of the relationships shown in the concept maps. The findings show concept mapping to be beneficial for learning, and to support sustained small-group discussion of scientific ideas. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concept mapping and vee diagramming are metalearning tools that have recently appeared on the science education scene. Literature attesting to their metacognitive potentials for students provide reason for optimism regarding their use for tackling rote memorization of scientific concepts. Are teachers who are key agents in the diffusion process of an educational innovation positively disposed towards these new metalearning tools? This is the broad question addressed in this study. The first phase of the study resulted in the development and validation of an instrument - the Attitude towards Concept- and Vee-Mapping Inventory (ACVMI). The second phase involved the use of this instrument to collect data for answering two major research questions. Data obtained from 48 biology, 36 chemistry, 24 physics and 33 mathematics teachers who had been trained in and had used the two tools showed a largely favourable attitude towards learning the techniques and using them in teaching science rather than mathematics. Both science and mathematics teachers expressed views favouring both metalearning tools in terms of their benefits in the areas of meaningful learning and reduction of anxiety levels. A few questions were tackled in the study and some more questions surfaced. One of these is the observed poor attitude of mathematics teachers towards vee mapping. The other is how to assist teachers in teaching both concept mapping and vee mapping such that they can gain greater confidence, especially with teaching vee mapping in science and mathematics classrooms. Research focused on these and related questions is eagerly awaited. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Two unobtrusive diagnostic game-like instruments, especially designed to determine junior high school science teachers’ meaningful understanding of functional relationships, between some of the basic concepts related to the abstract notion of the ‘living cell’, are described in this paper. The basic assumption was that teachers, although apparently familiar with each of the relevant concepts separately, do not perceive many of the relationships which confer upon them their ‘meaning’, in an Ausubelian sense. A concept map, specifically adapted to the level expected from junior high-school teachers, was designed and validated by scientists. While readily playing the ‘games’, individual teachers displayed the type and the relevance of the relationships which they established between concepts, their level of meaningful understanding (area covered on the exemplary concept-map), and its availability (spontaneity of use). The main outcomes of this study show that quite often, teachers do not spontaneously establish connections between concepts and therefore do not perceive the implications of their otherwise correct declarative knowledge. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Studies have shown that in their study of biology, students perceive genetics and ecology to be difficult areas to learn. This has translated into rote learning of genetics and ecological concepts and reflected in poor performance in tests involving these concepts. Considering the importance of genetics and ecology to man's understanding of himself and his environment, there is a need to inquire into ways of ensuring that students attain meaningful learning of genetics and ecology rather than learning by rote. The efficacy of the concept‐mapping strategy was tried out in this study with 138 predegree biology students. The results showed that the 63 students in the experimental group who employed the concept‐mapping technique performed significantly better on the test of meaningful learning in genetics, t(136) = 16.01. p < 0.001, and ecology, t(136) = 12.27, p < 0.001, than their control group counterparts (N = 75). The implications of these results for teacher education in biology are addressed in the article. Copyright © 1990 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Although research on teacher cognition is no longer in its infancy, it has largely failed to affect the ways in which programs and teachers are evaluated. In accordance with what Raths and Katz (1985) call the Goldilocks Principle, the notion of teacher cognition may simply be “too big” (too general and vague) for mundane application. This review was designed to compare alternative approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition and to consider ways in which the literature of this subfield may be discouraging its application. Teacher cognition is defined as pre- or inservice teachers’ self-reflections; beliefs and knowledge about teaching, students, and content; and awareness of problem-solving strategies endemic to classroom teaching. This paper describes and critiques five different approaches to the evaluation of teacher cognition: (a) direct and noninferential ways of assessing teacher belief, (b) methods that rely on contextual analyses of teachers’ descriptive language, (c) taxonomies for assessing self-reflection and metacognition, (d) multimethod evaluations of pedagogical content knowledge and beliefs, and (e) concept mapping. In the final section, ambiguities and paradoxes inherent in this literature are discussed, particularly the continued use of rhetoric associated with process–product research. Questions regarding the ecological validity of measurement tools and tasks are raised. A suggestion is made that it may be politically exigent to begin relating measures of teacher cognition to valued student outcomes. © 1990, Sage Publications. All rights reserved.

AB  - The growth of the literature on topic difficulties within the last two decades has indexed an increase in students' aversion towards key concepts in the sciences. This study explored the possibility that the concept-mapping strategy could be a fruitful way of reducing the anxiety levels of students as well as helping to change their attitudes towards concepts that are traditionally perceived to be difficult. Data collected from 138 pre-degree biology students on two areas of biology—ecology and genetics—that are perceived to be highly difficult show that (1) those students who were exposed to the concept-mapping strategy (experimental group; N = 63) had a significantly lower level of anxiety than the control (N=75) in ecology and genetics; (2) after treatment, the experimental group students perceived ecology to be less difficult. They also recorded a significantly lower mean score in their perception of the difficulty of genetics when compared with the control. Overall, the results showed that students' perception of the difficulty of and anxiety toward ecology and genetics—traditionally dreaded areas of biology, changed for the better as a result of engagement in concept mapping. The implications of these results for instruction and for further research are drawn. © 1989, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - Concept maps have been used in education, policy studies and the philosophy of science to provide a visual representation of knowledge structures and argument forms. They provide a complementary alternative to natural language as a means of communicating knowledge. In many disciplines various forms of concept map are already used as formal knowledge representation systems, for example: semantic networks in artificial intelligence, bond graphs in mechanical and electrical engineering, Petri nets in communications, and category graphs in mathematics. This paper describes the design and application of a groupware concept mapping tool designed to support the knowledge processes of geographically dispersed ccmurmnities. © 1994 ACM.

AB  - The quantitative Knowledge Space Theory is applied here for the first time to specific science concepts in order to evaluate its feasibility as a general assessment method for science learning. In particular, the knowledge states of students in the 4th through 12th grades are suggested for three science concepts before and after classroom teaching/learning experiences. The theory belongs to the vast category of latent trait models based upon the Rasch model, but differs in all its most important characteristics by having the power to extract the cognitive organization of the material. Student responses to the pre-tests and the post-tests were analyzed for the pressure concept, the density concept and the conservation of matter, and tentative critical learning pathways for each concept are suggested which describe the most probable sequences of learning steps. In all three cases the quantitative results show a change in the students’ logic structure after the classroom experience. Knowledge Space Theory shows considerable promise for providing a useful quantitative analysis technique for assessing and analyzing the knowledge of students when used with other assessment methods such as concept mapping and clinical interviews. Ultimately, exemplary strategies and materials may be identified by this procedure for helping teachers effectively move students along the most probable critical learning pathways as suggested by the students themselves. © 1997, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study examines the internal consistency of Novak and Gowin’s scoring scheme and its effect on the prediction validity of concept mapping as an alternative science classroom achievement assessment. Data were collected in three typical situations: very limited concept mapping experience with free-style concept mapping; some concept mapping experience with questions provided; extensive concept mapping experience with a list of concepts provided for. It was found that Novak’s scoring scheme was not internally consistent, and therefore there was generally no significant correlation between students’ scores on concept mapping and students’ scores on conventional classroom achievement assessments. The need for a new scoring scheme when concept mapping is used as an alternative science assessment is discussed. © 1996, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - The directed‐inquiry approach to learning science process skills and scientific problem solving [DIAL(SPS)2] was developed to help high‐school students gain the critical thinking skills required to solve problems in the biology lab. This curriculum integrated several learning strategies into a single approach: advance organizers, the learning cycle, concept maps, Vee diagrams, a focusing strategy, and writing. Two general questions were addressed. First, was the DIAL(SPS)2 treatment more effective than a conventional treatment? Second, was there evidence of an aptitude‐treatment interaction? Four high‐school biology classes taught by this investigator were used to test the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum. Scheduling of students involved ability grouping. To test the curriculum in the most rigorous way, the experimental group consisted of average ability students and the comparison group consisted of above‐average students. Both the groups were pretested in August and posttested in May. In the intervening time, the experimental group received the DIAL(SPS)2 treatment while the comparison group received a more traditional approach. Analysis of covariance revealed that the DIAL(SPS)2 curriculum had no significant effect on the learning of science process skills or on cognitive development. Aptitude‐treatment interaction analyses revealed an interaction of DIAL(SPS)2 treatment and cognitive development. Copyright © 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - This article examines the impact of a specially designed in‐service model on teacher understanding of selected science concepts. The underlying idea of the model is to get teachers to restructure their own understanding of a selected science topic by having them study the structure and evolution of their students' ideas on the same topic. Concepts on topics from the life, earth, and physical sciences served as the content focus and middle school Grades 4–9 served as the context for this study. The in‐service experience constituting the main treatment in the study occurred in three distinct phases. In the initial phase, participating teachers interviewed several of their own students to find out what kinds of preconceptions students had about a particular topic. The teachers used concept mapping strategies learned in the in‐service to facilitate the interviews. Next the teachers teamed with other teachers with similar topic interests and a science expert to evaluate and explore the scientific merit of the student conceptual frameworks and to develop instructional units, including a summative assessment during a summer workshop. Finally, the student ideas were further evaluated and explored as the teachers taught the topics in their classrooms during the fall term. Concept maps were used to study changes in teacher understanding across the phases of the in‐service in a repeated‐measures design. Analysis of the maps showed significant growth in the number of valid propositions expressed by teachers between the initial and final mappings in all topic groups. But in half of the groups, this long‐term growth was interrupted by a noticeable decline in the number of valid propositions expressed. In addition, analysis of individual teacher maps showed distinctive patterns of initial invalid conceptions being replaced by new invalid conceptions in later mappings. The combination of net growth of valid propositions and the patterns of evolving invalid conceptions is discussed in constructivist terms. Copyright © 1993 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - Problem solving is an enduring issue in science education, ostensibly because science itself is basically concerned with problem solving—exploring the universe and seeking answers to intriguing phenomena in nature. Remarkable strides have been made in psychology about recording the minutiae of problem solving as a cognitive process. Concept mapping, a metaleaning tool, is appearing on the scene as a potential pathway for promoting the acquisition of problem-solving skills. Drawing 40 subjects from a pool of students who experienced cooperative and individualistic concept-mapping experiences for six months and adjudged to be good concept mappers, this study found the concept-, mapping group to be significantly more successful in solving three biological problems than 20 subjects who served as control Written and think-aloud procedures and interviews were conducted as part of the administration of the Biology Problem Solving Test. No statistically significant difference was found between students who mapped concepts cooperatively and those who mapped individually. There were mixed results for gender. The implications of the findings for further research and for improving problem-solving abilities of students are drawn. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - This study examined successive and progressive changes in the structural complexity of knowledge held by introductory, college-level biology students and how those changes are affected by the students' primary learning mode and gender. To examine the way learners restructure knowledge over the course of a semester, subjects constructed concept maps at 4-week intervals throughout the term. The maps were then evaluated for structural complexity and change based on the works of other investigators. Results suggest that a substantial amount of knowledge restructuring takes place and that much of it is incremental in nature; "accretion" and "tuning" accounting for 75% of the observed structural changes. Of potential importance, however, is that "radical" changes involving higher order, superordinate concepts are concentrated in the first 4 weeks of the semester. The observed relationships between knowledge restructuring and predominant learning mode and gender of students are potentially significant. The evidence suggests that students who use "active," "deep " information processing strategies construct more elaborate, well-differentiated knowledge structures. Furthermore, it appears that gender may be an important mediator of meaningful learning. It is particularly notable that where gender differences were found, they tended to favor females. © 1997 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The validity of several dimensions of knowledge which were inferred from concept maps was assessed for its psychometric and edumetric aspects. Data were collected from 14 students who enrolled in the university first-year introductory geomorphology course and in its prerequisite introductory geology course. They took an objective geomorphology test, the tree construction task, and the Standardized Concept Structuring Analysis Technique (SConSAT) version of concept mapping. Comparisons among these dimensions of knowledge before and after the geomorphology course yielded convergent evidence. For the psychometric perspective, the SConSAT version of concept mapping and tree construction had similar knowledge structure representations, and the cognitive map correctness was moderately positively correlated with the objective test but not with the geomorphology course test. For the edumetric perspective, the majority of the dimensions of knowledge structures from the SConSAT showed large improvements following the geomorphology course. This evidence shows that the knowledge structure dimensions have moderate to good construct validity which warrant their widespread use for evaluating learning outcomes in both experimental and classroom settings.

AB  - The long term aim of this study is to document changes in the nature and level of conceptual understanding revealed by a cohort of undergraduate nursing students. The outcome of such a study may be used in future review and redesign processes by curriculum planners. Conceptual understanding of physiology and pharmacology, areas which are central to nursing studies depends, in turn, on an understanding of certain chemical concepts. This paper describes the group cognitive structure of 60 first year preservice nursing students, with respect to 21 basic chemistry concepts. Group cognitive structure is represented by non-metric multidimensional scaling of data obtained from individual concept maps prepared by students. The impact of prior studies in chemistry on the level of understanding revealed is discussed. © 1990 Austrlasian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - Concept mapping is an educational tool that encourages meaninful learning fostering meaningful and self-directed learning among medical students is now recognized as a major goal of medical educators (ACME-TRI Report, 1992). Meaningful learning (learning with understanding) is much stronger and longer-lasting than rote learning (learning by memorization) because students address the conceptual meaning of the knowledge being learned, and link this new information with previous knowledge. Concept mapping is an active, creative, visual and spatial learning activity in which concepts are organized according to their hierarchical relationships. Linking words are used to describe the relationships among the concepts. To create a concept map, students must understand the information that will appear in the map. Students must also relate and integrate the concepts that will be recorded in the map. As a result students replace unidirectional linear organization with thinking which proceeds in multiple directions. This improves long-term information retention, reduces verbatim retention of nonmeaningful information, and improves transfer of knowledge in future problem solving activities. interested students and faculty can acquire concept mapping skill through a 2-3 hour workshop. Participants are given a brief overview of meaningful learning and concept mapping. Then, with guidance from workshop facilitators, they create their own concept maps. Next, a debriefing session is held for participants to discuss their experience with concept mapping. Finally, to consolidate and enhance newly developed concept mapping skills, follow-up mapping activities are assigned. Once students acquire concept mapping skill, they can use it to: (1) organize and integrate information; (2) assess existing knowledge; (3) gain insights into new and existing knowledge; and (4) relate basic science concepts to clinical presentation of the patient. Students can continue to use concept mapping as they go through clinical clerkships and residency programs. As practicing physicians they can use the method to gain a meaningful understanding of new concepts and to integrate these new concepts with prior concepts retained in long-term memory.

AB  - Both chemistry teachers and nonmajor students appear to agree that freshman chemistry may well be the most problematic traditional science discipline taught in the first year of college—as far as students' misunderstandings, learning difficulties, and misconceptions are concerned. The above is probably due to the many abstract, nonintuitive concepts, which are not directly interrelated. Consequently, in such cases, the powerful, general teaching strategy of “concept mapping” must be replaced by alternative, specific strategies. Selected illustrative examples of students' learning difficulties and misconceptions in freshman general and organic chemistry are presented in the students' terms, followed by the corresponding successfully applied, specific, concept‐oriented, eclectic intervention strategies the author uses in order to overcome the difficulties. Based on longitudinal in‐class observations, interpretive study, and analysis it is suggested that those students' misconceptions in freshman chemistry which are not interrelated logically and/or derived from one another are not prone to the general “concept mapping” approach and should be dealt with by using the appropriate, specific teaching strategy.

AB  - Using conceptual change as a theoretical lens, the purpose of this study is to describe the structure of a learner's conceptual ecology within a specific content area (biological evolution) and to illustrate how this ecology influences the process of conceptual change. Data were gathered using participant observations in a high school Biology II classroom as well as a series of 17 open‐ended and structured interviews with each of four research participants. The interviews were designed to illustrate the participants' approaches to biology as well as to describe their changing conceptual frameworks for evolutionary theory. Interview techniques used include: concept mapping, drawing interviews, discussion of pre‐ and posttests, and sorting tasks. A learner's conceptual ecology for evolution was found to include prior conceptions related to evolutionary theory (both scientific and alternative), scientific and religious orientations, view of the biological world, and acceptance of evolutionary theory. However, the data demonstrate that the actions of these aspects of the conceptual ecology can vary among individuals and no single controlling mechanism was isolated. Most importantly, the data demonstrate that conceptual change has significant affective cornponents as evidence is evaluated by learners and this evaluation is often based on extralogical criteria. © 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - The objective of this study was to determine if a concept map used as an advance organizer can improve the science achievement of eighth‐grade students. Eighty‐two eighth‐grade students in four science classes participated in this study. The experimental group completed the concept map at the beginning of the science unit under the teacher's supervision. At the end of the two‐week unit a science test was administered to the experimental and the control group. The results of a one‐tailed t test indicated that there was a significant difference between the two groups. The effect size is 0.40. It appears that the concept map can provide the classroom teachers with a meaningful and practical structured approach for using advance organizers in their classes.

AB  - The search for more effective, alternative instructional strategies has led to focusing attention on the metacognitive strategy of concept mapping. The heuristic of concept mapping assists learners in understanding concepts and relationships between them and seeing the hierarchical conceptual propositional nature of knowledge. While the search for the enhancement of meaningful learning through metacognition is being intensified, there is a need to relate it to other classroom climate variables that could hamper the total classroom functioning of a student in the learning of science. This study investigated the relationship between the concept mapping heuristic and anxiety‐a variable that has been found to have a militating effect on learning. A total of 51 senior secondary school students formed the sample of the study. Using a pre‐post‐test experimental design, the experimental subjects had a 6‐week treatment of learning selected science concepts through the concept mapping strategy. Analysis of the data collected showed the instructional strategy involving concept mapping to be effective and to lead to a significant lowering in students’ anxiety towards the study of science. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The research reported in this article addressed the fundamental question, What do students believe about the nature of the world around them? The research specifically addressed college students' fundamental beliefs about nature, that is, the natural world. Data were collected via semistructured interviews involving a set of elicitation devices used to encourage students to talk about the natural world. The analysis of interview transcripts yielded inferences about student fundamental beliefs based on logicostructural world view theory. These beliefs are presented in the form of a concept map and characterized by a set of bipolar descriptive codes: naturalism and religion; chaos and order; mystery and knowledge; function and purpose; mundane and special; science/no science. Perhaps the most intriguing observation of the study was science's apparent lack of influence on students' beliefs about nature even though these students had been successful in college level science courses.

AB  - In this study, concept mapping was assessed as an instructional strategy for use by high school students in learning biology concepts. Concept mapping, which requires learners to plot concepts and their interrelations in a meaningful organizational network, was compared with an established curriculum approach and tested in an interaction with learners of varying verbal ability. The design emphasized external validity. As hypothesized, concept mapping facilitated low-ability learners’ performance, but only on higher level, relational knowledge. The usefulness of the technique was discussed in terms of its ability to individualize and raise the quality of learning with little extra effort or resource costs to the instructional system. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This chapter presents a list of processes, by specifying their goals, the features of the input components they act upon, and the characteristics of the output that form the basis for the next level of processing. The description focuses on a critical analysis of current concepts in the field, also inventories the major conceptual and functional issues that arise at each level of processing. The scope and the difficulty of these problems clearly point to the necessity of analyzing the preconditions for the construction of a text-processing model. Text models can be classified broadly into three major types: concept maps, inter- and intra- propositional grammatical analyses, and text typologies. A task defines the purpose, or the goal, and by extension the operations to be accomplished. The three main tasks generally assigned to subjects are comprehension, retention, and summarizing. © 1991 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

AB  - Schemes of common‐sense knowledge of Italian students and teachers have been inferred from the answers to a paper‐and‐pencil test, the items of which are centred on real life situations involving thermal phenomena. The analysis, performed by the use of concept maps, shows that the schemes are, by and large, richer and less detached from the scientific framework than is generally supposed. There is no confusion between the concepts of heat and temperature and people know that more than these concepts is needed to explain everyday phenomena. The results show that the word ‘heat’ is often introduced as an intermediate step, necessary to explain temperature increases due to mechanical actions. This suggests an intuition of either internal energy or entropy. It is also shown that the constancy of temperature during phase transitions is scarcely known or that it is considered a peculiarity of the boiling of water. © 1990 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

This article describes a qualitative research study that analyzed how linkages are made between theoretical material and clinical nursing practice. Findings indicate that nursing students did not link the elements of nursing process together, that clinical preparation was not linked to theoretical material, that the meaning students made of the information was different than the instructors' and that concepts from the basic sciences were not incorporated into student meaning structures. Implications for the use of concept maps as an educational strategy in continuing nursing education are drawn.

AB  - This study explored and documented the frequencies of conceptual difficulties confronted by college students seeking to understand the basic processes of cellular respiration. Using concept maps, clinical interviews and an open‐ended instrument, viewpoints were elicited from 100 (novice) introductory biology students before and after relevant instruction in cellular respiration and from 100 (experienced) students enrolled in advanced biology courses. Chi‐square analyses revealed significant differences among groups in the frequencies of scientifically acceptable and alternative conceptions. The findings suggest that novices harbor a wide range of conceptual difficulties that constrain their understanding of cellular respiration. Furthermore, many of these difficulties persist after instruction and new ones arise. Often these conceptual problems remain intact among experienced students despite well‐planned, repeated instruction at advanced levels. Copyright © 1994 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - The process of knowledge acquisition requires that nursing students obtain concepts which must be encoded, stored, and later recalled from long-term memory. To assist students with these processes, teaching strategies that structure content should be used throughout the curriculum. This article describes how the instructional strategies of concept mapping and synthesizers were used to facilitate nursing students' encoding and recalling of pharmacology concepts in an undergraduate pharmacology course.

AB  - This article outlines the use of concept maps as a tool for science curriculum development and discusses the changes that occur in the teacher's view of the curriculum with successive revisions of the maps. Although we have used concept mapping in curriculum development with teachers from grades 4–8, we describe in detail the maps created by sixth‐grade teachers. We analyzed the maps using three criteria: hierarchical structure, progressive differentiation, and integrative reconciliation. Changes made to the maps during the revision process, including additions and deletions, show increased clarification of both the concepts to be learned and the connections between them. Consecutive map revisions show the development of a cohesive conceptual grade‐six science curriculum. The use of concept maps can help science teachers develop science curriculum that is hierarchically arranged, integrated, and conceptually driven.

AB  - The present study examined whether notions students hold about scientific concepts are impacted by generating and testing hypotheses. Students enrolled in three ninth grade physical science classes were asked to select and test two student-generated hypotheses concerning flotation. Conceptual change was assessed by concept maps and word sorting activities administered at three points in the investigation (pre, mid, and post). Lawson's Classroom Test of Scientific Reasoning (CTSR) and the Integrated Test of Process Skills (TIPS) were used to assess scientific reasoning ability and proficiency with science process skills, respectively. Twenty-one of 63 students enrolled in the course completed the battery of assessment items and met the classroom attendance requirement. Those 21 students represented the data sample. Students selecting and investigating the hypothesis that weight determines an object's ability to float generally changed their notion of the relationship between weight and flotation. Students investigating the hypothesis that shape determines an object's ability to float did not exhibit conceptual change regarding shape. 1996 School Science and Mathematics Association.

AB  - This paper outlines the history of the teaching of genetics in A-level Biology courses and defines the candidates who are taught it, in terms of their prior knowledge of the subject, obtained both formally and informally. The JMB syllabus is used as an example of how to identify and define the necessary concepts. Current A-level texts are used to produce a glossary of necessary terms and consideration is given to problems that arise from the use of terms whose definitions are unclear. The terms are then used to represent concepts and are organized into concept maps. Finally different methods of sequencing the course are considered. © 1986, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The problem-solving process used by scientists and by clinicians is compared and contrasted. The most creative step for both groups is the ability to make an association between some external stimulus or situation and concepts stored in memory. Medical education must put more emphasis on teaching that improves students’ abilities to make these associations. Two teaching methods that can promote development of the necessary association skills in clinical contexts—“wait time” and “concept mapping”—are briefly reviewed. Concept mapping consists of connecting words that represent concepts with lines that represent relationships and then labeling the lines. Wait time is waiting three to five seconds between asking a group of students a question and calling on a student to answer or waiting three to five seconds before responding to the student’s answer. © 1988 Association of American Medical Colleges.

AB  - Today's work may very well encompass team work through direct contact with other workers. However, an evolution in the way we work together is taking place. The INTERNET, groupware, video teleconferencing, and distance learning are just some of the examples of collaborative technologies being inserted in the marketplace. Real world environments still include face-to-face transactions but now increasingly encompass distributed electronic transactions facilitated through computing/video media. Human factors - as an interdisciplinary science - may not have been sufficiently developed to move toward a macro-view of collaborative technology. As a result, human factors analysis of 'team error' may have been nearsighted and shallow. Also such analyses - if completed at all - tend to emanate from a traditional cognitive psychology bias. In turn, the paper develops an alternative perspective utilizing ecological psychology to study and interpret human interaction within collaborative systems. From that perspective, the creation of a 'Living Laboratory' is explored whereupon three paradigms to study collaborative processes are presented. Associated assessment tools (e.g., concept mapping and protocol analysis) are discussed as catalysts to synergize this perspective. Implications highlight the 'Living Laboratory' as a vehicle to inform the development of a prototype ecological group interface.

AB  - This study examined the concurrent validity of concept maps as vehicles for documenting and exploring conceptual change in biology. Students (N = 91) who enrolled in an elementary science methods course were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups. Subjects in both groups were administered a multiple‐choice/free‐response inventory which assayed their knowledge of “Life Zones in the Ocean,” and then were asked to construct a concept map on the same topic. Those in the experimental group subsequently received 45 minutes of computer‐assisted instruction on marine life zones, while those in the control (“placebo”) group received an equivalent exposure to an unrelated topic (“Body Defenses”). Upon completing the instructional sequence, subjects were again administered the “Life Zones” inventory and asked to develop a postinstruction concept map on marine life zones. The data analysis employed a split plot factorial design with repeated measures. Differences among treatment groups were documented by analysis of variance and chi‐square procedures. Subjects in the experimental group showed evidence of significant and substantial changes in the complexity and prepositional structure of the knowledge base, as revealed in concept maps. No such changes were found in the control group. Results suggest that concept mapping offers a valid and potentially useful technique for documenting and exploring conceptual change in biology.

AB  - To let student teachers evaluate their pre- and Post-instructional ideas, we confronted them with their own ideas on the subject of biotechnology before and after a course with that title. We asked them to compare their own statements before and after the course and used this information for evaluation of the course. The hierarchical concept mapping test has been used for the investigation of associations and reasonings of each student teacher upon the stimulus word ‘biotechnology’. Comments of student teachers have been registered via interviews and written statements. The use of this method as part of a teaching strategy for the improvement of the effectiveness of the course and for the illustration of learning in biology teacher education will be discussed. © 1991, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - This study examined variation in the organization of domain‐specific knowledge by 50 Year‐12 chemistry students and 4 chemistry teachers. The study used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the Pathfinder network‐generating algorithm to investigate individual and group differences in student concepts maps about chemical equilibrium. MDS was used to represent the individual maps in two‐dimensional space, based on the presence or absence of paired propositional links. The resulting separation between maps reflected degree of hierarchical structure, but also reflected independent measures of student achievement. Pathfinder was then used to produce semantic networks from pooled data from high and low achievement groups using proximity matrices derived from the frequencies of paired concepts. The network constructed from maps of higher achievers (coherence measure = 0.18, linked pairs = 294, and number of subjects = 32) showed greater coherence, more concordance in specific paired links, more important specific conceptual relationships, and greater hierarchical organization than did the network constructed from maps of lower achievers (coherence measure = 0.12, linked pairs = 552, and number of subjects = 22). These differences are interpreted in terms of qualitative variation in knowledge organization by two groups of individuals with different levels of relative expertise (as reflected in achievement scores) concerning the topic of chemical equilibrium. The results suggest that the technique of transforming paired links in concept maps into proximity matrices for input to multivariate analyses provides a suitable methodology for comparing and documenting changes in the organization and structure of conceptual knowledge within and between individual students.

AB  - Problem solving is an enduring issue in science education, ostensibly because science in itself, is basically concerned with problem solving—exploring the universe and seeking answers to intriguing phenomena in nature. Remarkable strides have been made in psychology about recording the minutiae of problem solving as a cognitive process. Concept mapping, a meta-learning tool, is appearing on the scene as a potential pathway for promoting the acquisition of problem-solving skills. Drawing 40 subjects from a pool of students who experienced cooperative and individualistic concept-mapping experiences for six months and adjudged to be good concept mappers, this study found the concept-mapping group to be significantly more successful in solving three biological problems than 20 subjects who served as control. Written and think-aloud procedures and interviews were conducted as part of the administration of the Biology Problem Solving Test. No statistically significant difference was found between students who mapped concepts cooperatively and those who mapped individually. There were mixed results for gender. The implications of the findings for further research and for improving problem-solving abilities of students are drawn. © 1992, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - This article reports on the results of a project that studied the effectiveness of two specific learning heuristics, concept mapping and Vee mapping, in helping black, inner‐city, high school students learn biology concepts meaningfully. The project sought to assess the effects on achievement of the use of these two heuristics as part of a carefully designed sequence of instruction. Two instructional treatments were compared, one that utilized the two experimental heuristics as study aids and one that utilized outlining as a comparison study aid. The instructional treatments were administered over approximately a one semester period. Two hundred and fifty subjects, nearly all black, from two urban high schools in Indiana took part in the study. Achievement instruments designed to measure meaningful (higher order) learning were developed. Analysis of variance of the achievement test means failed to reveal statistically significant differences between the experimental and comparison treatment at the 0.05 alpha level. However, there were suggestions of a tendency toward an effect of the experimental treatment, and several factors contributing to the difficulty in distinguishing achievement differences were identified.

AB  - Eleven elementary science texts commonly used in the nation's schools were examined in terms of conceptual structure and reasoning demands of the texts. Specifically, one primary level (K–3) unit was randomly selected for analysis. Concept maps were drawn and evaluated, and the propositions between concepts were examined in terms of the Piagetian mental schema needed for comprehension. Results show that (1) concept maps and therefore the conceptual structures for a unit on air and/or weather vary widely across texts; (2) all but two conceptual structures are well defined, in that a single concept or group of concepts is not isolated from the total framework; (3) the reasoning needed to comprehend the between‐individual concepts is concrete, in that classificational, interactional, and direct observational reasoning are necessary; and (4) these reasoning demands are above the developmental capabilities of a large segment of primary‐level children, who function in the preoperational stage. Discussion of the results focuses on the kind of science that is appropriate for primary‐level youngsters. Copyright © 1989 Wiley Periodicals, Inc., A Wiley Company

AB  - After reviewing the uses made of conceptmaps in research, as an aid to instruction and as a form of assessment, the problems of scoring maps objectively are discussed. Maps created de novo by 15‐16 year‐old pupils, before and after their introduction to Mendelian genetics, are used to investigate the properties of a scoring system based on that developed by Novak (1983). The maps have been scored separately for a number of features 'branching’, ‘general to specific’, ‘closed units’, ‘terminology’, ‘relationships ’ and ‘ hierarchy ‘ and compared with performance on genetics examination‐type questions. The components are not all independent, and do not have strong relationships with performance. The limitations of analytic methods of scoring concept maps are discussed. © 1985 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Direct teaching of problem‐solving methods to high school physics students met with little success. Expert problem solving depended upon an organized knowledge base. Concept mapping was found to be a key to organizing an effective knowledge base. The investigation of the effect of the degree of concept mapping on achievement was the purpose of this study. Six intact high school physics classes, taught by this investigator, took part in the study. Two classes were control groups and received standard instruction. Four classes received six weeks of concept‐mapping instruction prior to the unit under study. Two of these four classes were the low‐level treatment group and were required to submit concept maps at the conclusion of the instruction. The other two classes were the high‐level treatment group and were required to submit concept maps at the beginning and at the conclusion of the unit under study. One class from each treatment group took a pretest prior to instruction. An analysis of the posttest results revealed no pretest sensitization. A one‐way analysis of covariance indicated a significant main effect for the treatment level at the p < 0.05 level. A pair of single‐df comparisons of the adjusted treatment means resulted in significant differences (p < 0.05) between the control group and the average of the treatment means as well as between the two experimental groups. It can be concluded that for this sample (upper‐middle‐class high school physics students) mapping concepts prior to, during, and subsequent to instruction led to greater achievement as measured by posttest scores.

AB  - This article initially outlines a procedure used to develop a written diagnostic instrument to identify grade‐11 and ‐12 students' misconceptions and misunderstandings of the chemistry topic covalent bonding and structure. The content to be taught was carefully defined through a concept map and propositional statements. Following instruction, student understanding of the topic was identified from interviews, student‐drawn concept maps, and free‐response questions. These data were used to produce 15 two‐tier multiple‐choice items where the first tier examined content knowledge and the second examined understanding of that knowledge in six conceptual areas, namely, bond polarity, molecular shape, polarity of molecules, lattices, intermolecular forces, and the octet rule. The diagnostic instrument was administered to a total of 243 grade‐11 and ‐12 chemistry students and has a Cronbach alpha reliability of 0.73. Item difficulties ranged from 0.13 to 0.60; discrimination values ranged from 0.32 to 0.65. Each item was analyzed to ascertain student understanding of and identify misconceptions related to the concepts and propositional statements underlying covalent bonding and structure.

AB  - This paper reports a study of senior high‐school students’ understandings of concepts related to acids and bases. The methodology was grounded on a concept mapconstructed from the curriculum. This map was used in the design of a multiple‐choice test and of clinical interviews. It was also used in the analysis of the data, and inconstructing concept maps for each participant. The methodology and the resulting analyses are illustrated with two abbreviated cases selected from the study. It is shown that these participants hold idiosyncratic concepts not consistently coincident with those of the prescribed curriculum, and that everyday concepts are retained more than are scientificconcepts. Discussion of concept mapping points to how it starkly represents gaps in the understanding of concepts that are interrelated. This feature of the methodological approach is shown to be significant to the study of students’ conceptions when the subject‐matter concepts are theoretically linked. © 1991 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - Although concept mapping has been shown to help students in meaningful learning, particularly when done as a collaborative activity, little has been done to understand the microprocesses during the activity itself. However, in order to be able to improve the activity as a teaching and learning heuristic, we have to know more about the microprocesses that constitute concept mapping as process and as product. This study was designed to investigate concept mapping as a means of assessing the quality of student understanding from two perspectives: the analysis of the process of constructing meaning and the analysis of the products of this cognitive activity. An interpretive research methodology was adopted for the construction of meaning from the data. Twenty‐nine students from two sections of a senior level high school physics course participated in the study. The data sources included videotapes, their transcripts, and all concept maps produced. Students worked in collaborative groups during all of the concept mapping sessions. Individual concept mapping was assessed twice, once delayed by a week, another time delayed by 6 weeks. To assess what happened to the cognitive achievement as the context of concept mapping changed from collaborative to individual activity, we used a tracer. A tracer is some bit of knowledge, procedure, or action that allows the researcher to follow a task through various settings. The concept maps as products differed in their hierarchical organization, the number of links, and the benefit to the individual students. Three major processes emerged, which students used to arrive at suitable propositions. Students mediated propositions verbally and nonverbally, they took adversarial positions and appealed to authority, and they formed temporary alliances based on presumed expertise. Both product and process hold promise but also show some limitations. On the positive side, concept mapping led to sustained discourse on the topic and improved the declarative knowledge of several students both in terms of the hierarchical organization and “local” configuration of the concepts. In contrast, concept mapping also let unintended and scientifically incorrect notions become ingrained and go unchallenged. On the basis of the outcomes of our study we formulated specific recommendations for the use of concept maps in the classroom. These include continued instruction in establishing proper hierarchies and cross‐links to increase the quality of the concept maps' structure and the number of high quality links. Then, instruction should facilitate students' attempts to reflect on the nature of the relationships expressed in their maps. And finally, specific roles could be assigned to individual students to improve the overall quality of the process of constructing the map and, thus, of the final product.

AB  - An innovative, conceptually based instructional model for teaching large undergraduate astronomy courses was designed, implemented, and evaluated in the Fall 1995 semester. This model was based on cognitive and educational theories of knowledge and, we believe, is applicable to other large postsecondary science courses. Major components were: (a) identification of the basic important concepts and their interrelationships that are necessary for connected understanding of astronomy in novice students; (b) use of these concepts and their interrelationships throughout the design, implementation, and evaluation stages of the model; (c) identification of students' prior knowledge and misconceptions; and (d) implementation of varied instructional strategies targeted toward encouraging conceptual understanding in students (i.e., instructional concept maps, cooperative small group work, homework assignments stressing concept application, and a conceptually based student assessment system). Evaluation included the development and use of three measures of conceptual understanding and one of attitudes toward studying astronomy. Over the semester, students showed very large increases in their understanding as assessed by a conceptually based multiple-choice measure of misconceptions, a select-and-fill-in concept map measure, and a relatedness-ratings measure. Attitudes, which were slightly positive before the course, changed slightly in a less favorable direction. © 1997 American Association of Physics Teachers.

AB  - Concept mapping has been used effectively to represent understanding of a field of knowledge. The maps are highly individualistic and idiosyncratic. Three high-performing junior college students, three average performing junior college students and two university physics teachers constructed maps using 22 electricity concepts. In this study several previously used and newly developed measures were applied to the maps in an attempt to gain further insight into differences in the quality of understanding of the three groups. It was found that the concept maps constructed by high performing students differed from those of average performing students and closely resembled the concept maps of physics experts, especially when the quality of the links between concepts was taken into account. © 1993, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The procedures devised for mapping and evaluating maps has been applied to a number of different topic areas both for senior chemistry and for junior science. We believe that this procedure for constructing concept maps is more comprehensive and facilitates student use better than previous procedures. The procedure for evaluating concept maps has also been refined to the point whereby the classroom teacher can readily apply it as part of his/her teaching strategy. The research for this paper further supports concept mapping both as an instructional and evaluative tool. © 1981 Australian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - How can a teacher quickly gain a useful insight into a pupil’s present ideas? How can he discern the major connections in the learner’s existing thought content? This article discusses several different approaches. It examines the theoretical assumptions underlying them and considers how easily they could be adapted in the classroom as part of a diagnostic approach to teaching. The author suggests a more explicit distinction between the publicly agreed version of a scientific concept and the multiple private versions held by individuals. Learning can then be viewed as development and change of thé latter, as words (concept labels) change or extend their meanings. The teacher’s role is at first that of a diagnostician who tries to describe the learner’s existing private concept. Later he may see himself as provocateur of its changes and extensions. It is also argued that terms such as ‘cognitive structure’ and ‘concept map’ do not adequately represent the fluidity of thought in which the changes occur. Any useful conceptualization of how a learner’s thought is organized must include some picture of its dynamics as well as its statics. Nevertheless some of the methods reviewed could be adapted in the classroom and might enhance the effectiveness of both teaching and learning. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

AB  - The physiological and chemical properties of haemoglobin have been investigated for some seventy years, culminating in the atomic model proposed by M. F. Perutz in 1968. The present paper uses the model and the description of the oxygenation mechanism proposed by Perutz in 1970 as a teaching principle to illustrate the relationship between structure and function at the molecular level for undergraduate and HNC students. The evidence used to explain the properties of normal and abnormal haemoglobin molecules is summarised. Some suggestions are made for practical exercises to illustrate the topic, arising out of the author's experience of teaching medical laboratory science to HNC students. A sequential presentation of the properties of haemoglobin is given in the form of a concept map and an attempt is made to arrange these concepts into a hierarchy after the manner of R. M. Gagne. This leads to a consideration of pre-requisite knowledge in biochemistry and raises the problem of what is relevant for the understanding of advanced concepts by medical and para-medical students. Some evidence pertaining to the use of D. P. Ausubel's “advance organisers” is summarised and some suggestions offered as to how their value could be investigated in the present context. Finally, H. T. Epstein's research paper method of teaching is considered. In this, it is claimed that learning is facilitated by reading and discussing a series of research papers on a topic and by predicting, in advance, what investigations would be necessary to solve the problem. The present author lists a series of papers which could be used for testing this mode of teaching. © 1974, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.

AB  - In conclusion the results indicate that, in the early grades of the secondary school, the wide range of terms introduced into the teaching of science not only to maintain the precision of the discipline, but also to arouse the interest of pupils, need not be too limited. Satiation of the pupils' abilities to assimilate the concepts and to manipulate them in thinking can be overcome by presentation with explanations. Further, an inference can be drawn from the evidence that the introduction of explained concepts increases the learning of pupils. The results have been applied in the training of a limited sample of beginning science teachers. After viewing demonstration tapes and discussing results the trainees exhibited increased interest and willingness to spend time in analysing their language and to use concept-mapping as pre-lesson aids to improvement. © 1981 Australian Science Education Research Association.

AB  - We are convinced that the concept map can be a valuable tool in curriculum, instruction, and evaluation. We look forward to seeing some of the suggested concept mapping techniques (as well as others) tested and used by others in order to add empirical validity to the idea of concept mapping, because we view these procedures as an important link between learning theory and teaching. We invite biology teachers to produce their own maps and share them with us. © 1979, National Association of Biology Teachers. All rights reserved.

AB  - Flow diagrams, algorithms, decision logic tables, and concept maps are presented as methods for teaching practical procedures, problem solving, and basic concepts in microbial genetics. For practical procedures the aim is to present the sequence of operations clearly, to diagnose and correct possible errors, and to encourage the student to design investigations efficiently. Procedures for problem solving are discussed which give a logical sequence of questions with yes/no answers leading to a finite number of possible solutions. The use of concept maps in the planning of courses and in illustrating the relationships between different aspects of microbial genetics is discussed. It is suggested that the flexible use of these methods should lead to an improved understanding of microbial genetics. © 1977, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. All rights reserved.
