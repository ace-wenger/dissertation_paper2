AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in a non-programming manner. In this work, we examine the use of the peer review process in early, object-oriented, computer science courses as a way to develop the reviewers' knowledge of object-oriented programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation.
   To study these ideas, we used peer review exercises in two CS2 classes at local universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding exercises), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs. Overall, peer reviews are a valuable method for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative way to learn object-oriented programming concepts.

AB  - The methodological work in the year group constitutes the strategic process of planning, organizing, directing and controlling the educational teaching process to achieve continuous improvement and the satisfaction of the interested parties. In the groups of academic years, the main teachers of the year (highest authority) have the need to manage them through the process approach to take advantage of this with respect to the current functional approach that is presented in Higher Education. The research aims to analyze the methodological work in groups of academic years with a process approach. For this, a conceptual analysis of the methodological work is carried out and it is designed through the process map, the deployment and the flow diagram. Empirical methods such as observation, interviews and surveys were also used. During the development of the research, different softwares were used, among which are: Statistic Program for Social Sciences (SPSS) for the processing of surveys, UCINET in the analysis of social networks and MindManager X5 in the elaboration of concept maps.

AB  - As faculty, our goals for students are often tacit, hidden not only from students but from ourselves as well. We present a conceptual framework for considering teaching goals - what we want our students to achieve - that encourages us to think more broadly about what we mean by achieving in our knowledge domains. This framework includes declarative knowledge ("knowing that"), procedural knowledge ("knowing how"), schematic knowledge ("knowing why") and strategic knowledge ("knowing when, where and how our knowledge applies"). We link the framework to a variety of assessment methods and focus on assessing the structure of declarative knowledge - knowledge structure. From prior research, we know that experts and knowledgeable students have extensive, well-structured, declarative knowledge; not so novices. We then present two different techniques for assessing knowledge structure - cognitive and concept maps, and a combination of the two - and provide evidence on their technical quality. We show that these maps provide a window into the structure of students' declarative knowledge not otherwise tapped by typical pencil-and-paper tests. These maps provide us with new teaching goals and new evidence on student learning.

AB  - Purpose The ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic is contingent upon the ability to effectively manage its heterogeneous knowledge resources. Knowledge mapping represents a great opportunity to create value by bringing stakeholders together, facilitating comprehensive collaboration and facilitating broader in-depth knowledge sharing and transfer. However, identifying and analysing critical knowledge areas is one of the most important steps when creating a knowledge map. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to appraise the critical knowledge areas for managing COVID-19, and thereby enhance decision-making in tackling the consequences of the pandemic. Design/methodology/approach The methodological approach for this study is a critical literature review, covering publications on knowledge management, knowledge mapping and COVID-19. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, TRID, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library were searched for full text, peer-reviewed articles written in English that investigated on critical knowledge areas for managing the spread of COVID-19. After full screening, 21 articles met the criteria for inclusion and were analysed and reported. Findings The study revealed seven critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. These are cleaning and disinfection; training, education and communication; reporting guidance and updates; testing; infection control measures, personal protective equipment; and potential COVID-19 transmission in health and other care settings. The study developed a concept knowledge map illustrating areas of critical knowledge which decision-makers need to be aware of. Practical implications Providing decision-makers with access to key knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be crucial for effective decision-making. This study has provided insights for the professionals and decision-makers identifying the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. Social implications The study advances the literature on knowledge management and builds a theoretical link with the management of public health emergencies. Additionally, the findings support the theoretical position that knowledge maps facilitate decision-making and help users to identify critical knowledge areas easily and effectively. Originality/value This study fills gaps in the existing literature by providing an explicit representation of know-how for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses an objective and qualitative approach by reviewing related publications, reports and guidelines in the analysis. The concept map illustrates the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic.

AB  - In this study, we developed teaching materials and lesson plans to expand students' understanding of fundamental engineering principles through experimentation with and manufacturing of real products. The products used for this study were a model car and a walking model. With the development of these products as a specific objective and not using special equipment, we aimed to enable students to learn and utilize one of fundamental discipline in engineering, mechanics. The products were introduced in a lecture format class and the effectiveness of the lesson plan was evaluated. Results of the evaluations administered at the beginning and the end of the class showed that the students obtained a greater understanding of mechanics by engaging in the design and production of the two products. Concept maps created by the students showed that through the lesson, they improved their ability to apply scientific knowledge to experimental investigation and manufacturing processes. Moreover, results of a survey questionnaire suggested an improvement in students' aptitude for and confidence in applying scientific knowledge to real problems, including experiments and product manufacturing.

AB  - This article contains results of studies and comparisons of conceptual competence in didactics demonstrated by 115 students future and currently practicing teachers. The article gives an insight into conceptual competence in didactics in terms of strength of mastering the didactic knowledge, structuring this knowledge when solving didactic problems and the ability to freely operate didactic concepts when stating new problems associated with learning process organization and assessment of its results. The article describes the study procedure based on analysis of definitions of didactic concepts (a total of 3487 definitions were processed), 353 concept maps, as well as statements of problems in the educational field (a total of 400 statements were analyzed). The level of conceptual competence in didactics possessed by Russian students and teachers with different educational specialization (primary school, humanitarian sciences, natural sciences, supplementary education) is identified and assessed based on the developed assessment criteria, and the nature of relationship between the level of demonstration of such competence and sources and means of renewing and acquiring didactic information when encountering difficulties.

AB  - This study examines the process by which system thinking perceptions develop within the context of a water cycle curriculum. Four junior high school students undergoing an especially designed inquiry-based intervention were closely observed before, during, immediately after, and 6 years after completing a year long systems-based learning program. The employed research tools included observations, semi-structured interviews, and a number of "concept viewing" tools (drawings, concept maps, and repertory grids). Out of the data, four distinct "stories," each presenting a different way of constructing hydro system mental models, are described. The paper's main conclusion is that students develop their systems mental models and remember the learned material based on learning patterns that tend to remain unchanged over time. Consequently, in order to facilitate efficient and lasting construction of students' system models, learning experiences should harness these, and especially the meta-cognitive learning pattern, which holds special significance for constructing systems.

AB  - Purpose - This study attempts to list and rank the necessary skills required of a global logistics professional based on objective evaluations from industry.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper adopts a novel mixed-methods approach using elements of concept mapping (brainstorming, multidimensional scaling, cluster analysis), and link analysis. Concept mapping through repeated brainstorming by industry practitioners helps to summarize the key skill required of an effective global logistician. The multidimensional scaling method and cluster analysis support the classification and weighting of the capabilities into nine clusters. Link analysis helps to evaluate the significance of the results and addresses the gap between industry and academic perceptions of the existing global logistics curriculum in Taiwan.
   Findings - In dealing with globalization, a logistician needs to be able to integrate, communicate, and analyze from an international perspective, perform financial analysis, maintain good industry and customer relations, exhibit strong people skills, stay healthy, and understand laws and regulations. Significant differences exist between industry practitioners and educators. The former believe that cross-functional marketing skills are critical and emphasize the importance of risk and financial management. In contrast, logistics educators consider the traditional logistics management skills, such as demand forecasting, sourcing, planning, and system integration, as key priorities.
   Research limitations/implications - There is room for research and theory on how to narrow the mismatch between the current logistics curricula in academia and practical requirements. Different pedagogical strategies and techniques can be further investigated to orchestrate an effective and balanced global logistics management course. One research limitation arises from the sample which is confined to Taiwan. Thus, the authors' findings may be constrained by local and cultural influences. Future research could extend to a large-scale multi-country data collection and analysis to reduce the possibility of cultural and context bias.
   Practical implications - Arming students with such important but diverse global logistics skills presents a challenge for logistics educators who need to find the right balance between breadth and depth of the modules. Educators and practitioners need to work closely together to co-design and adapt the logistics curricula for a rapidly changing global environment. This will help to shorten the last stage from the classroom to the workplace by keeping abreast of the changes in industry and produce relevant logisticians without compromising on rigour.
   Originality/value - The results provide a reference for educators keen on blending logistics education course design with practitioner inputs, to better develop global logistics capabilities. It also provides a reference to help prioritize what skills are important to be taught jointly in a module.

AB  - This study describes how a group of grade 7 and 8 students in South Africa engaged with the notion of spatial scale in the Universe before, during and after a visit to an astronomy science centre. A limited amount of research has been conducted on this concept worldwide. Using a combination of concept maps, observations and interviews, results indicate that, despite contrary suggestions in the literature, students aged 13-to 15-years are able to improve their conceptions of size and distance from naive and conflicting knowledge to a more scientific understanding after their visit. The findings also demonstrate, using a human constructivist framework, that students showed both weak and strong restructuring of knowledge. Experiences with size and distance also appeared to be important in the students' affective domain. The paper argues that a combination of related, themed experiences related to spatial scale can account for the improvement, and recommends that these and even more innovative activities should be explicitly promoted at science centres and in out-of-classroom activities.

AB  - This study explores the impact of a STEM integration teacher professional development program focusing on teachers' perception of engineering and their attitudes toward integrating engineering into teaching. A total of sixty-eight teachers from ten schools participated in the program for five days. Data are collected from three main sources including (1) pre and post concept maps probing teachers' perceptions about the engineering discipline, (2) a pre and post survey measuring teachers' self-efficacy of teaching science/mathematics within the engineering context, and (3) engineering integrated science and (or) mathematics lesson plans and teaching reflections. This study utilizes both qualitative and quantitative research methods depending on the data we have collected. The results show that both science and math teachers thought that integrating engineering into teaching provided valuable outcomes, i.e., promoting students' learning about engineering and improving their interest in science or math through real-world problem solving exercises. Participants also felt more comfortable about integrating engineering in their teaching after the program. The results also imply that the teachers' understandings of engineering become more concrete after the program. This study also provides an overview of the challenges and advantages of teaching engineering in K-12 science and mathematics classrooms.

TI  - NSF GRANTEE PRESENTATION: CHALLENGES OF IMPLEMENTING A PEER MENTORING PROGRAM TO SUPPORT STEM LEARNING
T2  - 2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION
CP  - ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition
AB  - The College of Technology - Computer Engineering Technology (CoT - CETE) program at the University of Houston has implemented a peer mentoring model funded through an NSF-sponsored grant supporting undergraduate STEM learning. A group of high achieving seniors were recruited to serve as mentors to students in lower-division laboratories. These mentors were expected to have a high level of technical knowledge and skill and also serve as guides and role models for their mentees. To support this process, training for the mentors was adapted from a peer-led team learning program and incorporated concept mapping as a primary pedagogical tool for increasing mentee understanding of key concepts. Over the course of a two-year implementation, mentors faced several challenges that undercut the impact of the mentoring sessions. Ultimately, faculty had to redesign the peer-mentor model to address these challenges and improve the potential efficacy of the program. This paper discusses the challenges faced by mentors and lessons learned during the project implementation.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION
KW  - TEXT
AB  - This experimental study explores how 60 primary-age children's ( 9-11 years old) understanding of rocks was effected by instruction that used the conceptual structure of the rock cycle together with the analogy of aluminium can recycling. Using a combination of probes into children's understanding, including concept maps and semi-structured interviews, changes to the content of their knowledge ( description and classification of rocks) as categorized by membership of particular hierarchical explanatory frameworks ( constructed from children's preintervention responses), and how such knowledge appears be organized into possible networks of information, are described. Results are then discussed in terms of the impact of the rock cycle, with or without the use of the analogy, on children's existing conceptions, followed by observations on the positive role of the analogy in supporting understanding. In conclusion, the implications for the nature of cognitive change in this domain as revealed by children's explanatory frameworks and the potential value of the aluminium can analogy in supporting children's understanding are addressed.

AB  - This research aims to develop oxidation-reduction reactions (redox) teaching material used the Four Steps Teaching Material Development (4S TMD) method consists of four steps: selection, structuring, characterization and didactical reduction. This paper is the first part of the development of teaching material that includes selection and structuring steps. At the selection step, the development of teaching material begins with the development concept of redox based on curriculum demands, then the development of fundamental concepts sourced from the international textbook, and last is the development of values or skills can be integrated with redox concepts. The results of this selection step are the subject matter of the redox concept and values can be integrated with it. In the structuring step was developed concept map that provide on the relationship between redox concepts; Macro structure that guide systematic on the writing of teaching material; And multiple representations which are the development of teaching material that connection between macroscopic, submicroscopic, and symbolic level representations. The result of the two steps in this first part of the study produced a draft of teaching material. Evaluation of the draft of teaching material is done by an expert lecturer in the field of chemical education to assess the feasibility of teaching material.

AB  - Aim. Review and analysis of available articles focused on factors affecting development of nursing students critical thinking.
   Material and methods. Integrative review of articles published between 2011 and 2021, available in the electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and EBSCO. Searching was based on keywords "critical thinking", "nursing", "nursing care", "nursing education" which were connected by Boolean logic operators "and" as well as "or".
   Results. There are several factors significant to advancement of critical thinking. Prevalent teaching methods, which promote development of critical thinking, constitute active learning strategies, concept mapping, simulation, problem-based learning, case study and learning methods based on evidence. Moreover, cultural and individual factors like empathy, emotional intelligence and caring behaviour show a significant relationship with critical thinking.
   Conclusions. Critical thinking represents an important meta-competence for nurses. Critical thinking contributes to adequate gathering of the information about patient, selection of those and formulating accurate diagnoses, progression of problem-solving skills and making decisions, improves communication with the patient. Analysis of relevant literature made it possible to indicate factors affecting critical thinking.

T2  - SCIENCE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH: FORGING A PATH TO THE FUTURE
CP  - 121st Annual Meeting of the Astronomical-Society-of-the-Pacific
AB  - NASA, NSF and other funding organizations support science education and outreach to achieve their broader impact goals. Organizations like ASP and the NSF Research Centers Educators Network (NRCEN) are building networks of education and public outreach (EPO) professionals to enhance programmatic success in reaching these goals. As the professionals who provide these programs to the various scientific communities, we are often the key connectors between investigators at cutting-edge research centers, the education world and the public. However, our profession does not have strong ties for sharing best practices across the different scientific disciplines. To develop those ties, we need to identify our common interests and build on them by sharing lessons learned and best practices. We will use the technique of concept mapping to develop a schematic of how each of us addresses our broader impact goals and discuss the common and divergent features. We will also present the education and outreach logic model that was recently developed by the 27 Education Directors of NSF-funded Materials Research Science and Engineering Centers (MRSEC). Building on this information, we will collaboratively develop a list of key areas of similar interest between ASP and NRCEN EPO professionals.

AB  - The purpose of this 4-year research study was to develop paper-and-pencil tests that could be administered to a wide range of students in order to establish a database about students' physics conceptions from elementary school to high school levels in Taiwan. The students' misconceptions of mechanics, electricity and magnetism, heat, sound and wave, and optics were diagnosed. In the beginning of this study, we extensively reviewed the research literature on related conceptions. With the use of concept maps and related propositional statements, we also interviewed some students to find out their conceptual understanding of the selected key concepts. These data provided sufficient information about students' thoughts of several concepts. Through a process of developing two-tier test items, nine versions of physics questionnaires were obtained. More than 13,000 students were randomly sampled in a national survey. After data analysis, the results indicated that students' misconceptions in physics such as the image formed by lenses and mirrors and the torque and rotational motion were consistent with their ages. However, in some cases, such as the current in an electric circuit, students' understandings of concepts did not improve with age.

AB  - This paper presents a qualitative study conducted using the Glaserian grounded theory (GT) method. Glaser's approach to GT differs from Strauss and Corbin's method, which is more widespread. There are some differences in the focus on participants' concerns, staying in the research environment for an extended period to discover participants' main concerns and the emergence of a basic social process around the core category. The Glaserian GT method was used to understand elite athletes' lifestyles. Two groups of athletes and non-athletes were recruited for the interview as the sample. The core category was determined through iterative coding, memoing, theoretical sampling, and theoretical sorting. There were overlaps in these phases; they fluctuated back and forth and were not as clear-cut as they could be. Results showed the lifestyle components of elite athletes. Besides identifying participants' main concerns, the results also demonstrated how to address them over time. It is a category of a basic social process named "professionalizing." Lastly, the steps of creating a concept map are explained practically, which in addition to sports science scholars, can be considered by researchers in other fields.

AB  - Context-based education, in which students deal with biological concepts in a meaningful way, is showing promise in promoting the development of students' conceptual coherence. However, literature gives little guidance about how this kind of education should be designed. Therefore, our study aims at designing and evaluating the practicability of a context-based biology lesson sequence. Four design principles for conceptual coherence were defined: build upon familiar concepts; focus on core concepts; stimulate establishing connections between concepts; and reflect on these connections. These design principles have been elaborated into a lesson sequence about concepts related to cellular metabolism and the relevant connections between the concepts have been visualised in a reference concept map. The activities of teacher and students that were expected to contribute in establishing these connections were described in a research scenario. The lesson sequence was conducted in a 10th-grade class of 21 students, aged 15-16, in senior general secondary education. Data were collected from video-recordings in the classroom. The observed activities of the teacher and students were compared with the intended activities. The findings show that a research scenario is a powerful tool to systematically evaluate the design and to provide information for improving it.

AB  - This work presents the design, development, testing and validation of a Photonic Virtual Laboratory, highlighting the study of LEDs. The study was conducted from a conceptual, experimental and didactic standpoint, using e-learning and m-learning platforms. Specifically, teaching tools that help ensure that our students perform significant learning have been developed. It has been brought together the scientific aspect, such as the study of LEDs, with techniques of generation and transfer of knowledge through the selection, hierarchization and structuring of information using concept maps. For the validation of the didactic materials developed, it has been used procedures with various assessment tools for the collection and processing of data, applied in the context of an experimental design. Additionally, it was performed a statistical analysis to determine the validity of the materials developed. The assessment has been designed to validate the contributions of the new materials developed over the traditional method of teaching, and to quantify the learning achieved by students, in order to draw conclusions that serve as a reference for its application in the teaching and learning processes, and comprehensively validate the work carried out.

AB  - This study aimed to determine how 33 urban 5th grade students' science conceptions changed during a place-based inquiry unit on watersheds. Research on watershed and place-based education was used as it framework to guide the teaching of the unit as well as the research study. A teacher-researcher designed the curriculum, taught the unit and conducted the research using qualitative data sources such as concept maps, science notebooks and interviews. Most students came to understand that their watershed was part of an urban environment where water drains from the surrounding land into a body of water. Thus. they began to understand how urban land use affects water quality. This study provides evidence for the use of place-based learning in developing students' knowledge of the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996) and watersheds. Implications of this study include the use of place-based learning in urban settings and the experiences needed for students to conceptualize watersheds. (C) 2009 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

TI  - Views of German chemistry teachers on creativity in chemistry classes and in general
T2  - CHEMISTRY EDUCATION RESEARCH AND PRACTICE
KW  - EDUCATION
AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important competence in today's rapidly changing times, because economics and industries depend on innovation. Creativity is therefore a requirement for school graduates, especially for the ones who strive to pursue a technical or scientific career. But creativity has not been integrated into the curricula of STEM subjects in many European countries like Germany. To successfully integrate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers' views and conceptions on creativity, because they have an influence on teaching and lesson planning. This is the purpose of this study. To investigate the views and conceptions, a research instrument especially designed for this study is used. It includes the creation of two concept maps and filling out a questionnaire. The study was carried out using fifteen German chemistry teachers. The evaluation of the data was made qualitatively as well as quantitatively. It has revealed that almost all of the teachers in this study had a positive attitude towards creativity and had experiences referring to integrating creativity into their own chemistry lessons. But not all of these experiences are good ones and there were some aspects with regard to creativity in general, where uncertainties could be identified.

AB  - In recent decades, internationalization within higher education has emerged as a distinct field for practice and research. However, there are few meta-analyses of how the research trends and foci of this topic have evolved and shifted over time. This article analyzes the content of the Journal of Studies in International Education (JSIE), a central outlet for internationalization research, thus shedding light on overarching developments and trends within the field. In this investigation, the text-mining tool Leximancer is used to generate concept maps based on the titles and abstracts of all 406 scientific articles published in the JSIE between 1997 and 2016 (first issue). Four major developmental waves in this research area are revealed: delineation of the field (1997-2001), institutionalization and management of internationalization (2002-2006), consequences of internationalization: student needs and support structures (2007-2011), and currently, moving from the institutional to the transnational context of internationalization (2012-2016). The results show how the meaning of the concept has evolved to encapsulate several other related concepts in research on higher education, while reporting practices toward internationalization at individual, institutional, and national levels.

TI  - A WINDOW INTO THINKING - USING STUDENT WRITING TO UNDERSTAND CONCEPTUAL CHANGE IN SCIENCE LEARNING
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
KW  - KNOWLEDGE
AB  - This study, conducted in an inner-city middle school, followed the conceptual changes shown in 25 students' writing over a 12-week science unit. Conceptual changes for 6 target students are reported. Student understanding was assessed regarding the nature of matter and physical change by paper-and-pencil pretest and posttest. The 6 target students were interviewed about the goal concepts before and after instruction. Students' writing during lesson activities provided qualitative data about their understandings of the goal concepts across the science unit. The researcher constructed concept maps from students' written statements and compared the maps across time to assess changes in the schema of core concepts, complexity, and organization as a result of instruction. Target students' changes were studied in detail to determine patterns of conceptual change. After patterns were located in target students' maps, the remaining 19 students' maps were analyzed for similar patterns. The ideas that students identified in their writing showed changes in central concepts, complexity, and organization as the lessons progressed. When instructional events were analyzed in relation to students' demonstrated ideas, understanding of the goal conceptions appeared in students' writing more often when students had opportunities to explain their new ideas orally and in writing.

AB  - Research into students' conceptions is inherently challenged with appropriately transferring profound research questions into suitable research instruments. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to studies with primary school students. In order to investigate individuals' conceptions, besides linear-linguistic questionnaire procedures, classically guided interviews are used, also triangulated with each other or further sub-instruments (e.g. concept mapping techniques). For this latter purpose, seek-and-find-drawings offer a good opportunity, both paper based and digital. This paper presents research on primary school students' conceptions of computers in everyday objects and illustrates a methodical opportunity regarding the use of seek-and-find-drawings in Computer Science Education research. In the presented study, 60 primary school children were presented with a seek-and-find-drawing depicting several everyday encounter situations with computing systems. According to the results, primary school students understand not only personal computers, smartphones, tablets, video gaming consoles and (video) cameras, but in few cases also refrigerators, air conditioners and cars as systems containing (embedded) computers. The experience from the presented paper based hidden objects study can be used especially for future research projects.

AB  - This study aimed to diagnose the cognitive structure of university science pupils regarding the topic energy relationships and energy flow in organisms. The study was carried Out using a word association test on 150 students studying at the Selcuk University. A word association test comprising 10 key concepts 'sunlight energy, photosynthesis, respiration, producer, consumer, separator, oxygen, carbon dioxide, ATP, glucose' was applied to the students, and concept maps were drawn according to the frequency table prepared from the answers given to the chosen key concepts. It is seen that the highest number of associations are, in descending order, Sunlight - photosynthesis, producer - plants and discriminator saprophyte. Although the students have responded to all the key concepts, it Could be observed that they do not perceive the relationship between the concepts as a complete network. From this result, it is apparent that students experience very limited cognitive learning during their education. The proposal was developed on the importance of research results from the perspective of biology education, and the use of word association tests as all educational tool.

AB  - Throughout an information search, a user needs to make sense of the information found to create an understanding. This requires cognitive effort that can be demanding. Building on prior sensemaking models and expanding them with ideas from learning and cognitive psychology, we examined the use of cognitive mechanisms during individual sensemaking. We conducted a qualitative user study of 15 students who searched for and made sense of information for business analysis and news writing tasks. Through the analysis of think-aloud protocols, recordings of screen movements, intermediate work products of sensemaking, including notes and concept maps, and final reports, we observed the use of 17 data-driven and structure-driven mechanisms for processing new information, examining individual concepts and relationships, and detecting anomalies. These cognitive mechanisms, as the basic operators that move sensemaking forward, provide in-depth understanding of how people process information to produce sense. Meaningful learning and sensemaking are closely related, so our findings apply to learning as well. Our results contribute to a better understanding of the sensemaking process-how people think-and this better understanding can inform the teaching of thinking skills and the design of improved sensemaking assistants and mind tools.

AB  - As the Baby Boomer generation reaches old age, there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults needing healthcare over the past decade. The physiology of aging is therefore a highly relevant topic for the preclinical medical curriculum. I describe a new capstone unit on the physiology of aging, placed at the end a medical physiology course, to provide a vehicle for integration of prior learning about physiology of each individual body system. Students were provided with online self-study modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a "Review of Systems" predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components.

AB  - Knowledge integration involves pulling together ideas and information into a coherent framework such that new ideas can be linked into already established ideas, and groups of ideas can be mobilized for solving problems, answering questions, or understanding observations. Geoscientists are called on to integrate information from many different modes of inquiry, across different cultural and scientific traditions, in the face of incomplete evidence and in support of ill-structured problems. This paper explores five strategies to foster knowledge integration through geoscience education: three organizational schemas for content, plus two integrative practices. These are (1) integrate around a locale of significance to students, (2) integrate around a societally important problem, (3) integrate around a suite of "big ideas," (4) integrate using visual representations, and (5) integrate using physical and computer models. For each strategy, we describe examples of its use in geoscience education, critique advantages and potential disadvantages, and suggest questions for future research. We conclude with a thought experiment envisioning the nodes and linkages in hypothetical mental concept maps of students educated with each of these five strategies, seeking to improve on a fragmented mental map of isolated nodes and weak linkages.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to explain prospective science and technology teachers' pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) about the cell. Lesson preparation, laboratory plan, interview with teacher candidates, and concept mapping were used to collect the data for prospective teacher's PCK. The study was conducted with six prospective science and technology teachers in the spring of 2006-2007 in Pamukkale University-Turkey. We aimed to identify the content and structure of the PCK for a topic on cell, describing the PCK in terms of relations between four different aspects: Knowledge about science and technology curriculum, belief about subject matter knowledge, knowledge about students' understanding; knowledge about assessment of students. According to the result of the study, pre-service teacher's knowledge inaccurate special teaching methods, they used a teacher-centered approach, and also they have a high belief of subject matter knowledge. Based on the result of this study, which were discussed in the light of national and international literature, we have suggestions for further researchers, curriculum developers, and science and technological teacher educators.

AB  - Since the first reports of the Covid-19 virus in December 2019, the tourism industry has struggled to find solutions to this unprecedented crisis. During crises, organizational learning can develop crisis management and communication skills while enhancing organizational resilience in coping with crises. This research examines whether organizational learning for communicating during crises occurred in the Swiss hotel industry in the past 2 years. By tracking and visualizing the messages communicated by Swiss hotels on their websites, this study analyzes the communication strategies employed by hoteliers over the past 20 months through thematic analysis, co-occurrence analysis, and Situational Crisis Communication (SCCT) strategies. The results of this study identified the evolution of communication strategies over time. Specifically, ingratiation, corrective action, transferring, victimization, and justification are the five key strategies. This study also visualizes the crisis responses in concept maps in three snapshots (June 2020, June 2021, and February 2022). The concepts and colors of the visualization provide a different perspective on the evolution of crisis communication over the past 2 years. This study contributes to academia and practitioners by demonstrating the evolution of crisis communication messages through both the granular analysis of SCCT strategies and the bird's-eye view of themes and concepts.

AB  - This article presents a diachronic study in which the conceptions of university students on the specifc areas of Social Education through the elaboration of collaborative multimedia concept maps are analyzed. The sample consists of 321 students belonging to the Social Education and Dual Degree Social Education and Social Work Degree courses of the Universidad Pablo de Olavide, during the academic years 2014/15, 2015/16 and 2016/17. Through a qualitative methodology, through virtual ethnography and quantitative techniques with the use of questionnaires, we analyzed the intervention areas in Social Education and the most signifcant results were the following: drug addiction (16%), people with disabilities and mental health problems (13%), elderly (13%), and childhood (9%). Other areas that students have identifed as being specifc to Social Education are: immigration and adults (7%), adolescence (6%), gender violence (5%), socio-community care (4%), sociocultural animation and labor integration 3%), as well as judicial measures, social integration and exclusion (2%), homelessness, child violence, family mediation, education, street education, interculturality, or child violence (1%). In order to point out these concepts, multimedia conceptual maps have been elaborated which show fundamentaly through a vertical hierarchical arrangement.

This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject's body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research.

AB  - A VLE is a system where three main actors can be devised: the student in the role of instructional designer, the tutor, and the student. Instructional designers need easy interaction for specifying the course domain structure to the system, and for controlling how well the learning materials agree to such a structure. Tutors need tools for having a holistic perception of the evolution of single students and/or groups in the VLE during the learning process. Finally, students need self regulation in terms of controlling their learning rate, reflect on their learning strategies, and comparing with other people in the class. In this work we claim that sharing an implicit representation of the knowledge about the course domain between all these actors can meet the requirements stated before, and we present a tool that has been developed as part of the I-TUTOR project according to our claim. The tool analyses a suitable document corpus describing the course domain, and generates a semantic space, which in turn is displayed as a 2D zoomable map. All the relevant concepts of the domain are depicted in the map, and learning materials can be browsed through the tool. Also the texts generated by students during the learning process as well as their social activities inside the VLE can be placed in the map. The motivations of the work are reported as well as the underlying AI techniques, and the whole system is explained in detail along with the evaluation performed during the project.

AB  - This study aimed to identify what male coaches of elite female team sport athletes want to know about the menstrual cycle and its influence on athlete health and performance. Using a mixed-methods concept mapping approach, 18 male coaches of Australian female elite football-codes brainstormed what they wanted to know about the menstrual cycle to work more effectively with female athletes. Ideas were sorted into groups of similar ideas and rated for importance and influence. Thirty-eight unique statements emerged from the brainstorming. These were organised into five clusters/topics following multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis: 1) How does training need to be managed; 2) How is physical performance impacted; 3) What are the medical and dietary considerations; 4) When and how should we communicate with athletes; and 5) How are athletes affected psychologically and emotionally. These findings highlight the need for a comprehensive education framework to improve the knowledge of and practices related to the menstrual cycle. This education should 1) facilitate better recognition and referral of female athletes regarding menstrual cycle dysfunction and related health concerns; 2) encourage collaboration between athletes, coaches, and medical and dietary professionals; and 3) promote effective communication between athletes and coaches about the menstrual cycle.

AB  - Young people's unemployment and underemployment are acknowledged as serious and enduring problems in Australia and globally. Construction is one of the largest employers of young people, and social procurement of construction products and services has significant potential if harnessed to address this problem. This article argues that project-based intermediation offers critical new insights into how social procurement can be implemented in a construction context. Employing a single case study approach, the article uses ecological systems theory and concept mapping to examine the results of focus groups with twelve young people who transitioned to employment in the Australian construction industry through a unique project-based intermediary set up by a major contractor to meet its social procurement requirements. Addressing the current under-theorisation of social procurement research, this article offers new conceptual insights into the socio-ecological networks that influence young people's successful transition to employment in construction. The findings also provide new practical insights for government policymakers and the construction industry into the potential role that project-based intermediation can play in addressing youth unemployment in the context of emerging social procurement policies in many countries.

AB  - Background: Developing strategies to change health behaviour is one of the biggest challenges of health promotion programs. Social media, as a popular and innovative communication and education tool, offers opportunities to modify health behaviour. While literature on using social media for health promotion campaigns is growing, there is a need to evaluate the approaches used to change health behaviour, rather than only creating awareness. Objective: The paper reviewed the literature on application of social media in health promotion campaigns with a particular focus on the methodologies used in assessing the outcome of the programs for behaviour change. This fills the void in collating evidence to extend health promotion campaigns to effect sustainable behavioural change. Method: Peer-reviewed articles were identified through multiple science databases. A systematic electronic search was conducted to retrieve review and original papers published between January 2010 and April 2022. The titles and abstracts of the articles were screened according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. All authors independently read the full texts and discussed them to reach a consensus about the themes. Concept mapping was used to present results from analysis of the included papers. Results: Of the 674 citations, 28 (4.1%) studies were included in this review. The methodology approaches of 18 (2.7%) papers, that aimed to evaluate the impact of social media in health promotion campaigns towards behaviour change, were analysed further using concept mapping. The results showed that 10 studies (55.5%) adopted quantitative methods and five studies (27.7%) used mixed methods and three studies (16.6%) used qualitative methods. Facebook and YouTube were used more for intervention purposes to change health behaviour. Twitter and Instagram were used more to observe the trend of changes in health behaviour. Six studies (33.3%) adopted Social Cognitive Theory and one study (5.5%) applied the Transtheoretical Model as the framework to evaluate the outcome. Overall, the results show that though social media has potential in promoting behaviour change, the estimation of this change in long-term lies outside the scope of social media health campaigns. This is also reflected in the methodologies used in existing studies to assess such sustainable changes. The employed measures usually target immediate behaviour or social media engagement rather than addressing the change on a behavioural level. Conclusion: Evaluating the performance of social media campaigns to promote health behaviours towards a sustainable outcome is a complex process. Emerging research is focused on evaluating the potential of social media as an opportunity to create awareness. Such measures require less effort in quantifying and isolating the effect. The design of the campaigns is required to be aligned in relation to stages of the behaviour change. The study provides suggestions on how this can be achieved.

AB  - The derivative is not only an important subject for mathematics but also is an important subject for engineering, physics, economy, chemistry, and statistics. Especially, mathematics depends on strongly preceding learning and the subject of derivative will be used in university education by all students. Therefore, it is one of the most important subjects. This study's purpose is to explore student mistakes and errors in derivative and determine the areas in which students have probable misconceptions. For this purpose, 7 questions were chosen from "the Student Placement Test" (OSS). These questions were transferred into open-ended questions. The results of the study cook place at sixth form college are described and discussed. The test administered to 53 students from Balikesir Fatma Emin Kutvar Anatolian High School in the fall-term of 2005-2006. Determining the possible misconceptions should help teachers when they teach this subject. The study findings showed that students could not understand derivative definition that depends on limit, make mistakes in composite functions and trigonometric functions, and establish wrong relations between tangent's slope, and normal's slope. Teachers need to be able to find errors and misconceptions in students' solutions. Teachers also need to be applying meaningful learning strategies such as concept maps, worksheets about derivative (e.g. Appendix B, Appendix C).

AB  - This research is conducted to identify the scientific conceptual cognition of ecosystem and the corresponding alternative conceptions by lower-secondary school students in Taiwan. Concept mapping, interviewing, and two-tier diagnostic test cannot make explicit reasoning pathways that students may use. Therefore, its purpose is to develop, validate, and utilize a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument for the ecosystem concept (TDIEC). The instrument can assist teachers in analyzing their students' reasoning. This does not only distinguish alternative conceptions from lack of knowledge but also determines the percentages of false positives and false negatives. One hundred and six students were tested with this instrument in Taiwan. The data analysis reveals common alternative conceptions shared by students, indicating that 35.59% of the samples had inaccurate conceptualizations of ecosystems. Common alternative conceptions of ecosystems include the following: (i) Only biological components constitute an ecosystem; (ii) The Venus flytrap and pitcher plants are preys; (iii) Competition is synonymous to predation; (iv) Ecological balance refers to the sustainable circulation of energy and matter in the environment; and (v) The simpler the species, the more stable the ecosystem. It concludes with the interpretation of the results, suggestions for the application of the TDIEC, and correct alternative conceptions in Ecology classes.

AB  - The crimes of aggression with chemical substances have become widespread worldwide. Although their number is not representative, they have taken a certain boom as a form of revenge. Resulting in a preference for the perpetrators in the case of femicides. In Ecuador, at the legislative level, the intention is exposed to guarantee the life of human beings, to live in a healthy environment, free of violence and good living, but there is uncertainty related to the mechanisms for the prosecution of these crimes of harm to health. The Comprehensive Organic Criminal Code does not expressly classify this crime that is committed not to try to take life but to mark the person for life. In this document there is no adequate classification for the prosecution to guarantee that the penalty imposed is consistent with the crime committed. For this, it is necessary to achieve understanding and understanding of the situation by the interested persons, which is exposed as the objective of the work. To achieve this, concept maps were developed as a tool, and thus contribute to decision-making to improve the legal processing of crime.

T2  - AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHYSICS

KW  - CATEGORIZATION
AB  - In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles of non-relativistic theory. The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of undergraduate textbooks, and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties. The answer consists of seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed to account for the results of measurement and time evolution. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets of the interplay between the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables, and to highlight the educational significance of the relations between observables. The maps can be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure and by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While this framework may be adapted to different approaches and interpretive stances, it provides indications in favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one.

AB  - The AstraZeneca-Exeter Science through Telematics (AZEST) project provided evidence that the Internet has much potential as a communication channel for the provision and discussion of INSET materials for primary science in the UK. Participating teachers were able to access and use the project website effectively, were more likely to provide feedback when they had personal access to the Internet either at home or at school, and provided valuable feedback concerning the AZEST tasks, but they tended not to respond directly to messages from other participants. Discussion, via e-mail or a web-based discussion forum, was enhanced if participants knew each other personally. There was evidence that the AZEST science INSET materials enhanced teachers' understanding of science concepts and raised their confidence, increased teachers' effectiveness in the role of Science Subject Leader, and improved teachers' pedagogic practice through encouraging innovative investigative approaches to the teaching and learning of science. Participating teachers indicated that a website dedicated to primary science at the local level was valued. Concept mapping was found to be a valuable tool for stimulating discussion and for assessing pupils' and teachers' understanding and was mostly enjoyed by pupils and staff.

TI  - The educational potential of multimedia authoring as a part of the earth science curriculum - A case study
T2  - JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN SCIENCE TEACHING
AB  - The purpose of this study was to assess the potential of multimedia authoring, as a learning tool, using the software ASTOUND. The subjects in this study were 32 students in two Grade 12 classes. The context of the study was a multi-disciplinary environmental unit about earthquakes. Students were provided with basic background about earthquakes via laboratory experiments and field trips. At a later stage, the students did in-depth independent projects on selected topics related to earthquakes. Once completed, the students presented their projects using the multimedia software ASTOUND. The research consisted of the following stages: a pre-development phase; curriculum design phase; implementation and evaluation. The research tools included: questionnaires, interviews, observations, concept mapping, and an analysis of the multimedia presentations. The findings showed that an integration of laboratory exercises, field trips, and an independent study project, could lead to meaningful learning. However, although most of the students enjoyed using the multimedia program, there was no evidence to support the assumption that it contributed to knowledge acquisition. In fact, much of the time invested in multimedia authoring was devoted to producing decorative effects, reducing the time available for meaningful learning. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Learning to program requires diligent practice and creates room for discovery, trial and error, debugging, and concept mapping. Learners must walk this long road themselves, supported by appropriate and timely feedback. Providing such feedback in programming exercises is not a humanly feasible task. Therefore, the early and steadily growing interest of computer science educators in the automated assessment of programming exercises is not surprising. The automated assessment of programming assignments has been an active area of research for over a century, and interest in it continues to grow as it adapts to new developments in computer science and the resulting changes in educational requirements. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the work that has been performed, who has performed it, its evolution over time, the relationships between publications, its hot topics, and open problems, among others. This paper presents a bibliometric study of the field, with a particular focus on the issue of automatic feedback generation, using literature data from the Web of Science Core Collection. It includes a descriptive analysis using various bibliometric measures and data visualizations on authors, affiliations, citations, and topics. In addition, we performed a complementary analysis focusing only on the subset of publications on the specific topic of automatic feedback generation. The results are highlighted and discussed.

AB  - The term metaconceptual refers to metacognitive knowledge and processes that are acting on and related to one's conceptual system. In this study, metaconceptual teaching activities were implemented to facilitate pre-service teachers' engagement in metaconceptual processes. It was the purpose of this research to investigate the changes in pre-service teachers' alternative ideas regarding flowering plants after being exposed to metaconceptual teaching activities. The participants consisted of 32 pre-service teachers who were enrolled in a college level second-year laboratory class about flowering plants. A 13 item open-ended question set was administered a week before and a week after the instructional interventions. In order to facilitate students' engagement in metaconceptual processes, they were exposed to several instructional activities including poster drawing, journal writing, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. Alternative conceptions that pre-service teachers had prior to and following the instructional interventions were identified and the ones that changed, did not change and developed after the instruction were examined. The results of this study show that metaconceptual teaching activities were effective at changing pre-service teachers' alternative conceptions regarding flowering plants.

AB  - Appropriate selection of learning content is related to the teacher's orientation in the knowledge of the lesson, it is also an important part of the pedagogical content knowledge that a teacher should possess professional. This study aims to promote pre-service elementary teachers' orientation changes on scientific-content selection. This script is written based on investigating using qualitative method to eight pre-service elementary teacher. The analysis is based on the pre-service teachers' concept map each five science lesson and five times interviews in pre-service teacher's collaborative reflection. We found pre-service elementary teacher's orientation changes on scientific-content selection which are harmonic, scrambled and constant. It is caused by interaction between pre-service teachers in a real teaching and collaborative reflection. It can be concluded that in getting experiences and having reflection interaction, pre-service teachers indicate changes in professional teachers' orientation, namely didactic and discovery. Thus promoting pre-service elementary teachers' orientation, especially scientific content selection change can be conducted by applying real teaching, interaction among teachers and pre-service teachers, interaction among pre-service teachers, and collaborative reflection.

AB  - A research team consisting of educators of gifted students, a scientist, and experts in measurement developed a performance-based assessment of life science skills and abilities. Four high schools in the Southwestern United States were the settings for field testing and implementation. Five levels of ratings were given: unknown, maybe, probably, definitely, and wow. The majority of student scores were in the maybe and probably categories. Using six new measures (concept maps in life and physical science, math problem solving, spatial analytical performance assessment, life science performance assessment and physical science performance assessment), 23 students (M2) were selected for participation in science laboratories at an R1 university along with 20 students (M1) selected by conventional means. When the nine attribute scores of the performance-based assessment were compared, no significant difference was found t(41), p > .38, between M1 and M2 students. Performance-based assessments in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will provide an alternative and a complement to standard achievement tests. They have the potential to identify and nurture exceptionally talented high school students across all demographic groups.

AB  - The skill set required of biomedical researchers continues to grow and evolve as biology matures as a natural science. Science necessitates creative yet critical thinking, persuasive communication skills, purposeful use of time, and adeptness at the laboratory bench. Teaching these skills can be effectively accomplished in an inquiry-based, active-learning environment at a primarily undergraduate institution. Cell Biology Techniques, an upper-level cell biology laboratory course at St. John Fisher College, features two independent projects that take advantage of the biology of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, a premier yet simple model organism. First, students perform a miniature epigenetic screen for novel phenotypes using RNA interference. The results of this screen combined with literature research direct students toward a singe gene that they attempt to subclone in the second project. The biology of the chosen gene/protein also becomes an individualized focal point with respect to the content of the laboratory. Progress toward course goals is evaluated using written, oral, and group-produced assignments, including a concept map. Pre- and postassessment indicates a significant increase in the understanding of broad concepts in cell biological research.

AB  - Formative assessment is a new method of educational assessment. In contrast to summative assessment, formative assessment constitutes a relatively modern assessment method, whose goal is to reveal the student's weaknesses to the teacher and help the teacher to design accordingly appropriate practices to aid the students improve their performance. Formative assessment application can be done periodically and can be categorized to short-term, when executed between classes, and to long-term. Several innovative assessment techniques for assessment in engineering education have been proposed during the recent years, such as the use of concept maps, assessing student's Learning Outcomes, five step outcome driven assessment and more, both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. A smart system especially designed and implemented for the particular needs of engineering education and STEM education in general, is presented on this paper. Such a system is currently under development and tested for the purposes of mathematical education in primary and secondary education. If the right adjustments and modifications are made, it can work for STEM education as well.

AB  - This paper presents the results of educational research in the field of documentary heritage taught at the School of Information Sciences at the Autonomous University of San Luis Potosi. For research, three elements are followed. The first element results of the use of teaching tools such as concept maps, case studies and problems, among others that were investigated. The second consists of a questionnaire on learning of the subject he is used to determine the topics of interest or those that were complicated for students and required reinforcement or further explanations. The third one consists on the development of a rubric establishing a parameter of possible final learning outcomes of the group. Regarding the application, the most important was timely identification of students' barriers for learning and performing actions to take ownership of knowledge. The strongest parts of the class directly related to the areas corresponding to Sciences of the Documentary Information and history. The weakest part is pricing or allocation of the economic value of library and documentary goods, due to the fact that this task is consolidated with extensive market knowledge and experience.

TI  - Using moodle and other software tools in EFL courses in a Japanese IT university
T2  - 2007 CIT: 7TH IEEE INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON COMPUTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, PROCEEDINGS
CP  - 7th IEEE International Conference on Computer and Information Technology
AB  - Throughout their public school education, Japanese students are socialized into cultural learning practices [1] that emphasize group-oriented tasks. Well-organized group work is paramount to successful EFL teaching in Japan. In this paper, we look at how Moodle an open-source learning management system, is used at a Japanese computer science university to organize both individual and group tasks. Examples are provided of freeware and open-source software tools, such as CmapTools for concept mapping and Praat for acoustic analysis that can be used within Moodle to enhance EFL reading, writing, and pronunciation courses. We also explore how Moodle can be integrated with collaborative document production tools, such as Google Docs and Spreadsheets. Finally, we demonstrate the use of Moodle as a tool for action research, enabling the teacher/researcher to tightly control the course content in two different courses while systematically varying aspects of the content to test hypotheses about language learning. An important aspect of our work is the systematization of group process in language and communication courses and the development of a context for experimentation.

AB  - The Ocean Observing Initiative (OOI) was designed to advance understanding of complex oceanographic processes by acquiring large quantities of data at six key locations in the world ocean. The OOI Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization has built an educational cyberinfrastructure and developed interactive tools targeted for undergraduate-level learners that enable easy access to OOI data, images, and video. To develop the suite of OOI education tools, EPE used an iterative design process, including needs assessment, tool prototyping, and usability testing in undergraduate classrooms. Data visualization and concept mapping tools were envisioned as a way to help undergraduates link concepts students see in oceanography textbooks to real-world phenomena. A Data Investigation Builder (DIB) was constructed to assist professors in designing data activities. During the usability testing, professors provided valuable feedback that allowed EPE to improve the tools. Based on the lessons learned from EPE, in 2016 we developed a new prototype set of Data Explorations that were more modular and easier to integrate into an undergraduate lecture or problem set. This paper reviews how the EPE toolset was developed, including establishment of requirements for the tools and incorporation of lessons learned from the user needs assessment and the results of usability testing of prototype tools.

AB  - Based on William Morris Davis' great Transcontinental Excursion of 1912, this article assesses and reviews the Geography by Rail (R) program (GbR) - a unique, short-term, field-based study abroad experience that takes an uncommon-in-the-US approach to international exploration and fieldwork, incorporating on-the-ground, regional geography-based learning experiences. Though it could be used as such, this is not intended as a how-to article, but instead, an examination of how the program's alternative approach to short-term, field-based learning increases student engagement, enlivens the discipline of geography by championing the regional geography approach, and bridges the physical-human divide in geography. Examples are given of assessment techniques, relevant skills gained by student participants, student feedback received, and potential limitations of such a program. Our main goal rests in demonstrating that by being in the landscape, practicing in it, students often gain a perspective not achievable in the traditional classroom setting. In the regional and romantic geography sense, favoring breadth of learning over depth, we further argue that GbR represents a novel way to accomplish this important-yet-not-often-fostered and, oddly and unfortunately, difficult-to-find-in-geography concept.

AB  - Underpinned by a holistic, dynamic, and process-oriented view of teacher competences, this study provides an analytic hierarchy system of instructional design competence (IDC) for evaluating teachers' IDC based on the mental model of instructional design. Additionally, this study quantitatively explores the IDC characteristics and correlations of 118 preservice science teachers at Shanxi Normal University in China, who learned the ADTRE (analyzing, designing, teaching, revising, and evaluating/improving) instructional model, based on reflection and feedback. Using lesson planning (LP) scoring rubrics, we analyzed 113 lesson plans from 56 participants majoring in biological science and 57 in biological technology. We present the ADTRE model and discuss relationships between preservice science teachers' academic achievement and IDC. Major findings include a positive correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC scores and their course grades in Advanced Mathematics and Cell Biology and concept mapping skills. There was a negative correlation between preservice science teachers' IDC and course grades in Principles of Genetic Engineering and Technology, and no significant correlations existed between IDC and course grades for teacher education courses. Our findings reveal the nature of preservice science teachers' IDC, a potential for improvement in university teacher education curricula, and a need for further research.

AB  - This study aims to investigate undergraduate students' cognitive structures and determinate misconceptions about chemical bonding phenomena. On the other hand, the study achieves to recommend an alternative technique for the evaluation of Word Associations Tests (WAT). The study was carried out with the participation of first year studens; 141 from engineering faculty and 73 from medical sciences faculty of a foundation university in the spring semester of 2017-2018 academic year. WAT about chemical bonds prepared by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. Content analysis were used to analyze the data. The students' responds to the key words given to them were divided into themes and cut-off technique was used according to the themes distinguished. In this context, students' cognitive structures related to chemical bonds were determined within the framework of themes. It has been determined that the students' WAT results regarding to chemical bonding, which supported with concept maps within the framework of the themes, provides convenience in determining the misconceptions because of reflects the concepts and the relationships between the concepts more clearly. In consequence, it is suggested that the new technique of evaluation recommended could be used in prospective studies.

AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students' vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students' vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes.

AB  - In computer science, students could benefit from exposure to critical programming concepts from multiple perspectives. Peer review is one method to allow students to experience authentic uses of the concepts in an activity that is not itself programming. In this work, we examine how to implement the peer review process in early, object-oriented computer science courses as a way to increase the students' knowledge of programming concepts, specifically Abstraction, Decomposition, and Encapsulation, and to develop their higher-level thinking skills. We are exploring the peer review process, the effects of the type of review on the reviewers, and the results this has on the students' learning.
   To study these ideas, we used peer review activities in CS2 classes at two universities over the course of a semester. Using three groups (one reviewing their peers, one reviewing the instructor, and one completing small design or coding assignments), we measured the students' conceptual understanding throughout the semester with concept maps and the reviews they completed. We found that reviewing helped students learn Decomposition, especially those reviewing the instructor's programs, but we did not find that it improved the students' level of thinking. Overall, reviews (peer or otherwise) are beneficial for teaching Decomposition to CS2 students and can be used as an alternative method for teaching other object-oriented programming concepts.

AB  - As an instructional tool, models can transform the student experience from the static to the dynamic, the flat to the 3D, and the siloed to the integrated. Few practical resources exist to help instructors transition toward model-based classroom practices. The Modeling in the Classroom evidence-based teaching guide provides instructors with a tool kit for incorporating models and modeling into their classrooms (https://lse.ascb.org/evidence-based-teaching-guides/modeling-in-the-classroom). The guide discusses the underpinnings of modeling as a core scientific practice, one that can enable student development of systems thinking skills and understanding of biological concepts. The guide describes a variety of model types, including phylogenetic trees, simulations, animations, diagrams, conceptual models, concept maps, and tactile models supported by summaries of and links to articles and resources. In this paper, we will introduce key findings describing why and how to use models in the classroom. We also describe open research questions needed to address classroom implementation, instructional design, and development of students' knowledge and skills. It is our hope that the guide will provide a suitable combination of research-based findings and practical suggestions that instructors will be supported and encouraged to thoughtfully incorporate modeling to support learning goals.

AB  - Students always encounter difficulties in studying biochemical pathways. They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one-by-one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The "AG City" is a self-learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy-to-understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as "railway stations". Students can easily identify common "railway stations" presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together. This interactive self-learning tool has been packaged as a courseware using the Articulate Storyline eLearning authoring software.

KW  - SCIENCE
AB  - Background: The importance of music and play in early childhood development is widely acknowledged. However, no recent studies have investigated the potential of music-inspired free play to foster scientific exploration.
   Aim: The purpose of this qualitative case study is to explain the rationale in utilising musical skills, knowledge and experiences during free play to foster scientific exploration, applying a constructivist approach with the learner placed at the centre of the educational process, while the teacher acts as observer and facilitator.
   Setting: Data were primarily collected through documents to create a concept map that informed observations of preschoolers during free play at two day-care centres in Mohadin in the North-West Province of South Africa.
   Methods: An explanatory case study provided the context for this study and a document analysis informed the findings.
   Results: Through data analysis, key themes were identified from the literature and observations to generate a conceptual model that illustrates the influence of music-inspired free play to foster scientific exploration by stimulating creativity and emphasising the necessity of free play in preschool settings.
   Conclusion: The conclusion of this investigation was a better understanding of the capacity of young learners to apply scientific exploration, utilising a transdisciplinary approach for teaching and learning the sciences in the early years to develop a better understanding of their world through music-inspired free play.

AB  - Purpose - This article aims to describe the standards-based approach used to build the International Studies Research Methods (INS250) course, a discipline-specific, credit-based class taught by librarians. This writing-intensive course emphasizes information literacy and critical thinking skills, which were developed using written assignments, class presentations, multiple assessment methods, and web-based applications.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper will review the literature about discipline-specific, credit-based information literacy (IL) courses and outcomes. It will also analyze the INS250 course structure and map ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education to learning outcomes for the course.
   Findings - The paper finds that, in the absence of discipline-specific information literacy standards, the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education can serve as a starting point for International Studies course outcomes and assessment. Other assessment approaches, specifically student workshops and concept maps, promote student engagement and provide ample evidence of student learning.
   Originality/value - This article will identify research skills needed by International Studies majors and students in similar multidisciplinary programs. It will serve as a model of how to build a credit-based course with application to other fields such as political science, sustainability, human rights and international business. The course is student-focused and responsive to new disciplines and areas, with an emphasis on disciplinary databases, search skills, and citation skills.

AB  - This case study draws attention to Pedro's story, a Grade 6 Latino teacher who, along with other grade 4-6 teachers, participated in a three-year professional development research project. By using data analyzed from multiple ethnographic interviews with teachers and students, and by drawing from the quantitative analyzes of concept map unit tests, we illustrate how Pedro's significant professional growth and his students' learning were truncated by top-down school district policies. These policies were implemented because of the punitive nature of the No Child Left Behind Act. Simply put, this case study exposes the impact of opp(reg) ressive policies on learning, that is, policies simultaneously oppressive and regressive. The critical perspective of the project, and its emphasis on assisting teachers to make their pedagogy and curriculum more culturally and socially relevant, was informed by sociotransformative constructivism (sTc). This is a theoretical framework that affords equal importance to cross-cultural education (learning about and acting on socially/culturally relevant issues) and social constructivism (learning to critically produce and consume knowledge). We hope that this case study will provide additional insights into the slow progress we continue to make in science teacher professional development and in closing the achievement gap.

AB  - Using multiple representations and argumentation are two fundamental processes in science. With the advancements of information communication technologies, these two processes are blended more so than ever before. However, little is known about how these two processes interact with each other in student learning. Hence, we conducted a design-based study in order to distill the relationship between these two processes. Specifically, we designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of preservice middle school teachers. The participants used a web-based knowledge organization platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, concept map, and pictorial. The participants organized their knowledge on nuclear energy by searching, sorting, clustering information through the use of these representational modes and argued about the nuclear energy issue. We found that the use of multiple representations and argumentation interacted with each other in a complex way. Based on our findings, we argue that the complexity can be unfolded in two aspects: (a) the use of multiple representations mediates argumentation in different forms and for different purposes; (b) the type of argumentation that leads to refinement of the use of multiple representations is often non-mediated and drawn from personal experience.

AB  - The solution of complex, unstructured problems is faced with policy controversy and dispute, unused and misused knowledge, IF project delay and failure, and decline of public trust in governmental decisions. Mental model mapping (also called concept mapping) is a technique to analyse these difficulties on a fundamental cognitive level, which can reveal experiences, perceptions, assumptions, knowledge and subjective beliefs of stakeholders, experts and other actors, and can stimulate communication and learning. This article presents the theoretical framework from which the use of mental model mapping techniques to analyse this type of problems emerges as a promising technique.
   The framework consists of the problem solving or policy design cycle, the knowledge production or modelling cycle, and the (computer) model as interface between the cycles. Literature attributes difficulties in the decision-making process to communication gaps between decision makers, stakeholders and scientists, and to the construction of knowledge within different paradigm groups 6 that leads to different interpretation of the problem situation. Analysis of the decision-making process literature indicates that choices, which are made in all steps of the problem solving cycle, are based on an individual decision maker's frame of perception. 6 This frame, in turn, depends on the mental model residing in the mind of the individual. Thus we identify three levels of awareness on which the decision process can be analysed. This research focuses on the third level. Mental models can be elicited using mapping techniques. In this way, analysing an individual's mental model can shed light on decision-making problems. The steps of the knowledge production cycle are, in the same manner, ultimately driven by the mental models of the scientist in a specific discipline. Remnants of this mental model can be found in the resulting computer model.
   The characteristics of unstructured problems (complexity, uncertainty and disagreement) can be positioned in the framework, as can the communities of knowledge construction and valuation involved in the solution of these problems (core science, applied science, and professional consultancy, and "post-normal" science).
   Mental model maps, this research hypothesises, are suitable to analyse the above aspects of the problem. This hypothesis is tested for the case of the Zwolle storm surch barrier. Analysis can aid integration between disciplines, participation of public stakeholders, and can stimulate learning processes. Mental model mapping is recommended to visualise the use of knowledge, to analyse difficulties in problem solving process, and to aid information transfer and communication. Mental model mapping help scientists to shape their new, post-normal responsibilities in a manner that complies with integrity when dealing with unstructured problems in complex, multifunctional systems.

AB  - The paper presents the follow-up of a case study investigation with students of ESP (English for Specific Purposes) on a tertiary level (1st and 4th year students), consisting of collaborative learner-teacher activities, including concept mapping and content-based learning. The results of our project in progress are considered for an optimal adaptation of an ESP textbook which is intended for students in several areas related to the Life Sciences (Agriculture, Biotechnologies, Biology, Genetic Engineering, Horticulture, etc.). The framework of the course support we propose, as well as our methodology and tool kit are provided by ecolinguistics and the aim is achieving ecological learning and meaningful communication in the language class and beyond. The object of this exploratory study is to highlight the potential of collaborative learning environments, to enable students to employ conceptual mapping and find relations between significant concepts in the Life Sciences. The feedback was collected from ESP learners as materials were collaboratively selected and designed together with students, based on the construction of conceptual maps. The question raised in our preliminary study draws on a review of the literature pertinent to meaningful conceptual learning. Some of the key concepts addressed in the ecologically-designed English courses are analysed, focusing on feedback from the students and constantly adapting our findings to better serve their needs.

AB  - Background: The Data and Connectivity COVID-19 Vaccines Pharmacovigilance (DaC-VaP) UK-wide collaboration was created to monitor vaccine uptake and effectiveness and provide pharmacovigilance using routine clinical and administrative data. To monitor these, pooled analyses may be needed. However, variation in terminologies present a barrier as England uses the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT), while the rest of the United Kingdom uses the Read v2 terminology in primary care. The availability of data sources is not uniform across the United Kingdom.
   Objective: This study aims to use the concept mappings in the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) common data model (CDM) to identify common concepts recorded and to report these in a repeated cross-sectional study. We planned to do this for vaccine coverage and 2 adverse events of interest (AEIs), cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) and anaphylaxis. We identified concept mappings to SNOMED CT, Read v2, the World Health Organization's International Classification of Disease Tenth Revision (ICD-10) terminology, and the UK Dictionary of Medicines and Devices (dm+d).
   Methods: Exposures and outcomes of interest to DaC-VaP for pharmacovigilance studies were selected. Mappings of these variables to different terminologies used across the United Kingdom's devolved nations' health services were identified from the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) Automated Terminology Harmonization, Extraction, and Normalization for Analytics (ATHENA) online browser. Lead analysts from each nation then confirmed or added to the mappings identified. These mappings were then used to report AEIs in a common format. We reported rates for windows of 0-2 and 3-28 days postvaccine every 28 days.
   Results: We listed the mappings between Read v2, SNOMED CT, ICD-10, and dm+d. For vaccine exposure, we found clear mapping from OMOP to our clinical terminologies, though dm+d had codes not listed by OMOP at the time of searching. We found a list of CVST and anaphylaxis codes. For CVST, we had to use a broader cerebral venous thrombosis conceptual approach to include Read v2. We identified 56 SNOMED CT codes, of which we selected 47 (84%), and 15 Read v2 codes. For anaphylaxis, our refined search identified 60 SNOMED CT codes and 9 Read v2 codes, of which we selected 10 (17%) and 4 (44%), respectively, to include in our repeated cross-sectional studies.
   Conclusions: This approach enables the use of mappings to different terminologies within the OMOP CDM without the need to catalogue an entire database. However, Read v2 has less granular concepts than some terminologies, such as SNOMED CT. Additionally, the OMOP CDM cannot compensate for limitations in the clinical coding system. Neither Read v2 nor ICD-10 is sufficiently granular to enable CVST to be specifically flagged. Hence, any pooled analysis will have to be at the less specific level of cerebrovascular venous thrombosis. Overall, the mappings within this CDM are useful, and our method could be used for rapid collaborations where there are only a limited number of concepts to pool.

AB  - The study focuses on the investigation of the effects of metaconceptual laboratory activities related to photosynthesis and respiration in plants on the conceptual understanding of pre-service science teachers. To this end, the current study was conducted with the participation of 34 pre-service science teachers who were taught the subjects of photosynthesis and respiration in plants through metaconceptual laboratory activities within the context of the General Biology Laboratory Applications Course, in the spring term of 2016-2017 academic year. The study employed the single-group pretest-posttest model. The data of the current study were collected by using the "Photosynthesis and Respiration in Plants Concept Test" and "open-ended questions". The collected data were analyzed through the descriptive analysis technique. As a result of the study, it was found that the use of metaconceptual laboratory activities in biology laboratory applications enhanced the conceptual understanding of the subject of interest and resulted in the elimination of some misconceptions. In this regard, it can be suggested that during biology laboratory activities focusing on teaching of abstract and challenging concepts, students should be rendered more active by means of activities such as constructing the concept map of their metacognition, preparing posters, conducting class and group discussions about experiments and writing journals.

AB  - Ausubel and Novak's construct of meaningful learning stipulates that substantive connections between new knowledge and what is already known requires the integration of thinking, feeling, and performance (Novak J. D., (2010), Learning, creating, and using knowledge: concept maps as facilitative tools in schools and corporations, New York, NY: Routledge Taylor & Francis Group.). This study explores the integration of these three domains using a structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. A tripartite model was developed to examine meaningful learning through the correlational relationships among thinking, feeling, and performance using student responses regarding Intellectual Accessibility and Emotional Satisfaction on the Attitudes toward the Subject of Chemistry Inventory version 2 (ASCI V2) and performance on the American Chemical Society exam. We compared the primary model to seven alternatives in which correlations were systematically removed in order to represent a lack of interconnectedness among the three domains. The tripartite model had the strongest statistical fit, thereby providing statistical evidence for the construct of meaningful learning. Methodological issues associated with SEM techniques, including problems related to non-normal multivariate distributions (an assumption of traditional SEM techniques), and causal relationships are considered. Additional findings include evidence for weak configural invariance in the pre/post implementation of the ASCI(V2), mainly due to the poor structure of the pretest data. The results are discussed in terms of their implications for teaching and learning.

AB  - Computers are promising tools for providing educational experiences that meet individual learning needs. However, delivering this promise in practice is challenging, particularly when automated feedback is essential and the learning extends beyond using traditional methods such as writing and solving mathematics problems. We hypothesize that interactive knowledge representations can be deployed to address this challenge. Knowledge representations differ markedly from concept maps. Where the latter uses nodes (concepts) and arcs (links between concepts), a knowledge representation is based on an ontology that facilitates automated reasoning. By adjusting this reasoning towards interacting with learners for the benefit of learning, a new class of educational instruments emerges. In this contribution, we present three projects that use an interactive knowledge representation as their foundation. DynaLearn supports learners in acquiring system thinking skills. Minds-On helps learners to deepen their understanding of phenomena while performing experiments. Interactive Concept Cartoons engage learners in a science-based discussion about controversial topics. Each of these approaches has been developed iteratively in collaboration with teachers and tested in real classrooms, resulting in a suite of lessons available online. Evaluation studies involving pre-/post-tests and action-log data show that learners are easily capable of working with these educational instruments and that the instruments thus enable a semi-automated approach to constructive learning.

AB  - Within the framework of the Bologna Process, the UNESCO Chair in Environmental Education and Sustainable Development, based at the National University of Distance Education of Spain, is developing research in the field of educational innovation with the aim of incorporating in its learning model the methodological procedures resulting from recent developments in information technology. The teaching innovation projects presented in this work have been designed for students of Environmental Education and Sustainable Development as part of their Environmental Sciences and Education Courses, who were used to test the learning potential of two teaching methodologies: a) the Cmap Tools editor for the construction of concept maps, which is particularly designed to enhance understanding of the relations that make up the conceptual structure of the topics of study; and b) online collaborative learning groups, intended to promote team work and encourage participation, dialogue and divergent thought all of which are central to education for sustainability. Each pilot project generated material and resources specifically designed for this purpose and entailed a consistent assessment process.

AB  - Industry 4.0 relevant systems (eg, cyber-physical systems, digital twins, and alike) need digitized knowledge to function. Before digitizing knowledge, a fundamental question arises: What is knowledge? In order to answer this question, this study first reviews the definitions of knowledge found in the extant literature of epistemology, engineering design, manufacturing, organization science, information science, and education science. Since the definitions reported so far are not succinct and suffer circularity, this study overcomes this by introducing a three-element-based definition of knowledge-a piece knowledge consists of three elements defined as claim, provenance, and inference. This results in four types of knowledge defined as definitional, deductive, inductive, and creative knowledge, and each type of knowledge is again divided into some categories. Some real-life scenarios relevant to engineering design and manufacturing are used to clarify the proposed knowledge types/categories; the relevant pieces of knowledge are represented by knowledge graphs (concept maps) for the sake of digitization. The myriad proximal and distal relationships between knowledge and other relevant entities (human/machine learning, logical inferences, experimental data, analytical results, creative thinking, and cognitive reflections) become succinct and transparent due to the proposed definition of knowledge. Consequently, this study establishes the fundamentals of developing sophisticated methods and tools for the advancement of Industry 4.0.

AB  - This study focuses on how teachers learn to teach a new topic and the role played by their developing content knowledge as they teach. The paper is based on seven high school science teachers' studies on the teaching of semiconductors, at the time a new topic in the curriculum. Analysis of artefacts such as teacher concept maps, video recordings of lessons, journals and other classroom-based evidence shows how the extent and type of teachers' content knowledge informed their choice of teaching approaches and how their learning of content took place alongside the development of teaching strategies. The development of content knowledge was combined with increased understanding of how to teach the topic in almost all cases. Evidence of development of teachers' PCK was found in their increased ability to design teaching strategies, and their use of representations and suitable assessment tasks for their lessons. Some specific common teaching strategies were identified across the teachers. These strategies could add to the canon of teachers' topic - specific professional knowledge for semiconductors. The study provides increased understanding of how teachers simultaneously master content and its teaching and how mediated self-reflection is a fruitful approach for assisting teachers to learn to teach a new topic.

AB  - Using conceptual change as a theoretical lens, the purpose of this study is to describe the structure of a learner's conceptual ecology within a specific content area (biological evolution) and to illustrate how this ecology influences the process of conceptual change. Data were gathered using participant observations in a high school Biology II classroom as well as a series of 17 open-ended and structured interviews with each of four research participants. The interviews were designed to illustrate the participants' approaches to biology as well as to describe their changing conceptual frameworks for evolutionary theory. Interview techniques used include: concept mapping, drawing interviews, discussion of pre- and posttests, and sorting tasks. A learner's conceptual ecology for evolution was found to include prior conceptions related to evolutionary theory (both scientific and alternative), scientific and religious orientations, view of the biological world, and acceptance of evolutionary theory. However, the data demonstrate that the actions of these aspects of the conceptual ecology can vary among individuals and no single controlling mechanism was isolated. Most importantly, the data demonstrate that conceptual change has significant affective components as evidence is evaluated by learners and this evaluation is often based on extralogical criteria.

AB  - Background: Dental educators complain that students struggle to apply what they have learnt theoretically in the clinical context. This paper is premised on the assumption that there is a relationship between conceptual thinking and clinical reasoning.
   Aims: The paper provides a theoretical framework for understanding the relationship between conceptual learning and clinical reasoning.
   Method: A review of current literature is used to explain the way in which conceptual understanding influences clinical reasoning and the transfer of theoretical understandings to the clinical context.
   Results: The paper argues that the connections made between concepts are what is significant about conceptual understanding. From this point of departure the paper describes teaching strategies that facilitate the kinds of learning opportunities that students need in order to develop conceptual understanding and to be able to transfer knowledge from theoretical to clinical contexts. Along with a variety of teaching strategies, the value of concept maps is discussed. The paper provides a framework for understanding the difficulties that students have in developing conceptual networks appropriate for later clinical reasoning.
   Conclusion: In explaining how students learn for clinical application, the paper provides a theoretical framework that can inform how dental educators facilitate the conceptual learning, and later clinical reasoning, of their students.

AB  - Developing students' ability to think about systems, as opposed to isolated facts, is of central importance in much of science teaching. Prior work in this area has focused on students' recognition of the processes occurring within a system. Comparatively, little work has been done on how students organise the objects that are contained within the system. Understanding how objects are organised within a system structure can promote understanding of the processes relating to the objects and advance students' thinking about systems. A systematic literature review revealed different existing theoretical perspectives on object arrangement within systems. These perspectives were combined into a single framework, the Systems Object Framework (SOF), that can be used to characterise student ideas about object arrangements. The SOF was used to analyse object arrangements depicted by students in pre and post-concept maps that were collected as part of a study on a systems-based curriculum. This analysis provided support for the structure of the SOF and showed that the SOF allows for tracking of changes in students' representation of object arrangements. The SOF contributes to the field by proposing new questions to be investigated and providing a common analytical tool that permits greater consistency across future studies.

AB  - Background Modeling studies to inform the design of complex health services interventions often involves elements that differ from the intervention's ultimate real-world use. These "hypothetical" elements include pilot participants, materials, and settings. Understanding the conditions under which studies with "hypothetical" elements can yield valid results would greatly help advance health services research. Our objectives are: 1) to conduct a systematic review of the literature to identify factors affecting the relationship between hypothetical decisions and real-world behaviours, and 2) to summarise and organize these factors into a preliminary framework. Methods We conducted an electronic database search using PsycINFO and Medline on November 30th, 2015, updated March 7th, 2019. We also conducted a supplemental snowball search on December 9th 2015 and a reverse citation search using Scopus and Web of Science. Studies were eligible to be included in this review if they clearly addressed the consistency between some type of hypothetical decision and a corresponding real decision or behaviour. Two reviewers extracted data using a standardized data collection form developed through an iterative consensus-based process. We extracted basic study information and data about each study's research area, design, and research question. Quotations from the articles were extracted and summarized into standardized factor statements. Results Of the 2444 articles that were screened, 68 articles were included in the review. The articles identified 27 factors that we grouped into 4 categories: decision maker factors, cognitive factors, task factors, and matching factors. Conclusions We have summarized a large number of factors that may be relevant when considering whether hypothetical health services pilot work can be expected to yield results that are consistent with real-world behaviours. Our descriptive framework can serve as the basis for organizing future work exploring which factors are most relevant when seeking to develop complex health services interventions.

AB  - Nowadays, the preservice teachers' education is faced with the complex and challenging issue of developing programs that improve both future teachers' ICT competences as well as technological pedagogical content knowledge to incorporate them in their future practice.
   The aim of this study is twofold: describe and analyse the extent of ICT use and self-reported competences by preservice elementary teachers and kindergarten educators in a higher education institution in Lisbon; establish their expectations regarding the future use of collaborative technology for learning purposes.
   The study population is made up of 297 students enrolled at the Basic Education Bachelor degree during the 2016-2017 academic year. In this bachelor, although there are no ICT compulsory courses, students are presented to these tools and are expected to use and develop ICT knowledge and skills in different courses.
   For data collection we have used an on-line survey with closed questions about access, frequency, context, purpose and confidence regarding ICT use and motivation towards future use of collaborative ICT. A total of 131 students, 124 females and 7 males, answered the online survey. After a descriptive analysis, non-parametric tests were used in order to explore the existence of significant relationship between different variables.
   Almost all respondents reported to have internet access in their homes and to have computer as well mobile phone with camera. Of the respondents, 89% informed to use almost daily or even every day the computer at home, while only 22% reported using this device at school with the same frequency. More than 80% of the students stated the almost every day use of ICT tools to do school work and to navigate the internet.
   Of the ICT tools considered in the questionnaire, internet browsing, research, preparation of presentations, text edition and live conversational tools were the technologies which the majority of students reported having used with great confidence. However, more than 50% of the students do not know or do not know how to use data bases, statistic software and tools that allow the construction of concept maps and collaborative pages. Moreover, there is no relation between the reported use of almost ICT tools addressed in the questionnaire and the bachelor year on which students were enrolled.
   Results also indicate that students reported positive expectations regarding using ICT for collaborative work. The introduction of these tools is significantly regarded by the students as an opportunity to learn new things and to improve the final product of their works as well as an interesting experience. Statistical calculations revealed that there is no significant relationship between students' ICT motivations and bachelor year.
   Although the evaluation regarding ICT use is generally positive there are some important educational tools which even students' in the third year of the bachelor don't know. Based on the results obtained, this study suggests a set of recommendations in order to improve students' knowledge and competences regarding ICT. These recommendations include the integration of compulsory science education curricular activities that require the use of data bases, statistic software and tools that allow the construction of concept maps and collaborative pages.

AB  - The aim of this research is to ask what kind of geography is taught in Finnish upper secondary schools and whether this knowledge is powerful knowledge. This is achieved by analysing 11 in-service geography teachers' concept maps and in-depth interviews with qualitative data analysis. The results indicate the dominance of three terms: spatiality, phenomena and a holistic approach running through the teachers' conceptions of geographical knowledge, skills and assessment. Geography is described by the teachers as a science which studies extensive spatial phenomena with the help of concepts and a holistic approach and in which values and student's own lived experiences play a major role. We conclude that the in-service Finnish upper secondary teachers' perceptions of geography are a form of powerful knowledge because they: (1) urge students to form new geographical thinking about the world, (2) give possibilities for students to study geographical phenomena and (3) evaluate their own knowledge, (4) encourage students to follow topical debates in different scales, (5) open up the students' world views and (6) support the general objectives of Finnish upper secondary schools by applying four of the six cross-curricular themes to a great extent in teaching geography, particularly sustainable development.

AB  - This article presents the results of the evaluation of SCIViS - a visualization-based scientific information retrieval (IR) system. SCIViS is based on the logic of concept maps and enables the visualization of relationships among descriptors and authors of scientific papers. It creates an interactive interface between the user's cognitive space and document information space. The system was evaluated by the group of 138 psychology students which have performed a variety of search tasks, using both the classic text-based and the visualization based IR systems. The SCIViS model has proved to be effective and intuitive. Participants were more efficient using the visual IR system, particularly when performing tasks requiring modifications of the initial query and finding alternative keywords. User responses indicated that system's speed and ease of use are the most important attributes of the overall assessment. They also revealed the impact of users' previous experience with IR systems on users' satisfaction and perception of usefulness. Previous experience may be regarded both as the rate of success in performing search tasks, as well as the familiarity with popular search engines. The later one seems to be an important factor in modeling users' information seeking behavior and their attitudes toward alternative IR models. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Purpose The concept of workforce agility has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, defining it has sparked much discussion and ambiguity. Recognizing this ambiguity, this paper aims to inductively develop a behavioral taxonomy of workforce agility. Design/methodology/approach The authors interviewed 36 experts in the field of agility and used concept mapping and the critical incident technique to create a behavioral taxonomy. Findings The authors identified a behavioral taxonomy consisting of ten dimensions: (1) accepting changes, (2) decision making, (3) creating transparency, (4) collaboration, (5) reflection, (6) user centricity, (7) iteration, (8) testing, (9) self-organization, and (10) learning. Research limitations/implications The authors' research contributes to the literature in that it offers an inductively developed behavioral taxonomy of workforce agility with ten dimensions. It further adds to the literature by tying the notion of workforce agility to the performance literature. Practical implications The authors' results suggest that it might be beneficial for companies to take all workforce agility dimensions into account when creating an agile culture, starting agile projects, integrating agility into hiring decisions or evaluating employee performance. Originality/value This paper uses an inductive approach to define workforce agility as a set of behavioral dimensions, integrating the scientific as well as the practitioner literature on agility.

AB  - Inscriptions are central to the practice of science. Previous studies showed, however, that preservice teachers even those with undergraduate degrees in science, generally do not spontaneously produce inscriptions that economically summarize large amounts of data. This study was designed to investigate the production of inscription while a group of 15 graduate-level preservice science teachers engaged in a 15-week course of scientific observation and guided inquiry of two organisms. The course emphasized the production of inscriptions as a way of convincingly supporting claims when the students presented their results. With continuing emphasis on inscriptional representations, we observed a significant increase in the number and type of representations made as the course unfolded. The number of concrete, text-based inscriptions decreased as the number of graphs, tables and other sorts of complex inscriptions increased. As the students moved from purely observational activities to guided inquiry, they made many more transformations of their data into complex and abstract forms, such as graphs and concept maps. The participants' competencies to cross-reference ultimate transformations to initial research questions improved slightly. Our study has implications for the traditional methods by which preservice science teachers are taught in their science classes. (c) 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The typical introductory physics lecture requires students to consolidate and assimilate a large quantity of complex information that is often novel to them. This can leave students overwhelmed, slow the pace of their learning, and lower their motivation. We find that carefully designed multimedia summaries in the form of one-minute videos and short text summaries can significantly increase students' understanding of the material as well as their ability to organize information into a useful mental framework, as measured by their performances on a concept mapping exercise and a conceptual test of learning. Notably, we show that these improvements can be achieved with negligible increase in overall time students spend on the course material each week. We discuss reasons why these short postlecture summaries helped students learn more, namely, that (i) they likely increased students' ability to chunk and organize information while minimizing the extraneous cognitive load imposed by the materials, and (ii) they likely improved students' ability to consolidate and transfer knowledge through the use of contrasting cases. We provide a set of detailed recommendations that instructors can use to develop effective postlecture multimedia summaries. We suggest that one of the most important and impactful recommendations is incorporating student thinking in the design of these types of summaries informed by the input of qualified former students or teaching assistants with significant experience interacting with students in the course.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nowadays, providing access to the required information by clinical informationist (CI) is vital for clinical teams to make the best decision. This study was carried out to identifying how CIs should participate in grand round (GR).
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: The current study is an action research study. It was conducted in the GR sessions of the Gastroenterology department of Al-Zahra Hospital affiliated with Isfahan University of Medical Sciences in 2017. Participants included attending physicians, fellowship students of the Gastroenterology departments, a CI, and two supervising medical librarians. Data were collected through observation and discussion. Qualitative content analysis and concept mapping were used for data analysis.
   RESULTS: The findings indicated that existing problems were related to the CI, medical team, and infrastructural ones. The participation of the CI in medical team was arranged based on the following steps: planning, action, evaluation, and suggestions. It started from an initial diagnosis of patients and ended in GR meetings. During evaluation step, suggestions were made to remove the existing problems and in the fifth step, results were summarized and a framework for the participation of the CI in GR sessions was suggested.
   CONCLUSIONS: Medical team members were satisfied with the participation of the CI, but it is necessary to remove the existing structural and personal barriers (related to the CI and medical team members), in order to improve the efficiency of this participation.

AB  - As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience specifically on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simplified complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

We describe this knowledge according to three domains, namely (1) content knowledge (CK), (2) pedagogical content knowledge (PCK), and (3) curricular knowledge (CuK). We hypothesise a positive relationship between these three domains and students' performance in science. Students' science performance was conceptualised by system thinking performance in the context of biology teaching. In order to test our hypothesis, we examined the relationship between the knowledge triplet CK, PCK, and CuK and students' performance. 48 biology teachers and their students (N = 1036) participated in this study. Teachers' content-related professional knowledge and students' performance were measured by paper-and-pencil tests. Moreover, we used concept maps to further assess students' performance. By specifying doubly latent models, we found a significant positive relationship between biology teachers' PCK and students' performance. On the contrary, the results reveal no relationship between CK and CuK and students' performance. These findings are discussed in respect to modelling the interrelationship of teachers' content-related professional knowledge and students' learning in science, as well as concerning their relevance for further research and teacher education programmes.

AB  - Research into learning in informal settings such as museums has been in a formative state during the past decade, and much of that research has been descriptive and lacking a theory base. In this article, it is proposed that the human constructivist view of teaming can guide research and assist the interpretation of research data because it recognizes an individual's prior knowledge and active involvement in knowledge construction during a museum visit. This proposal is supported by reference to the findings of a previously reported interpretive case study, which included concept mapping and semistructured interviews, of the knowledge transformations of three Year 7 students who had participated in a class visit to a science museum and associated postvisit activities. The findings from that study are shown in this report to be consistent with the human constructivist view of learning in that for all three students, learning was found to be at times incremental and at other times to involve substantial restructuring of knowledge. Thus, we regard that the human constructivist view of learning has much merit and utility for researchers investigating the development of knowledge and understanding emergent from experiences in informal settings. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings for teachers and staff of museums and similar institutions are also discussed. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - The term describing the students' notions of scientific concepts dissimilar from scientifically acceptable by the scientist is still debated. This study explores of how scientific concepts performed by high school students (HSSs), pre-service teachers (PSTs), and in-service teachers (ISTs) simultaneously to make clear between their conception vs. scientists' conception, especially in the ionization energy concept. Therefore, it is crucial to raise the position of scientific conception and misconception. For diagnosing the misconceptions, some methods can be used: concept maps, interviews, multiple-choice tests (one-tier), multiple-tier tests (two-tier, three-tier, fourtiers), open-ended tests, and others. This study utilized multiple-tier tests with three-tier. Totally, 326 participants from Indonesia, including 118 HSSs, 165 PSTs, and 43 ISTs majoring in chemistry, were invited to complete an online -Ionization Energy Diagnostic-Modification (IEDI*M) test. The test consisted of 12 three-tier diagnostic items. The study indicated four substantial alternative conceptions were acknowledged: conservation of energy, half-filled sub-shells or stable fully-filled, octet rule framework, and relation-based reasoning. ISTs performed better than HSSs and PSTs on the understanding of ionization energy. The study has also specified the distribution of ionization energy conceptions of Group 1 and 2, and Period 2 and 3 on the periodic system. By utilizing the IEDI*M, the percentages of alternative concepts decreased from one-tier to two-tier and from two-tier to three-tier. This study gives some implications for the government, policy-makers, chemistry teachers, preservice teachers, and university faculty members.

AB  - Online discussions can be used to promote students' ability on knowledge integration. However, almost all the web based online forums are text based. In physics, information about a physics system was represented in many different ways: using words, equations, graphs, diagrams, table of numbers, contour maps, vector plots, and so on. We saw a need for web based tools which user not only can view graphics and animations with their browser, but also can create and edit graphics online with the same browser. With modem DHTML feature of web browser, we have developed a web based tools, which integrated a(1)WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) HTML editor with SVG (scalable Vector Graphic) editor and mathematic equation editor. It is currently used on our internet-based courses system by many science teachers. User can edit text, simple shape drawing, animated mathematics function plot, flow-chart, concept maps and Vee-Map dynamically online with internet explorer. Just by looking at our online instruction, high school students already use our tools to create graphic representations in their forum messages. The tool bar interfaces make it attractive and easy to learn/use for new user. They found it simple, user-friendly, easy to learn and useful. A research project is underway to study how teachers implement our tool in their online web courses.

AB  - This study investigates critical thinking (CT) studies in e-learning settings to provide a comprehensive analysis of CT studies. Research indexed in the Web of Science database which includes major peer-reviewed social sciences citation index journals in the e-learning field from January 2006 to November 2017 was searched for a systematic review and analysis. A total of 42 studies were selected and synthesized. The distribution of publishing years, geographical areas, education sectors, publications, disciplines, research methods, activities, CT measurement instruments, teaching instruction, the CT roles applied in the studies, and the experiment durations were reviewed. The results showed that most CT studies were conducted in nontraditional teaching environments using strategies such as online discussion or concept mapping; the most used quantitative method was the California critical thinking skills test (CCTST), whereas the most frequently adopted qualitative method was the practical inquiry model of cognitive presence (PIMCP). The common method to enhance students' CT was online synchronous or asynchronous discussion, and the role that CT played in these studies was as a dependent variable for evaluating whether the designed e-learning instruction(s) can cultivate CT. This study concludes that with active learning instruction and experienced tutor facilitation, students' CT could be enhanced in a variety of e-learning environments.

AB  - We studied the occurrence and nature of learning in a university first year Introduction to Geomorphology course, and its relations with prior knowledge taught in a prerequisite course, and with the prior knowledge in the to be learned subjects. Ten dimensions of knowledge were tapped before and after the course by conventional and cognitive structure measures that were derived by the concept mapping methodology. The fine-grain analysis of learning outcomes yielded the following results: (a) students acquired only a small portion of the content in the course Introduction to Geomorphology, (b) the prior geological and geomorphological knowledge did not affect the learning of the new geomorphological contents, (c) the minor effects appeared within rather than across knowledge dimensions, and they affected mainly the learning of smaller knowledge units, and (d) concept definition cannot be considered a valid probe of knowledge. The differential effects of prior knowledge question the central, global and undifferentiated role that schema theories ascribe to prior knowledge in future learning. They call for greater reference to the exposed dimensions of knowledge by suggesting additional factors to be considered in the sequencing of courses, as well as to the acquisition of complex knowledge with partial meaning of the basic knowledge units, and the use of new cognitive structure probes of knowledge.

AB  - Engaging end-users effectively in the construction process is becoming increasingly important in the UK. However, this engagement is often hindered by the amount and complexity of information and knowledge that needs to be communicated among project stakeholders. This can often create a 'mismatch' between stakeholders' expectations and the physical building constructed. A survey was carried out in two secondary schools in the North West of the UK to determine whether a 'mismatch' existed. An nD-based computer game was suggested to address this mismatch, the rubrics of which aimed to facilitate the early engagement of endusers in the construction process by providing 'what-if' analysis through visually shareable information. This approach was regarded as a self-learning tool, through which end-users could learn about the complexity of the construction process and the decisions and trade-offs being made. This research targeted school children (aged 11-16) as the end-users, under the Building Schools for the Future initiative funded by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. In order to simplify the information communicated to school children, a concept map was developed to identify the interrelationship between the nD concept, the gaming technology concept and the school building design concept. These interrelationships were used to inform the secondary phase of this research (unreported) which will be the actual development of the computer game.

AB  - This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0-5 years, 6-14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas.

AB  - The ability to monitor the status of one's own understanding is important to accomplish academic tasks proficiently. Previous studies have shown that comprehension monitoring (metacomprehension accuracy) is generally poor, but improves when readers engage in activities that access valid cues reflecting their situation model (activities such as concept mapping or self-explaining). However, the question still remains as to which process, encoding or retrieving, causes the improvement of metacomprehension accuracy, and the findings of previous research on this matter have been inconsistent. This study examined whether college students' metacomprehension accuracy improves when they expect, at the time of reading, that they will explain the content later (active encoding) or when they actually generate an explanation (encoding plus active retrieving). In the experiments, college students read five texts. During reading, some students expected that they would generate explanations but did not actually generate them. In contrast, some students actually generated an explanation of the text after reading. All students then rated their comprehension of each text. Finally, they completed tests on the materials. Results of both studies revealed that metacomprehension accuracy, operationalized as the association between comprehension ratings and test performance, was greater for the group that actually generated explanations than for the expectancy or control groups.

AB  - This study explored the pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) and its development of four experienced biology teachers in the context of teaching school genetics. PCK was defined in terms of teacher content knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of students' preconceptions and learning difficulties. Data sources of teacher knowledge base included teacher-constructed concept maps, pre- and post-lesson teacher interviews, video-recorded genetics lessons, post-lesson teacher questionnaire and document analysis of teacher's reflective journals and students' work samples. The results showed that the teachers' individual PCK profiles consisted predominantly of declarative and procedural content knowledge in teaching basic genetics concepts. Conditional knowledge, which is a type of meta-knowledge for blending together declarative and procedural knowledge, was also demonstrated by some teachers. Furthermore, the teachers used topic-specific instructional strategies such as context-based teaching, illustrations, peer teaching, and analogies in diverse forms but failed to use physical models and individual or group student experimental activities to assist students' internalization of the concepts. The finding that all four teachers lacked knowledge of students' genetics-related preconceptions was equally significant. Formal university education, school context, journal reflection and professional development programmes were considered as contributing to the teachers' continuing PCK development. Implications of the findings for biology teacher education are briefly discussed.

AB  - Research apprenticeships for secondary students provide authentic contexts for learning science in which students engage in scientific investigations with practicing scientists in working laboratory groups. Student experiences in these research apprenticeships vary depending on the individual nature of the laboratory in which students have been placed. This study explores potential relationships among student experiences in apprenticeship contexts and desired student outcomes (e.g. science content knowledge, understandings of nature of science, and aspirations for science oriented career plans). The following two research questions guided the study: How do participant experiences in and outcomes resulting from an authentic research program for high school students vary? How does variation in participant experiences in an authentic research program relate to participant outcomes? Primary data sources were student and mentor interviews in addition to student generated concept maps. Results indicated that the greatest variance in student experiences existed in the categories of collaboration, epistemic involvement, and understandings of the significance of research results. The greatest variation in desired student outcomes was observed in student understandings of nature of science and in students' future science plans. Results suggested that collaboration and interest in the project were experience aspects most likely to be related to desired outcomes. Implications for the design of research apprenticeships for secondary students are discussed.

AB  - In the present paper, we focus on conceptual mapping. This is a method that performs product analysis of the verbal activity of student. It serves as a graphical representation of the content structure. The concept map expresses a hierarchical arrangement of terms as well as relationships and links between them. Our work aimed to create a model of a conceptual map that should have function as a scientific conceptual map. It contains all the energy concepts that pupils should involve in their knowledge structure. Based on content analysis of textbooks used in elementary schools, we have included concepts not only of physics but also of various disciplines. The second aim was to find out the correspondence between the model scientific conceptual map and the map created in the mind of students. The results reflect valuable information for the teacher - whether the students have in their minds a conceptual network of this knowledge focused on the concept of energy. Based on this comparison, we found out which concepts the students used and recovered from their long-term memory. Another element to which we have focused our attention was the hierarchical layout of the concepts in the map created in the mind of the students. Through this research, we have identified if students can perceive energy within a single comprehensive view at the level of their education.

AB  - Students may acquire mislearnings in the course of their academic lives for various reasons and keep them for a lifetime. Some of the most common of those mislearnings are the alternative conceptions university students have about Biology lesson. This study was conducted through one-to-one interviews with 54 students at the 1st grade of the Department of Classroom Teaching in order to determine university students' alternative learnings about the classification and the diversity of plants and remove these alternative learnings if there were any. In the end, it was found that students had mislearnings about the classification and the diversity of plants. The main mislearning was that students classify some of the plants they knew well in a wrong way according to the criteria which was not biological; for example, they thought fern and bryophyte were plants with seeds, fungi were plants, and the plants belonging to the family of Pinaceae did not have real leaves so they were included in the class of plants without seeds. In order to remove these mislearnings 'Porphyrios Tree', which has a structure similar to a concept map, was used. As a result, a great majority of pre-service teachers' alternative conceptions about the classification of plants were removed through this method of application.

AB  - The development of understanding in the discipline of security science is just beginning. As the academic research on defining the domain of security science continues, so does the development of learning security-related concepts in the understanding of the knowledge structure. This study has considered a methodology for the portrayal of knowledge structures in the domain of electronic security and its associated concepts. It seeks to examine the understanding of novice learners' perceptions of electronic security concepts through the knowledge structure approach. The multidimensional scaling technique has been applied to dissimilarity measures on a selection of concepts from the domain of electronic security. These concepts were considered as key ideas in the learning of electronic security. The formal knowledge structure for electronic security concepts was mapped for an expert group that was most familiar with the understanding of this domain of security science. In addition, two student groups from the Singapore Institute of Technical Education participated in the study, and produced concept maps for the same electronic security concepts. The structures of the novice groups when compared to the expert group lacked the definition of clusters of related concepts, and were interpreted as lacking the understanding of experts in this knowledge domain.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the effectiveness of teaching based on conceptual change overcome misconceptions of 9th grade high school students about the subject of air pressure. The sampling of the study was formed with two classes of 9th grade students from a general high school in the city-center of Trabzon. A quasi-experimental method was used in the study as a research design. One of the classes that was selected for the study was chosen as a control group [n=45], and the other class was chosen as an experiment group [n=45]. White conceptual change texts and concept maps were used to teach air pressure subject to the experiment group, traditional teaching methods were used to teach the same subject to the control group. For the purpose of collecting data, Success Test and Concept Test were implemented. The control and experiment groups' pre-test and post-test scores were analyzed by t test. Analysis of the data showed that there was not a statistically significant difference between the control and the experiment group in the pre-test in terms of the concept understanding achievement. However, post-test results showed that there was a significant difference in favor of the experiment group. It was concluded that teaching methods and materials based on conceptual change were more effective than traditional teaching methods to teach air pressure subject.

AB  - Background and purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate and identify the nature and the interrelatedness of pre-service teachers' misconceptions and scientific concepts for explaining dissolving before, during, and after a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the intervention.
   Sample, design, and methods: Guided by Vygotsky's theory of concept development, the study focused specifically on the spontaneous, and spontaneous pseudo-concepts held by the 61 elementary pre-service teachers during a 15-week science methods course. Data included concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, drawings, and narratives, and were thematically analyzed to classify concepts and interrelatedness.
   Results: Results of the study showed that spontaneous pseudo-concepts (1) dominated pre-service teachers' understandings about dissolving throughout the study, and (2) were simply associated with scientific concepts during and after the intervention.
   Conclusion: Collectively, the results indicated that the pre-service teachers' did not acquire a unified system of knowledge about dissolving that could be characterized as abstract, generalizable, and hierarchical. Implications include the need for (1) familiarity with pre-service teachers' prior knowledge about science content; (2) a variety of formative assessments to assess their misconceptions; (3) emphasizing the importance of dialectical method for concept development during instruction; and (4) skillful content instructors.

AB  - Spatial representations have been considered for their high didactical efficacy, as concept maps and mind maps. Graphical and spatial representations may be seen as key elements of knowledge management and may contribute to enhancing spatial knowledge. Even if isomorphisms between the physical and the mental dimension can be controversial in the field of spatial knowledge, it is nevertheless interesting to study the role of spatial interpretation in knowledge management processes. In science education, spatial skills are actually highly required due to the development of new technologies and their highly demanding spatial tasks they often work intertwined with other abilities, such as logical reasoning and verbal skills. Despite spatial knowledge being significative in the overall field of learning management, there is instead little research that shows its complex role in the comprehension of concepts in the humanistic fields, e.g. in philosophical conceptual reasoning. The Elementary Logic Theory-which underlies the philosophical maps of this Atlas-identifies at the basis of complex thinking prototypical knowledge units that may be activated in the possible collaboration between explicit and implicit thinking. In EL Theory, spatiality is considered the most suitable transition format for the hypothesized collaboration between implicit and explicit processing because it shares common aspects with both of them. The focus of EL Theory is to research particularly the role of the implicit in knowledge comprehension through spatial representations. In this Atlas, the role of Elementary Logic Theory is highlighted in shaping philosophical knowledge and comprehension of philosophical concepts and their intertwining.

AB  - The paper describes the combined use of qualitative and quantitative methods to provide a preliminary definition of the construct, the reasons for divorce among Israeli Arab women. The qualitative methods consisted of personal interviews and a focus group, the quantitative method of Trochim's concept mapping. The combined approach was adopted in the wake of skepticism about the ability of research instruments developed in the West to study Western populations to provide valid and reliable assessments of non-Western groups. A culturally sensitive definition of the construct was sought as a first step in the design of a culturally sensitive research instrument for a study of divorce among Israeli Arabs to be carried out by a number of Arab and Jewish scholars in Israel.
   The findings support the authors' initial intuition that the reasons that lead Israeli Arab women to divorce are different from those that motivate middle class Western women. While the latter tend to be motivated by emotional reasons,from poor communication and desire for self-fulfillment, the Muslim Arab women who divorce are moved by really extreme marital misery brought on by a high degree of physical violence, sexual torment, emotional abuse, and/or the mental illness or addiction of their partners, as well as by the active intervention of their in-laws to break up their marriage.

AB  - To explore the ways in which teacher-guided and student-centered instructional approaches influence students' conceptual understanding of seasonal change, we designed a technology-enhanced learning (TEL) course to compare, by means of concept maps, the learning outcome of students in two groups: a teacher-guided (TG) class (with whole-class presentations) and a student-centered (SC) class (with individual online learning). The participants were two classes of second-year senior high school students in Taiwan. Overall, the results showed that most students developed a deep and accessible understanding of the reasons for the seasons after undergoing experiences provided by the TEL course. More importantly, it was found that, in this technologically enhanced environment. the student-centered approach was more effective than the teacher-guided approach in altering students' alternative conceptions of seasonal change (F=28.05, p < 0.001), The conceptual evolution of students in the two groups was plotted and compared. These plots indicated that, first of all, the cognitive processes of contextualization and sense making helped students re-examine their old ideas about the phenomena, leading them to generate alternative conceptions and undergo both positive and negative conceptual change. The student-centered approach allows students to more freely test their own hypotheses in the processes of exploration and modeling, and thus move from assimilatory to properly scientific explanations.

AB  - Over the past two decades, science educators increasingly have become interested in the role of language in the learning of science and have drawn on the work of Bakhtin, among others, for understanding the dialogical nature of knowledge in a sociocultural framework. However, the nature of language and its relation to thinking have not substantially changed and, in many ways, are incommensurable with the cultural-historical, materialist dialectical underpinning of the original framing of the sociocultural and dialogical approaches in the theories of L. S. Vygotsky and M. M. Bakhtin and his circle (e. g., V.N. Volosinov). Most importantly, currently available analyses of science classroom talk do not appear to exhibit sufficient appreciation of the fact that words, statements, and language are living phenomena, that is, they inherently change in speaking. In this paper, I begin by working out the premise that language is a living phenomenon that changes in use. I then present two key insights on language-in-use that derive from the works of Vygotsky and the Bakhtin circle, which are used to develop a theoretical and methodological frame. These key insights and the theoretical aspects of this paper are exemplified with materials from a concept mapping session in a 12th-grade physics course. The proposed model has considerable implications for theorizing the relation between classroom talk and formal written genres of expression, and gives rise to many new research questions.

AB  - This article demonstrates that didactic videos have the potential to enhance quality perception, performance and interest in engineering education. Emergency Remote Learning (ERL) imposed challenging conditions on education, and its impact was especially noticeable in the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) disciplines. This is mainly due to intrinsic cognitive load associated with the high presence of abstract concepts and to difficulties to establish connections among subjects to foster generative processing. Suitable integration of multimedia resources might be beneficial in both regards. The use of didactic videos as pedagogical aid is expected to yield positive results in electrical engineering education, mitigating the impact caused by ERL situations. Using concept maps to identify key concepts in the Electrical Engineering BSc, this article proposes the creation and integration of nine videos to enhance conceptual learning and the creation of links among subjects. This study encompassed three academic years (from 2019 to 2022), covering pre-ERL, ERL and post-ERL scenarios, and considering a total sample of 157 students. By using a Mixed Methods research design, this study has demonstrated how the integration of didactic videos mitigated the negative effects of the unprecedented ERL conditions, with positive impact on students' perception on videos' implications in enhancing their interest and understanding of the subject's concepts.

TI  - When the light bulb turns on: motivation and collaboration spark the creation of ideas for theoretical physicists
T2  - 2021 PHYSICS EDUCATION RESEARCH CONFERENCE (PERC)
CP  - Physics Education Research Conference (PERC) - Making Physics More Inclusive and Eliminating Exclusionary Practices in Physics
AB  - In this project, we sought to uncover the cognitive processes and skills that are involved in completing a theoretical physics project. Theoretical physics is often portrayed as a field requiring individual genius and can seem inaccessible to undergraduate students, as well as the public. We drew upon the foundations of Cognitive Task Analysis and completed semi-structured interviews with eleven theoretical physics faculty members from several different research institutions who specialized in subfields including quantum optics, biophysics, computational astrophysics, and string theory. We analyzed the processes and skills of these physicists, focusing on an analysis of idea origin, which is typically the first cognitive process within a project, and how it was connected to collaboration and motivation. We used concept maps to organize these codes and portray the factors that influence the creation of project ideas. We found that motivation and collaboration are fundamental determinants of project ideas and their origins, which contradicts the "lone genius" stereotype. These findings on cognitive processes and skills can help us understand how to better prepare students to do theoretical physics research. Finally, the information gathered during this project may be useful for improving the public understanding of theoretical physics, dispelling the belief that the field requires "genius," and making it accessible to more students.

KW  - self-regulated learning
AB  - This study focuses on the competencies selecting learning strategies and applying learning strategies, which are required for successful self-regulated learning with expository texts, the spontaneous application of these two learning strategies, and their relationship to learning outcomes. The aim of the study was to evaluate new tests that assess both competencies and to analyze whether the independent assessment of both competencies can be used to identify learning deficiencies (e. g., production deficiency). The reported results are based on a sample of 559 German ninth grade high-school students. The mean age of the sample was 14.92 years (SD = 0.52) with 52.1% of the students being female. In order to initiate self-regulated learning and to assess the individual learning outcome, an expository science text was given to the students asking them to individually learn its main points. Based on a random sample of 103 students, the spontaneous use of learning strategies was recorded. In addition, the competencies selecting learning strategies and applying learning strategies (using the subordinated competencies applying the text-highlighting-strategy and applying the concept-mapping-strategy) were assessed using newly developed/adapted tests. The results of a multiple regression analysis revealed that, apart from prior knowledge, the competencies selecting learning strategies and applying the text-highlighting-strategy were predictive for students' learning outcome. Furthermore, the suitability of the new tests using the text-highlighting-strategy to identify learning deficiencies could be demonstrated.

AB  - It is important for the higher education institutions nowadays, to consider and provide various strategies to achieve learning outcomes of the program and to enrich the undergraduate experience. According to past literatures, active learning strategies were found to be superior in enhancing the student engagement and attention compared to the traditional lectures. This paper shares the experience of active learning from the teaching perspective through my self-reflection on the usage of various active learning activities at a private university in Malaysia to enhance the undergraduate medical student engagement and learning experience. The provision of useful pre-learning materials such as online videos, quizzes, reading articles and clinical scenarios assist better understanding of the topic before the real active session and enrich critical thinking and problem-solving skills. During the active session, the usage of team activities improves collaborative, cooperative learning and team work. The students get opportunity to engage in the learning activities and discussion among them which encourages higher order thinking and deeper learning. In addition, the usage of available technology with live interactive audience participation to share the group discussions and to project the correct answers further supports the learning activities. Drawing, annotating the diagrams and concept maps assists better understanding of the basic concepts and mechanism of actions of the drugs. The relevant examples of clinical cases are useful for integration of basic science and clinical application which reinforces learning. The challenges include time for preparation, planning and designing the sessions, training the academics, feasibility of technology and concerns on the content coverage.

AB  - Sustainability is a systems problem with interconnected socio-economic-ecological factors. To advance sustainable infrastructure, engineers are expected to more quickly think in systems from individual components to relationships between them. Until recently, understanding of cognition for sustainability was limited to investigating behavior and its outcomes. However, the emergence of neuroimaging techniques enables the collection of objective physiological data in the brain. By measuring the cognitive activation, we can construct a more detailed understanding of the mental processes during systems and linear thinking tasks related to engineering sustainability. Wearing a functional near infrared spectroscopy system, which measures changes in hemodynamic response, engineering students (n = 17) developed both lists and concept maps related to sustainability topics. The results show that systems thinking leads to more concepts generated and requires more cognitive activation in Brodmann area (BA) 46 (BA46 is associated with cognitive flexibility) while less activation in BA39 (associated with sequence and visuospatial processing). Moreover, the brain network analysis indicates the cognitive barriers for engineering students to think in systems for sustainability with lower global efficiency to cognitively integrate information and lower clustering coefficient to separately deal with information in the brain compared to linear thinking. This study is the first step in constructing a better cognition model and brain networks of systems thinking for sustainability. The next step can be how education training cognitively improves systems thinking among engineering students.

AB  - Antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) are targeted immunoconjugate constructs that integrate the potency of cytotoxic drugs with the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies, minimizing damage to healthy cells and reducing systemic toxicity. Their design allows for higher doses of the cytotoxic drug to be administered, potentially increasing efficacy. They are currently among the most promising drug classes in oncology, with efforts to expand their application for nononcological indications and in combination therapies. Here we provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in ADC research and consider future directions and challenges in promoting this promising platform to widespread therapeutic use. We examine data from the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific information, and analyze the publication landscape of recent research to reveal the exploration trends in published documents and to provide insights into the scientific advances in the area. We also discuss the evolution of the key concepts in the field, the major technologies, and their development pipelines with company research focuses, disease targets, development stages, and publication and investment trends. A comprehensive concept map has been created based on the documents in the CAS Content Collection. We hope that this report can serve as a useful resource for understanding the current state of knowledge in the field of ADCs and the remaining challenges to fulfill their potential.

AB  - Objective: The consumption of anabolic steroids (AS) has been growing continuously in recent years. It has gone beyond the sports world; AS are now widely used as drugs of abuse in connection with bodybuilding. This study sets out to assess the state of scientific research in the area.
   Design: Bibliometrics were employed to evaluate the literature retrieved from the principal relevant bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, SportDiscus, the Science Citation Index Expanded and the Social Sciences Citation Index. The core journals were identified along with the leading authors and research groups and their institutional affiliations. Techniques based on social network analysis were applied in order to build up a concept map of research.
   Results: 1325 documents were retrieved. They were produced by 3131 different researchers giving a Collaboration Index of 3.32. The institutions with the most productive authors were Ball State University (Muncie, IN, USA), the Ecole Nationale Veterinaire de Nantes (ENVN), the Institut Municipal dInvestigacio Medica (IMIM) (Barcelona, Spain), the Institute of Biochemistry of the German Sport University Cologne (DSHS), Iowa State University, Maastricht University and the University of Iowa.
   Conclusions: It was concluded that there has been an upward trend in the number of research projects. The sources used complemented one another, as 78.04% of the documents retrieved were unique to one source. The productivity ranking was headed by sports medicine journals, followed by journals of chemistry, physiology, endocrinology and substance abuse. Besides sporting activities, the most important research clusters were those connected with bodybuilding and with youth groups.

AB  - The paper details an exploratory qualitative study that investigated 61 prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving salt and sugar in water respectively. The study was set within a 15-week elementary science methods course that included a 5E learning cycle lesson on dissolving, the instructional context. Oversby's (Prim Sci Rev 63:6-19, 2002, Aspects of teaching secondary science, Routledge Falmer, London, 2002) ladder of explanations for the context of dissolving, current scientific explanations for dissolving and perspectives on conceptions and misconceptions provided the unified framework for the study. Concept maps, interview transcripts, written artifacts, and drawings and narratives were used as data to investigate these prospective teachers' conceptual understanding of dissolving throughout the 15-weeks of the methods course. Analysis revealed that participants' explanations of dissolving were predominantly descriptive explanations (39 %) and interpretative explanations (38 %), with lower percentage occurrences of intentional (14 %) and cause and effect (9 %) level explanations. Most of these explanations were also constructed by a set of loosely connected and reinforcing everyday concepts abstracted from common everyday experiences making them misconceptions. Implications include: (1) the need for science teacher educators to use multiple platforms to derive their prospective elementary teachers' conceptual understandings of science content; and (2) to identify and help them identify their own scientific conceptions and misconceptions and how they influence the construction of scientific/nonscientific explanations. Science teacher educators also need to emphasize the role of meaningful frameworks associated with the concept that is being introduced during the Engage phase of the 5E learning cycle. This is important because, relevant prior knowledge is associated with the knowledge of the particle theory of matter and both are part of larger knowledge system comprised of interrelated scientific concepts.

AB  - Conceptual maps are being introduced in the different educational levels demonstrating a great potential to improve the teaching-learning processes. From the formation of Secondary Education teachers, we want to contribute to the improvement of teaching quality by introducing resources for didactic innovation in the classroom. The design of learning itineraries based on conceptual maps and networks is analyzed in order to propose a more flexible instructional design that makes learning more significant and focused on the student and generating non-linear processes. The use of concept maps in the classroom helps us to overcome learning difficulties related to the complexity of the subject we are going to discuss, and to show the contents in a more related and systemic way. In this case, such as the Carbon Cycle, complex elements and processes are combined, so it requires a great deal of abstraction for their understanding. We expect future high school students to understand the carbon cycle from a more inclusive perspective by incorporating geological, biological, physical and chemical aspects and to assess the global disturbance that the carbon cycle is experiencing in the present and future consequences. The proposal project is based on a constructive and reflective approach to scientific education and teacher training, which tries to encourage individual thoughts, team work, social interaction in the classroom and collective debate, as necessary conditions for the transfer and construction of ideas about the complexity of the teaching profession.

AB  - This paper explores the occurrence of conceptual incoherence in upper secondary school textbooks resulting from the use of multiple historical models. Swedish biology and chemistry textbooks, as well as a selection of books from English speaking countries, were examined. The purpose of the study was to identify which models are used to represent the phenomenon of gene function in textbooks and to investigate how these models relate to historical scientific models and subject matter contexts. Models constructed for specific use in textbooks were identified using concept mapping. The data were further analyzed by content analysis. The study shows that several different historical models are used in parallel in textbooks to describe gene function. Certain historical models were used more often then others and the most recent scientific views were rarely referred to in the textbooks. Hybrid models were used frequently, i.e. most of the models in the textbooks consisted of a number of components of several historical models. Since the various historical models were developed as part of different scientific frameworks, hybrid models exhibit conceptual incoherence, which may be a source of confusion for students. Furthermore, the use of different historical models was linked to particular subject contexts in the textbooks studied. The results from Swedish and international textbooks were similar, indicating the general applicability of our conclusions.

T2  - SCIENCE EDUCATION
KW  - BEHAVIOR
AB  - This article reports on part of a larger study of how 11- and 12-year-old students construct knowledge about electricity and magnetism by drawing on aspects of their experiences during the course of a school visit to an interactive science museum and subsequent classroom activities linked to the science museum exhibits. The significance of this study is that it focuses on an aspect of school visits to informal learning centers that has been neglected by researchers in the past, namely the influence of post-visit activities in the classroom on subsequent learning and knowledge construction. This study provides evidence that the integrated series of post-visit activities resulted in students constructing and reconstructing their personal knowledge of science concepts and principles represented in the science museum exhibits, sometimes toward the accepted scientific understanding and sometimes in different and surprising ways. A descriptive interpretive approach was adopted, with principal data sources comprising student-generated concept maps and semistructured interviews at three stages of the study. Findings demonstrate the interrelationships between learning that occurs at school, home, and in informal learning settings. The study also underscores for classroom teachers and staff of science museums and similar centers the importance of planning pre- and post-visit activities. The importance of this planning is not only to support the development of scientific conceptions, but also to detect and respond to alternative conceptions that may be produced or strengthened during a visit to an informal learning center.

AB  - Online learning has been applied in various educational institutions, and have some positive effects on the conventional learning, especially if both learning is collaborated. Online learning helps teaching difficulties in conventional learning where learning process of individual student is hard to know in detailed by the teacher because of too many students in a single class. With online learning assisted by Learning Management System (LMS) teachers can know each student individual learning process by analyzing student log activity on the LMS which is often called by behavioral tracking. LMS used as research material is Moodle that has been applied to the Computer Science Education Department, UPI. The purpose of this research is to find learning status of each student by analyzing student's behavior while using the Moodle LMS. One of behavioral tracking model which can be used to determine the student's learning status is Monitoring Online Course with Log Data (MOCLog) model. By combining the concept map, and solution map, this model can analyze log data on Moodle LMS, and generate learning status of each individual student. Then the teacher can determine what behavioral traits are dominant, and most influential on learning with association rule data mining technique with apriori algorithms. This study provides that dominant learning status on the Computer Network course with 84.75 % students is Normal Learning Status while Frequent Access the Course to be an activity that greatly affect the student's learning status in the Moodle LMS course with 48 students.

AB  - The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. On the one hand, the investigation of such abilities is the purview of psychology; on the other hand, subject-specific educational research is also of interest, as a number of research works in the field of science education show. For computer science education, no corresponding studies are currently available. However, investigating how learners build categories from a choice of given terms may be useful for several reasons; for example, learners' perspectives on relations between terms, as well as potential misconceptions, can be detected and made available to educators aiming to improve lesson planning. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study with 490 German students from primary to higher education, in which we presented them with 23 information technology-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) on a questionnaire, with the task of assigning these to self-defined categories (and then giving their categories individual names). In the results, we identified a number of potential categorization strategies the participants might have used to categorize the given terms; these include generalization, purpose, place of use, state, part-whole relationships, and association. Recognizing and defining such categorization strategies can help teachers construct learner-adequate concept maps of the domain, which helps foster the elaboration of learners' knowledge structures in this field. We found that the younger participants used less abstract names for their categories, and observed that some participants had difficulty categorizing some terms (such as robot and 3D).

AB  - Significant efforts in the past decades to teach evidence-based practice (EBP) implementation has emphasized increasing knowledge of EBP and developing interventions to support adoption to practice. These efforts have resulted in only limited sustained improvements in the daily use of evidence-based interventions in clinical practice in most health professions. Many new interventions with limited evidence of effectiveness are readily adopted each year-indicating openness to change is not the problem. The selection of an intervention is the outcome of an elaborate and complex cognitive process, which is shaped by how they represent the problem in their mind and is mostly invisible processes to others. Therefore, the complex thinking process that support appropriate adoption of interventions should be taught more explicitly. Making the process visible to clinicians increases the acquisition of the skills required to judiciously select one intervention over others. The purpose of this paper is to provide a review of the selection process and the critical analysis that is required to appropriately decide to trial or not trial new intervention strategies with patients.

AB  - This study investigated the attitudes and achievements 13/14-year-old pupils' in palaeontology with respect to school type, gender and pupils' perception of palaeontology teacher. Palaeontology provides important evidence to support t he theory of evolution thus it is important for science educator to understand the attitudes held by their pupils in this science topic. A factor analysis applied to a 23 Likert - type palaeontology attitude questionnaire extracted five independent factors that represent pupils' school and out of school attitudes, attitudes to future career in palaeontology and perception of teacher's involvement in palaeontology. A spider type concept map was designed to examine pupils' understanding of prehistoric life in the main geological eras. It was found that grammar school pupils palaeontology and also had better achievement when compared to elementary school pupils. Perception of a teacher were shown to exert showed only a weak effect on pupils' attitudes, but the same variable, teacher attitude, strongly influenced pupils' achievement. Differences caused according to the gender of the showed a weak tendency for a better score in attitudes and better score in achievement for females. These results imply that the greater the teacher's involvement in science the more positively influenced is the pupils' learning outcomes and the stronger the link between teacher and pupils' interest results in a positive influences on pupils' attitudes.

AB  - For students of the last course and future civil engineers, it is often difficult to learn subjects related to the environmental impacts that may suffer the ecosystems. These subjects are related to ecology rather than engineering, so even the basic concepts necessary to understand the matter should be explained beforehand. For this reason, the teacher should strive for the outset to motivate students. This has been done on the subject "Environmental Impact of Hydraulic Engineering", subject of the final year of Hydraulic field (30 students more or less). This subject consists of 4.5 credits, of which only 2.5 are theoretical credits. The remaining 2 credits are for practical sessions (classroom, laboratory and computing).
   This article shows how to raise the subject with the goal that students enjoy learning. In the first part of the semester, is taught the theory, necessary and essential for further learning. In this case, different tools have been used, from traditional lecture to the use of concept maps, even using visual tools such as videos and photographs of real cases. The way to assess this theoretical part has changed over the years. The early years, typical written exams were done, since objective exams with open response to multiple choice exams. Other years, concept maps have been used as a tool, not only to impart knowledge but also as an evaluation tool. In recent courses, the theoretical part is not evaluated as such. The student is aware of the need to learn the theoretical knowledge in order to apply the practical part. So, it has been seen that it is not necessary to evaluate this theoretical knowledge. They are motivated to learn themselves and when the practical part begins all students have understood such knowledge. Theory underlies the practice, and all students would pass a theoretical exam in the case of performing it and without being overwhelmed by that exam.
   The second part of the semester is focused on the practical part, where students work at practical classes, computer and laboratory. In this part, the main objective is that students learn to work in small groups, make use of independent and collaborative work, consolidate knowledge and be aware of the importance of the environment and its need of protection. These objectives are reflected in the three types of practices. This part is assessed by the delivery of some reports, and through the group-work done and its exposition.
   During the first years, an evaluation was made of the theoretical part, and the motivation to learn from the students was very low, their motivation was simply to pass. In the last years in which the theory has been arisen simply as an aid to learn, it has been shown that students are more participatory in class, more motivated and eager to learn, once they are released from the stress of the exam. The students experience have been rewarding in recent courses. That is evident in recent teacher assessment questionnaires, which have grown up from a value of 7 to a value of 9 (out of 10). Students have been motivated, have learned and have also enjoyed.

AB  - This study seeks to develop and validate a model of living values-based interactive multimedia in Civic Education learning. A Research and Development approach was employed. Data were gathered through observations, interviews, document study, focus group discussions, and questionnaires Data were analyzed by way of interactive models and a descriptive quantitative analysis. The subjects were students and teachers at junior high schools and senior high schools in Bandung, Indonesia. Results reveal that: i) the model conceptually integrates living values and the principles of living values education into interactive multimedia with especial attention to core competencies and basic competencies of Civic Education according to the 2013 curriculum of Indonesia, the principles of scientific learning, and the principles of interactive multimedia development; ii) the framework of the model consists of motivation, title, menu, CC-BC (Core Competencies and Basic Competencies) and learning objectives, concept maps, material contents with multimedia variations, motivational/reflection videos, VCT Lists, and Quizzes; iii) the results of the validation indicate that most of the components of contents, presentation, multimedia principles, and the initial product of the model are considered fairly good. Most students very positively perceived the use of interactive multimedia in Civic Education learning for character development.

AB  - Popular discourse identifies education as the cure for many of society's ills. However, surviving university is often seen as a period in which students face a unique array of challenges. Many students begin their tertiary education as holistically-well individuals, but due to the stressors related to University, students often show incremental signs of psychological, physical and emotional distress. These often lead to a decrease in academic competence and severe professional ramifications. The aim of this study was to identify design principles and explore the perceptions of professionals concerning possible implementation strategies that could be suitable for Higher Educational Institutions, particularly Health Science and Medical School students. A qualitative, three-phase multi approach design was used in this study. Phase one was conducted by means of an explorative desktop literature review, there after phase 2 included a self-management, self-coaching and appreciative coaching concept map, that was aligned to concepts within the current individual wellness literature and in phase 3, Appreciative Inquiry based focus group discussions were held with various professional in the field of coaching, education, and healthcare. Wellness programmes are impacted by the fact that Higher Education Institutions face unique challenges such as time, financial constraints, and an already overloaded curriculum. Five design principles were described, and various implementation strategies explored. There is a fundamental necessity to address the distortion of wellness within HE. A key finding in this study suggests that combining self-coaching, appreciative coaching and self-management principles could facilitate a successful individual wellness programme for higher educational students.

AB  - Developing systems thinking skills in school can provide useful tools to deal with a vast amount of medical and health information that may help learners in decision making in their future lives as citizen. Thus, there is a need to develop effective tools that will allow learners to analyze biological systems and organize their knowledge. Here, we examine junior high school students' systems thinking skills in the context of the human circulatory system. A model was formulated for developing teaching and learning materials and for characterizing students' systems thinking skills. Specifically, we asked whether seventh grade students, who studied about the human circulatory system, acquired systems thinking skills, and what are the characteristics of those skills? Concept maps were used to characterize students' systems thinking components and examine possible changes in the students' knowledge structure. These maps were composed by the students before and following the learning process. The study findings indicate a significant improvement in the students' ability to recognize the system components and the processes that occur within the system, as well as the relationships between different levels of organization of the system, following the learning process. Thus, following learning students were able to organize the systems' components and its processes within a framework of relationships, namely the students' systems thinking skills were improved in the course of learning using the teaching and learning materials.

AB  - Background: The HealthMap project is developing an intervention to reduce cardiovascular risk in people living with HIV. As part of the formative stages of the intervention design, we sought to understand the needs of people with HIV (PWHIV). Methods: Two concept-mapping workshops with PWHIV (n = 10), and one with HIV care providers (n = 6) were conducted. The workshop findings were consolidated into a questionnaire administered to PWHIV (n = 300) and HIV care providers (n = 107). Participants were asked to rate the importance of each of 81 presented needs and the degree to which it was currently being met. Results: Workshops provided insights into what PWHIV perceive they need, to live with and manage their condition, and its impact on their life; these included: (1) clinical science research and development; (2) information and support; (3) personal situation; (4) healthcare quality; (5) access to services; (6) access to services specific to ageing; and (7) social justice. Questionnaire results revealed that PWHIV considered information and support, and research and development most important. For providers, healthcare quality, clients' personal situation, and social justice were most important. In terms of unmet needs, PWHIV and providers both highlighted issues in the areas of social justice, and access to aged care services. Conclusions: PWHIV and HIV providers continue to report unmet needs in the areas of social justice and emerging concerns about access to aged care services. Services must continue to address these issues of access and equity.

AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student-student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students' interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (R-2 = .05) and supportive interactions (R-2 = .16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (R-2 = .07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (R-2 = .07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (R-2 = .28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level.

AB  - The use of primary literature can be an effective way to expose students to the scientific research process. At the same time, primary literature can be intimidating to many students, particularly those with limited exposure to science research. The CREATE (consider, read, elucidate hypotheses, analyze and interpret the data, and think of the next experiment) method is an evidence-based teaching strategy that uses a structured series of pedagogical tools to allow students to perform intensive analysis of primary literature. The use of CREATE in biology classes increased student self-rated attitudes, confidence, and understanding of science. On the basis of these prior reports, we implemented CREATE in a one-semester, stand-alone, undergraduate chemistry course in which students analyzed a linked series of primary literature articles tracking the trajectory of a specific area of chemistry research. The course was aimed at second-year students, and our goals were to increase student confidence in engaging scientific literature, demystify the scientific process, and help students see themselves as having a role in that process. Pre- and post-course surveys indicated significant increases in understanding of the scientific process, along with gains in self-rated skills and attitudes related to science. Students also demonstrated gains in course content knowledge as assessed by a pre- and post-course concept mapping exercise. Thus, the CREATE method has been implemented in a chemistry teaching context that resulted in increased student knowledge.

AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop a laboratory activity based on 5E learning model enriched with different conceptual change methods such as computer animations, analogy, concept mapping, worksheet and hands-on activities for eliminating prospective science teachers' (PSTs) alternative conceptions on factors affecting the reaction rate and improving their scientific process skills (SPS). A group of experts was asked to comment on the laboratory activity. Some changes were made based on the comments of experts on the activity. The pilot study of the laboratory activity was carried out with 48 third year PSTs enrolled in 'Science Laboratory' course at the Faculty of Education, Giresun University, Turkey. In this paper, all phases of the activity are introduced in detailed. Also, the applicability of activity was investigated in a pilot study, based on observation by an independent researcher. In-class observations showed that the activity is performed two hours and it is effective to improve the students' motivation and enables them to be active during the learning process. As a result, the laboratory activity can be used as an alternative to activities in the literature. To investigate this and other similar activities' applicability in a comparative manner, further research should be undertaken. In addition, the effect of the laboratory activity based on 5E learning model combining different conceptual change methods should be examined if it helps the PSTs overcome their alternative conceptions and improve their SPS.

AB  - Semantic web technologies are not focus intrinsically to the terms describing a scientific field but extend further towards meaningful relationships, a task that in traditional systems of knowledge representation is allocated to humans. In a standard approach the most valuable tool in the study and comprehension of a scientific disciple is the concept map. This map is a well-structured and classifiable graph that represents scientific information optically. Evolution of this representation in the knowledge organization systems are the Topic Maps. In Topic Maps the different concepts are hierarchical and relational connected in a virtual map, while URIs ensure the interoperability of this form of ontology. Topic Maps allow to the developer a high degree of expressiveness, especially in the case of multidimensional relationships. Herein, we generated a Topic Map for the Cardiology field, using a minimum but sufficient set of terms to cover almost 70% of cardiovascular terminology. Cardiology is in focus because the cardiological disorders remain the first cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, while the available semantic description systems for this field are limited. We build an experimental cardiological ontology by utilizing XAMPP, Topincs, Wandora and Ontopia as developmental tools. The resulting map is currently under evaluation and enrichment to include in addition to the clinical entities, cell biology, implantable instruments, and pharmaceuticals. We anticipate that in future this tool would be a valuable addition in information science and cardiology which will assist both clinical and experimental scientists.

AB  - This 2-group quasi-experimental study was conducted to explore the following research questions: Do the fourth graders' post-intervention scores achieved in the unit of force and motion achievement test and attitude scale toward the unit depend on being in the groups that were taught the unit either with 'Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material' (ONACOM) integrated PBL and with ONACOM-integrated EL when we control for their respective pretest scores and their science grades in the previous semester? What are the students' gains, achievement, attitude and retention from the two systematic applications of the ONACOM-integrated methods, PBL and EL? The sample (N=220) consisted of fourth graders at public elementary schools in Burdur, Turkey. Although there were no significant treatment effects favoring one of the methods, teaching science topics by integrating ONACOM consistently in both methods increased the students' achievement and attitude levels and supported their knowledge retention with large effect sizes significantly. As well-developed innovative software, ONACOM is effective on learning regardless of the course and method when it is systematically integrated into teaching methods, since it is prepared on the basis of multimedia learning strategies and is suitable for the essential structures of both teaching methods.

AB  - Background: Bearing in mind the philosophical pedagogical significance of short phrases for the training of researchers in the health care ambit, we hence have studied the aphorisms and striking phrases expressed during the epidemiology course at the Andalusian School of Public Health.
   Methods: Belonging to the qualitative type and applied through the establishment of a multidisciplinary focus group made up of ten post-graduated students, where one of them acted as a moderator. The collection of information lasted four months. Information was classified in two ways: Firstly, aphorisms and short phrases with a pedagogical impact; and secondly, data with statistical, epidemiological, epistemological, pragmatic, or heuristic component, and for scientific diffusion. It was decided to perform a triangulation that included a descriptive presentation and a basic categorical analysis. The two teachers with a highest interpretative load have been identified.
   Results: A total of 127 elements, regarded as of interest by the focus group, were collected. Forty-four of them (34.6%) were aphorisms, and 83 were short phrases with a pedagogical load (65.3%). Most of all them were classified as statistical elements (35.4%) followed by epistemological (21.3%) and epidemiological (15.7%) elements. There was no tendency towards aphorisms or short phrases (P > 0.05) among the teachers with more informative representation.
   Conclusion: There has been a tilt in the contents towards the statistical area to the detriment of the epidemiological one. Concept maps have visualized classifications. This sort of qualitative analysis helps the researcher review contents acquired during his/her training process.

AB  - Purpose of Study: The aim of this study is to investigate the nature of pre-service biology teachers' metaconceptual processes that were active as they participated in metaconceptual teaching activities. Methods: Several instructional activities, including poster drawing, concept mapping, group and class discussions, and journal writing, were carried out to activate the metaconceptual processes of 32 second-grade, pre-service biology teachers in order to change their alternative conceptions regarding seed plants. Case study was used as a research method. Among the 32 participants, five participants who activated five participants who activated rich and diverse metaconceptual processes and who reflected well and clearly on their mental processes in their journals were selected for the case study. The journal entries written by these five students before, during, and after the teaching activities were used as a data source. Content analysis was used to code the journals of the pre-service teachers according to the types and the content of metaconceptual processes. Results and Conclusions: The results indicated that students engaged in several types of metaconceptual activities, which can be classified under metaconceptual awareness, metaconceptual monitoring, and metaconceptual evaluation. Metaconceptual processes were activated interdependently in different forms, ranging from simpler first-order metaconceptual awareness to more sophisticated metaconceptual evaluations. Recommendations: In designing metaconceptual teaching activities, teachers should take the interdependent and multifaceted nature of these processes into consideration. (C) 2017 Ani Publishing Ltd.

AB  - Education is critical for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 concentration, but collaboration between countries is also critical. It is a global problem in which we cannot isolate ourselves. Our students must learn to collaborate in seeking solutions together with others from other countries. Thus, the research question of this study is whether interactive cross-border science classes with energy experiments are feasible and can increase awareness of energy efficiency among middle school students. We designed and tested an interactive cross-border class between Chilean and Peruvian eighth-grade classes. The classes were synchronously connected and all students did experiments and answered open-ended questions on an online platform. Some of the questions were designed to check conceptual understanding whereas others asked for suggestions of how to develop their economies while keeping CO2 air concentration at acceptable levels. In real time, the teacher reviewed the students' written answers and the concept maps that were automatically generated based on their responses. Students peer-reviewed their classmates' suggestions. This is part of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education project on energy efficiency using APEC databases. We found high levels of student engagement, where students discussed not only the cross-cutting nature of energy, but also its relation to socioeconomic development and CO2 emissions, and the need to work together to improve energy efficiency. In conclusion, interactive cross-border science classes are a feasible educational alternative, with potential as a scalable public policy strategy for improving awareness of energy efficiency among the population.

AB  - Purpose
   To conduct a scoping review to explore the construct of shared mental models (SMMs) in the context of clinical teamwork among health professions learners.
   Method
   The authors searched the PubMed, ERIC, CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, PsychINFO, and EMBASE databases for English-language articles published between 2000 and 2016. Eligible articles mentioned SMMs in relation to clinical teamwork and included health professions learners. Two reviewers screened studies for eligibility and extracted data to determine the depth and breadth of the literature on SMMs. The authors examined definitions of the SMM construct in the context of clinical teams, educational interventions using SMMs, and the measurement of SMMs.
   Results
   Of the 1,273 articles retrieved, 23 met the inclusion criteria. SMMs were defined in less than two-fifths of the articles (9/23). All articles applied the construct to improvements in hospital-based patient safety, often in high-intensity settings (14/23). Most articles included graduate-level physicians (21/23) within clinical teams (18/23). Interventions designed to foster SMMs (6/23) included teamwork curricula/training and teamwork supportive tools. Measurements of SMMs (7/23) included a qualitative task analysis, quantitative analyses of speech, a concept mapping, and Likert-type surveys.
   Conclusions
   In health professions education, the SMM construct lacks clear definition. Few studies described educational interventions aimed at SMM development, and few attempted to measure the construct. The authors propose an operational definition of SMMs in health care and illustrate how interventions intended to foster SMMs, such as team trainings or planning exercises and communication tools, could be developed, implemented, and assessed.

AB  - Background and ObjectiveQualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews and focus-groups are used to evaluate the applicability and relevance of device technologies in clinical practice, but when used alone, often lack generalizability. This study aimed to assess the face validity and feasibility of using a composite, three-step qualitative method (the Parker Model), to inform the development and implementation of ava((R)), an electromechanical device (e-Device) for subcutaneous self-administration of the biologic, certolizumab pegol (CZP), used to treat rheumatic diseases.MethodsThe Parker Model combines concept mapping (CM), participatory design (PD), and stakeholder evaluation (SE). CM, a structured group process, was used to identify patients' opinions and concerns regarding the e-Device. Patients used this information in iterative PD sessions to create personal e-Device prototypes in cooperation with a designer and a healthcare professional. SE was performed based on semi-structured group and individual interviews with patients and disease-management stakeholders.ResultsThe study recruited 14 patients, two doctors, two nurses, one medical secretary, and four other public servants. Three CM workshops revealed four key considerations: technical usability, physical design, concerns, and enthusiasm. Four personalized prototypes were developed during PD sessions. SE confirmed that the identified considerations were pivotal for the implementation and adaptation of the e-Device.ConclusionsThis study is the first to apply a composite, qualitative research model when introducing an e-Device for the treatment and management of rheumatic disease. Results show that input from patients and other stakeholders using the Parker Model can add value to the development and implementation of an e-Device.

AB  - Research has established that students enter their science classes with ideas about the natural world that do not align with accepted scientific beliefs. The diagnosis of these student preconceptions may be seen as an initial, crucial step in the process of teacher-facilitated conceptual change. So as to capture what science teachers do in their everyday classroom routines to diagnose these student preconceptions, in-depth observations and interviews were conducted with four exemplary secondary science teachers. The teachers' strategies for diagnosing students' preconceptions, their use of information found through diagnosis, and the teachers' understanding of students' preinstructional ideas were all analyzed. The four teachers in this study did not use any formal assessment tools such as pretests, concept maps, interviews, or journal writing to diagnose students' ideas, although they all stated that finding out what students know prior to instruction is important. The teachers all declared that they used questioning to gather information on student ideas but were seen in their classes to rely heavily on low-level, recall questions. One of the teachers, the most experienced, did conduct class discussions where the students were encouraged to express their ideas and preconceptions. The four teachers' understanding of what student preconceptions consist of and the justification for attempting to diagnose these ideas was seen to be weak. The implications of these findings and recommendations for teacher training are made in the article. (C) 2003 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

AB  - Understanding abstract models in automata theory is important in the fields of computer science and digital circuit design. In automata theory, problems are categorized in different classes of computability, from simpler to harder. Problems which lie in class of regular languages are simplest kind of problems. Problems which lie in class of context-free languages are relatively harder. Students tend to confuse the relationship between these two classes of languages and between their members. Questions related to the closure properties of regular and/or context free languages pose particular problems. Students make mistakes performing operations like intersection, union and concatenation on sets of regular and context-free languages. For this research the students of automata are asked to solve some examination and assignment problems related to closure properties of the above said classes. A questionnaire, seeking descriptive answers, is used to study 1) the mental process 2) the structure of mental concept map and 3) line of reasoning followed while attempting a problem. This study reveals that the students make mistakes because their abstract concepts are not correctly structured and in particular do not support logical inferences. Students also have a tendency to apply the concepts mechanically instead of applying them meaningfully. Finally, students fail to actuate proper conceptual link at proper time.

AB  - When discussing the topic "Hunger in Africa" with students, incorrect and biased ideas on the causes for hunger are revealed. In order to change the students' personal concepts it is necessary to become acquainted with their mental models. Therefore, a survey of Geography students' different personal theories concerning "Hunger in Africa" was carried out. By means of interviews followed by concept mapping, the various personal theories were identified. It became apparent that the students mostly rely on climate and the population growth as arguments to explain the occurrence of hunger in Africa. The greatest difference between the personal and the scientific theories was that the students included almost no external influences, whether economic or political, in their explanations but relied mostly on factors within a country when formulating their statements. The research literature commonly suggests that there are three steps in reshaping learners' "misconceptions". The first is to make the present views explicitly the subject of the discussion. At this point the experiences that led to these views should be reflected on and newly interpreted. Second, the newly acquired knowledge must prove itself when used in certain contexts. Finally, during the process, a cooperative culture of learning must prevail, where the learner is convinced that he can control his own acquisition of knowledge. On the basis of these insights, teaching aids were developed that allow students to check their own personal concepts, to dismiss them and to align them with scientific concepts.

AB  - Groups of children at a science museum were pre- and post-assessed with a type of concept map, known as personal meaning maps, to determine what new understandings, if any, they were gaining from participation in a series of structured hands-on activities about bones and the process of bones healing. Close examination was made regarding whether children's prior knowledge or a ceiling effect was influencing results. Children made significant gains in vocabulary and concepts related to both bones and the bone healing process. Many children also demonstrated that their comprehension moved from a novice level to a transitional level of understanding. Prior to participation, children were more uniformly unacquainted with ideas about the healing process of bones than they were about bones; this led to more consistent learning gains related to the healing process. There was some indication of a ceiling effect occurring when children revealed what they had learned about bones, but not when they revealed what they had learned about the bone healing process. Although the prior knowledge theory was not statistically supported, data did show that children with greater understanding prior to the Busy Bones Lab activities end up with correspondingly greater understanding. This suggests that addressing concepts related to bones prior to a lab experience may bring more children to a higher level of understanding before engaging in the lab experience.

AB  - Learning is gaining attention in relation to governance processes for contemporary environmental challenges; however, scholarship at the nexus of learning and environmental governance lacks clarity and understanding about how to define and measure learning, and the linkages between learning, social interactions, and environment. In response, this study aimed to advance and operationalize a typology of learning in an environmental governance context, and examined if a participatory decision-making process (adaptive co-management) for climate change adaptation fostered learning. Three types of learning were identified: cognitive learning, related to the acquisition of new or the structuring of existing knowledge; normative learning, which concerns a shift in viewpoints, values or paradigms, and relational learning, referring to an improved understanding of others' mindsets, enhanced trust and ability to cooperate. A robust mixed methods approach with a focus on quantitative measures including concept map analysis, social network analysis, and self-reflective questions, was designed to gauge indicators for each learning type. A participatory decision-making process for climate change adaptation was initiated with stakeholders in the Niagara region, Canada. A pseudo-control group was used to minimize external contextual influences on results. Clear empirical evidence of cognitive and relational learning was gained; however, the results from normative learning measures were inconclusive. The learning typology and measurement method operationalized in this research advances previous treatments of learning in relation to participatory decision-making processes, and supports adaptive co-management as a governance strategy that fosters learning and adaptive capacity.

AB  - This study sought to determine the levels of conceptual understanding of undergraduate students regarding organic compounds within different functional groups. A total of 60 students who were enrolled in the Department of Secondary Science and Mathematics Education of a Faculty of Education at a state university in Turkey and who had followed an Organic Chemistry Laboratory Course participated in the study. The data were collected using two tools: functional group worksheets and concept maps. Both qualitative and quantitative evaluations were used in analyzing the data. The findings showed that the students generally had low levels of understanding of concepts relating to functional groups, and they exhibited a considerable number of misconceptions. Considering the findings more fully, it was determined that students have remarkable misconceptions and low levels of understanding about certain topics regarding functional groups, including the physical properties of functional groups, intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, reduction and oxidation, stereoisomerism and structural isomerism, and aromaticity and aliphaticity, as well as other organic chemistry concepts (e.g. decarboxylation, oxyacide, and phenol). The results suggest that since students are unable to adequately comprehend the subjects of general chemistry, such as intramolecular and intermolecular bonds, acidity and basicity, oxidation and reduction and determination of molecular structures, they fail to accurately transfer their knowledge to learning about organic chemistry. In order to promote students' understanding of functional groups and prevent related misconceptions, it is recommended that basic chemistry topics should be reinforced, and the relationship between students' current knowledge and the new information to be learned in organic chemistry should be emphasized with the help of activities in which various forms of thinking are used.

TI  - Organizational Models of Educational Technology in US and Canadian Medical Schools
T2  - ACADEMIC MEDICINE
AB  - Purpose
   To examine the organizational structure of educational technology units within U.S. and Canadian medical schools in orcer to (1) identify organization models that support educational technology, (2) describe key attributes of these models, and (3) discuss the strengths and challenges associated with these models.
   Method
   The authors distributed a survey to 88 schools that had previously provided information on their educational technology services and infrastructure. The authors developed the survey through a series of pilots and, then, from thE data for each respondent school, created concept maps, which were used to identify organizational models. The authors conducted analyses to determine differences among models. The authors coded the comments about organizational models and identified themes.
   Results
   The authors received adequate data for analysis from 61 schools (69%). Four models for educational technology organizations emerged: (1) centralized units located in the school of medicine, (2) centralized units located at the health science center, (3) centralized units at the comprehensive university, and (4) no centralized unit (Dispersed Model). The majority (75%) of schools relied on some type of centralized organization. Whereas few organization attributes proved to be statistically significant, the centralized models have more resources devoted to educational technology and a closer alignment with the academic mission than the Dispersed Model.
   Conclusions
   Medical schools primarily use central models. The authors recommend that schools structuring their educational technology resources consider exploration of a central model because of its focused use of resources to improve teaching and learning.

AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the extant literature of knowledge sharing (KS) and knowledge transfer (KT) in the small and medium enterprise (SME) context and to contribute with predictions of emerging themes.
   Design/methodology/approach - Applied is a systematic literature review using three bibliometric techniques: (1) textual analysis for keywords and abstracts to identify the research hotspots, (2) co-citation analysis of references to identify the evolution of KS and KT in SME and (3) bibliographic coupling analysis of documents to synthesize antecedents and outcomes.
   Findings - A conceptual map emerges from the review to reveal the antecedents of KS and KT at the individual, group and organizational levels. The analysis shows the strategic importance of KS and KT for the SME context. Specific findings include: (1) KS and KT are involved in enhancing SMEs strategic focus for human resources, including organizational learning, customer relations, creativity, higher profit and positive effects on operational processes and decision-making. (2) Innovation, trust and performance are identified as central human factors linked to KS and KT in SMEs. (3) Human resource (HR) management research could contribute to KS and KT in the SME domain by exploring KS- and KT-based practices, linking the emergence of innovation and innovative behaviors to these practices, leading to a better understanding of strategies that enable the long-term storage and retrieval of tacit and explicit knowledge as organizational memory in the SME context.
   Originality/value - This paper is one of the first to systematically review KS and KT in SMEs and propose a concept map. The research adds value to the growing literature of KS and KT and exposes the need for more specific activities to support SME managers, as well as HR managers, who need to facilitate KS and KT in SMEs.

AB  - Background
   Most teacher development initiatives focus on enhancing knowledge of teaching (pedagogy), whilst largely ignoring other important features of teacher knowledge such as subject matter knowledge and awareness of the learning context. Furthermore, teachers' ability to learn from faculty development interventions is limited by their existing (often implicit) pedagogical knowledge and beliefs. Pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) represents a model of teacher knowledge incorporating what they know about subject matter, pedagogy and context. PCK can be used to explore teachers' prior knowledge and to structure faculty development programmes so that they take account of a broader range of teachers' knowledge. We set out to examine the application of a PCK model in a general practice education setting.
   Methods
   This study is part of a larger study that employed a mixed method approach (concept mapping, phenomenological interviews and video-stimulated recall) to explore features of GP teachers' subject matter knowledge, pedagogical knowledge and knowledge of the learning environment in the context of a general practice tutorial.
   Results
   This paper presents data on GP teachers' pedagogical and context knowledge. There was considerable overlap between different GP teachers' knowledge and beliefs about learners and the clinical learning environment (i.e. knowledge of context). The teachers' beliefs about learners were largely based on assumptions derived from their own student experiences. There were stark differences, however, between teachers in terms of pedagogical knowledge, particularly in terms of their teaching orientations (i.e. transmission or facilitation orientation) and this was manifest in their teaching behaviours.
   Conclusions
   PCK represents a useful model for conceptualising clinical teacher prior knowledge in three domains, namely subject matter, learning context and pedagogy. It can and should be used as a simple guiding framework by faculty developers to inform the design and delivery of their faculty development programmes.

AB  - Preserving important troubleshooting experience gained in industrial practice, often referred to as "tribal knowledge", and making it readily available to be re-applied in similar situations represent a serious challenge for many companies in heavy industry. The solution is very often tied to building mental models to capture and express key latent cognitive variables. In this paper, we first attempt to identify the appropriate knowledge based system diagnosis paradigms. A conceptual map-based framework is then proposed as a potential solution for retaining tribal knowledge. The validity and feasibility of the approach are demonstrated through a training program developed under the support of National Science Foundation (NSF) for improving engineering and technology students' troubleshooting skills.

AB  - The flow of materials and energy through society is an integral but poorly visible element of global sustainability agendas such as the Planetary Boundaries Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). Given that the primary activities of chemistry are to analyze, synthesize, and transform matter, the practice of chemistry has a great deal to contribute to sustainability science, which in turn should play an increasingly important role in reshaping the practice of chemistry. Success in integrating sustainability considerations into the practice of chemistry implies a substantial role for chemistry education to better equip students to address the sustainability of earth and societal systems. Building on the framework of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project, we develop approaches to using systems thinking to educate students about the molecular basis of sustainability, to assist chemistry to contribute meaningfully and visibly toward the attainment of global sustainability agendas. A detailed exemplar shows how ubiquitous coverage in general chemistry courses of the Haber-Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia could be extended using systems thinking to consider the complex interplay of this industrial process with scientific, societal, and environmental systems. Systems thinking tools such as systems thinking concept map extension (SOCME) visualizations assist in highlighting inputs, outputs, and societal consequences of this large-scale industrial process, including both intended and unintended alterations to the planetary cycle of nitrogenous compounds. Strategies for using systems thinking in chemistry education and addressing the challenges its use may bring to educators and students are discussed, and suggestions are offered for general chemistry instructors using systems thinking to educate about the molecular basis of sustainability.

AB  - The implementation of systems approaches and systems thinking has been considered as an important parameter for reforming chemistry education and practice. The "Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL)" strategy is a teaching-learning approach which is based on the development and use of cyclic concept mapping procedures, known as systemics, for teaching as well as for students' assessment, known as SAQs. The SATL strategy focuses on the enhancement of students' systems thinking skills, which are believed to enhance their understanding of relevant science concepts. The aims of this study were: (a) To investigate the effect of the implementation of the SATL strategy on 11th grade students' deep understanding of chemistry concepts, and (b) to explore the relationship between students' understanding in chemistry and the development of basic systems thinking skills. For this purpose, an experimental group, taught by the SATL strategy, was compared with a control group taught by a traditional linear approach, regarding students' chemistry understanding. For the intervention group, the relationship between students' understanding and their systems thinking skills was also explored. The results indicated that chemistry understanding of students taught by the SATL strategy was significantly greater compared to that of students taught by a traditional linear approach. Moreover, a significant correlation was observed between students' deep understanding of chemistry concepts and their systems thinking level. This research provides evidence for a possible relationship between chemistry deep understanding and the development of systems thinking skills.

AB  - This study investigated the effect of metaconceptual teaching interventions on students' understanding of force and motion concepts. A multimethod research design including quasi-experimental design and case study designs was employed to compare the effect of the metaconceptual activities and traditional instruction and investigate students' reactions to metaconceptual teaching interventions. The participants (45 high school students in the USA) were enrolled in one of the two physics classes instructed by the same science teacher. In the experimental group, students' engagement in metaconceptual knowledge and processes was facilitated through various instructional activities, including poster drawing, journal writing, group debate, concept mapping, and class and group discussions. These activities were intended to facilitate students' engagement in (a) becoming aware of their existing and past conceptions, associated beliefs, everyday experiences, and contextual differences, (b) monitoring their understanding of the new conception, the changes in ideas, and the consistency between existing and new conceptions, and (c) evaluating the relative ability of competing conceptions to explain a physical phenomenon. In the comparison group, the same content knowledge was explained by the teacher along with the use of laboratory experiments, demonstrations, and quantitative problem solving. Students' reactions to the designed instructional activities indicated that metaconceptual teaching interventions were successful in facilitating students' engagement in several types of metaconceptual functioning. The results showed that students in the experimental group had significantly better conceptual understanding than their counterparts in the comparison group and this positive impact remained after a period of 9 weeks.

AB  - MILA,Multiple interactive learning algorithms are an innovation in teaching and learning.Since conventional teaching methodology involves one way communication it prevents students from active participation. MILA is a methodology which involves active participation by the students in the form of activity and discussions. Activity based learning is an evolution in the teaching learning process to overcome the limitations from conventional teaching or learning.(Patil et al. 2016). Clarity in theoretical concepts is essential for application in reality. However this cannot be achieved by conventional teaching.(Rogers 2009) Transformation from conventional teaching to activity based learning has a positive influence on students.(Rogers 2009; Cummings and Sheeran 2019) By reinforcing concepts learned during lecture, visually teaching new concepts and providing an outlet where the students are free to interact more casually with the instructor and their peers enhances their concentration and confidence.(Kanchanamala and Muppidi 2016). Activity-based learning prescribes an array of methods of pedagogical approaches to teaching. Its core practice lies on hands-on experiments and activities.(Gibbes and Carson 2014).
   In our study we have tried numerous activities in teaching head and neck anatomy to dental undergraduate students. We have tried numerous individual and team activities in teaching anatomy. The activities include concept mapping, model making using chart, clay modelling, sketching, etc. A short flipped video followed by interaction with the facilitator and activity which enables students to have an active learning session. We found it to be a very effective learning methodology based on the students performance and the feedback we received from the students.

AB  - Effective learning is always an active process where students should create and construct their knowledge themselves. To support this independent work, creative strategies for elaborating, structuring, visualizing and memorizing learning contents are welcome in every domain. They are especially useful in subjects considered as difficult or for students with learning difficulties. Mind maps, concept maps and advanced organizers are familiar tools for visualization. Modeling is one of these creative learning strategies, with the benefit, that it is additionally fostering computational thinking and digital literacy. In this paper, we focus on modeling with diagrams used as learning strategy. These diagrams originally come from the field of computer science, where modeling is a crucial concept and visualizing technique. We mainly use diagrams of the Unified Modeling Language (UML), a graphic modeling language used in software engineering. With UML diagrams it is possible to cover respectively visualize a broad range of situations and learning purposes across all subjects from primary up to secondary education. Our research focuses on detecting those diagrams that are most useful and practicable for teachers and learners without computer science background. The paper introduces the use of modeling as brain-based learning strategy and describes which models and diagrams can be used for which purpose and in which context in order to support and enrich learning and teaching in different subjects. Besides giving some creative ideas and best practice examples for primary and lower secondary education, the paper summarizes qualitative results gained up to now, which build the basis for our new international project "Modeling at School". Finally, we give an outlook on this project, its research focus and some preliminary results.

AB  - The chief trend of Information Age is visualization of information blocks which provides timely control of information, its usage in scientific research, and in supervising complex objects, economy, etc. The main function of visualization is to provide information in the form which is visually and logically convenient for the user. With this purpose it is changed and improved on cognitive principles of presenting knowledge: structures are created, elements are connected and curtailed at marking elements and relationships. In other words it is compressed for better understanding the knowledge and using it. Visualization occupies a deserving place in education. It improves the quality of professional, scientific and training activities. The research is held both in our country and abroad, where due to works, such as "mental maps", "maps of the mind" and "concept maps" a high level of visual literacy in education and production activity is provided. Remarkably, that a corresponding organizing-information resource is founded: Journal of Visual literacy, International Visual Literacy Association, Artstor Digital Library. Various trends of visualization are worked out within the above mentioned trends; one of them is logical cognitive modeling of knowledge, presented on a natural language. The peculiarity of approach is search of nature comfortable (socio-cultural) basis of graphic coordinating basic foundation for logical-cognitive models which provide their image-notion character. The article deals with peculiarities of structure and didactic functions of logical-cognitive models and their usage in didactic design. (C) 2017 Published by Future Academy www.FutureAcademy.org.UK

AB  - Objective Physicians tend to focus on biomedical targets while little is known about issues important to patients. We aimed to identify critical concepts impacting patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
   Design We performed a survey of patients with IBD in biologic therapy (n=172) and used a validated qualitative method called group concept mapping (GCM) in patient workshops. The survey included 13 questions on attitudes toward symptoms and issues related to IBD. In the eight workshops, patients (n=26) generated statements later clustered into concepts identifying issues impacting a patient's life. Patients ranked the statements.
   Results In the survey, patients' mean age were 40 years (SD 13), 53% were women, and 38% had ulcerative colitis. They identified fatigue (57%) and stool frequency (46%) as the most critical symptoms impacting their daily lives regardless of disease activity. In the GCM workshops with Crohn's disease (n=13) (median age 42 years (IQR 39-51) and 62% were women), 335 statements divided among 10 concepts were generated, and the three most important concepts were 'Positive attitudes', 'Accept and recognition', and 'Sharing knowledge and experiences in life with Crohn's disease'. In the workshops with ulcerative colitis (n=13) (median age 43 years (IQR 36-49) and 69% were women), 408 statements divided into 11 concepts were generated; the most important concepts were 'Take responsibility and control over your life', 'Medication', and 'Everyday life with ulcerative colitis'.
   Conclusion Focusing solely on IBD symptoms, patients identified fatigue and stool frequency to impact daily life the most. However, when investigating the disease burden in a broader perspective beyond classic IBD symptoms, patients identified concepts with focus on emotional health to be most important.

AB  - Science educators highlight the importance of developing systems thinking (ST) and futures thinking (FT) for students to make decisions and to be active citizens that address socioscientific problems. The dimensions related to FT take in this study were three implied in ST and two in the appropriation of the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the level of FT-related dimensions developed by a group of pre-service elementary teachers and how far different activities designed to foster them were effective. Written explanations presented by the participants about the origin of pandemics and possible ways to prevent them, as well as videos developed by small groups with the goal to present a campaign for avoiding future pandemics, were analysed. Based on the literature, five dimensions and up to four levels of performances were identified. After completing the activities, participants were able to relate the three spheres of the "One Health" notion to explain the causes of pandemics. Moreover, they established complex cause-effect relationships between the different factors, although they only constructed monocausal relationships when proposing measures. Participants improved their performance in anticipating the future and identifying themselves as agents of change. The elaboration of concept maps facilitated the development of components and behaviour ST dimensions, and the design of the campaign allowed participants to identify themselves as agents of change. The use of these strategies in science education can contribute to the development of a citizenry capable of understanding and acting on systems.

T2  - TRAINING & DEVELOPMENT
AB  - According to Eric Jensen, author of Teaching With the Brain in Mind, "Learning and memory are two sides of a coin. You can't talk about one without the other." Weiss tells us that learning is the making of memory: When we learn and remember, we create chemical changes at the neuron level.
   When we learn something that stays with us for any length of time, it transfers from our short- to our long-term memory. In that process, the connections between neurons become more complex. The more often we access those memories, the stronger the connections become and the better we remember.
   According to educator Jeb Schenck, "teaching directs the making of memory." He stresses the importance of awareness-how a person is learning, where the memory is being stored, and how to find it.
   Instructors can help students remember by matching methods of teaching and assessment. For example, when teaching something visual, assessment would ask for visual recall. In that way, Schenck says, "You're teaching the student how to find the memory."
   Schenk outlines several other techniques instructors can use for better recall:
   Ask participants to pay attention to when they get tired or lose focus. Allow them to take a 15- or 20-minute break by changing tasks or doing some physical activity.
   Teach concept maps that illustrate the relationships between ideas.
   Use multiple forms of review-written, visual, and kinesthetic.
   Teach multiple names and descriptions for concepts so that the brain can cross-index memory files.
   Replicate the physical test environment during learning, so that learners get external retrieval cues.
   Practice past perfection to make sure concepts are ingrained in people's longterm memory.

TI  - Teaching and Coherent Science: An Investigation of Teachers' Beliefs About and Practice of Teaching Science Coherently
T2  - SCHOOL SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS
AB  - This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers' beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many classroom teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers' thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers' beliefs, stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool may have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers' stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards' vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could be characterized in three ways; coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs about the connections of concepts within science.

AB  - Objective: To design, implement, and evaluate a molecular imaging elective course that would expose Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) students to fundamentals of various imaging modalities and their pre-clinical and clinical applications.
   Methods: The "Surveys of Multi-Modality Imaging" course is a two-credit hour elective course offered to third-year PharmD and doctoral students. Experiential learning methods including active learning application-based exercises were used to supplement didactic lectures in the form of field trips (with follow-up debriefings), small group team-based tasks, hands-on demonstrations, visual modelling, gamification with problem sets, concept maps regarding given modalities, and concluding with written summary reports and formal in-class group presentations. In addition to standard course evaluations, a pre- and post-course survey were conducted to assess the students' confidence regarding course content.
   Results: Since its implementation in 2013, 101 students have completed the course with 72% being PharmD students (n = 73) and the remainder being doctoral students in pharmaceutical science (n = 28). Pre- and post-assessments completed by the students the last two offerings (n = 40 of a possible 43) indicated a shift in students' self-reported confidence in discussing imaging modalities from a total of 2.4% confidence (pre-course) to 97.4% confidence (postcourse). Also, post-course survey indicated that 77.5% (n = 31 of 40 participants) students strongly agreed that our immersive and experiential learning activities were beneficial to overall learning for this elective.
   Conclusion: Students who participated in this innovative experiential learning-grounded course gained an appreciation for molecular imaging and its value and role in modern drug therapy.

AB  - Several abstract concepts in medical education are difficult to teach and comprehend. In order to address this challenge, we have been applying the approach of reification of abstract concepts using interactive virtual environments and a knowledge-based design. Reification is the process of making abstract concepts and events, beyond the realm of direct human experience, concrete and accessible to teachers and learners. Entering virtual worlds and simulations not otherwise easily accessible provides an opportunity to create, study, and evaluate the emergence of knowledge and comprehension from the direct interaction of learners with otherwise complex abstract ideas and principles by bringing them to life. Using a knowledge-based design process and appropriate subject matter experts, knowledge structure methods are applied in order to prioritize, characterize important relationships, and create a concept map that can be integrated into the reified models that are subsequently developed. Applying these principles, our interdisciplinary team has been developing a reified model of the nephron into which important physiologic functions can be integrated and rendered into a three dimensional virtual environment called Flatland, a virtual environments development software tool, within which a learners can interact using off-the-shelf hardware. The nephron model can be driven dynamically by a rules-based artificial intelligence engine, applying the rules and concepts developed in conjunction with the subject matter experts. In the future, the nephron model can be used to interactively demonstrate a number of physiologic principles or a variety of pathological processes that may be difficult to teach and understand. In addition, this approach to reification can be applied to a host of other physiologic and pathological concepts in other systems. These methods will require further evaluation to determine their impact and role in learning.

T2  - INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION

AB  - The quantitative Knowledge Space Theory is applied here for the first time to specific science concepts in order to evaluate its feasibility as a general assessment method for science learning. In particular, the knowledge states of students in the 4th through 12th grades are suggested for three science concepts before and after classroom teaching/learning experiences. The theory belongs to the vast category of latent trait models based upon the Rasch model, but differs in ail its most important characteristics by hating the power to extract the cognitive organization of the material. Student responses to the pre-tests and the post-tests were analyzed for the pressure concept, the density concept and the conservation of matter, and tentative critical learning pathways for each concept are suggested which describe the most probable sequences of learning steps. In all three cases the quantitative results show a change in the students' logic structure after the classroom experience. Knowledge Space Theory shows considerable promise for providing a useful quantitative analysis technique for assessing and analyzing the knowledge of students when used with other assessment methods such as concept mapping and clinical interviews. Ultimately, exemplary strategies and materials may be identified by this procedure for helping teachers effectively move students along the most probable critical learning pathways as suggested by the students themselves.

KW  - textbook
KW  - migration
AB  - Curriculums of education system and textbooks which are prepared in accordance with curriculum philosophy reflect the viewpoint of government about related subject during teaching of a phenomenon. In other words, phenomena in the curriculum and the textbook of a lesson can be thought as a projection of governments, what the governments want their citizens to know about this phenomenon. In this context, it is going to be a beneficial approach to research curriculums and textbooks when an answer is searched for any questions as to teaching of a phenomenon. When curriculums of secondary education and textbooks are analyzed about teaching of the phenomenon of migration, it is seen that this fact is more strongly associated with science of geography as it occurs at a place, has environmental effects and it is about population. Therefore, in this study it is aimed to research how the phenomenon of migration is addressed in textbooks which are prepared based on geography lesson curriculum. Document analysis was used in data collection process of this study based on descriptive research. Data were analyzed by regarding migration concept map prepared by researchers as a criterion. The results of the study revealed that aspect of learning outcome of geography lesson curriculum and aspect of content of textbooks are insufficient as to teaching of the phenomenon of migration. Solutions intended curriculum and the content of textbook of geography lesson have been proposed to be able to provide the teaching of the phenomenon of migration with all aspects.

KW  - horizontal integrations
KW  - FACULTY
AB  - The objective of this study was to analyze the results of a survey on students regarding the integration of their institution's health science curriculum.
   Methods: One hundred and twenty five (125) students of the 5th term of the undergraduate medical course were given a questionnaire on the integration sessions. The questionnaire with a five point Likert scale, with a minimum of one and a maximum of five rating, was administered in October 2009. The data from the questionnaire was compiled and analyzed by using the SPSS version 16.
   Results: One hundred and twenty two students out of the one hundred and twenty five answered the questionnaire 122/ 125 (97.6%). The reliability of the scale was 0.50 (Cronbachs alpha -0.5). 91.8% students agreed that integrated teaching helped in the appreciation and application of the basic science knowledge to health and disease. 82% agreed that integrated teaching improved the performance in clinics and university examinations. The responses were equally distributed in favour of traditional teaching (36%) and integrated teaching (30.3%), while 33.6% responses were of indecisisive. 51.7% of the students preferred the horizontal to vertical integrated teaching.
   Many positive aspects were listed by the students, such as "integrated teaching improves the understanding of the topics" and a few negative remarks such as "lengthy" were mentioned. The students suggested mind mapping, concept maps and small group discussions to improve the interaction.
   Conclusion: The students recognized that integrating the medical subjects was useful and of interest to them, and that they should be continued.

KW  - PHYSICS
AB  - This study aims at developing an electronic portfolio-based assessment strategy as valid and reliable assessment for learning on colloidal system material to measure student concept mastery. This study used a Design-Based Research (DBR) with a 4D development model that is carried out until stage 3 (Define. Design, and Development). The participant in this study were 10 students of class XI in one of High Schools in Bandung who were involved in the limited trial phase. The concept mastery ability measured in this study used the Revised Bloom's Taxonomy framework. However, the researcher only used the cognitive level of applying (C3) and analyzing (C4) based on the analysis of Core Competence and Basic Competence in the syllabus for colloidal system material. The tasks developed in this electronic portfolio assessment consist of three tasks, namely a concept map of the types of colloids; papers on the properties of colloids, the application of the properties of colloids in life, and how to make colloids; and a practical simulation report on the colloidal properties of the Tyndall effect. The results show ed that the instrument was valid with a CVR value of 0.6 - 1.0 and reliable with a Cronbach Alpha value of 0.679 - 1.000. Based on the results of a limited trial of the developed electronic portfolio-based assessment strategy, it can measure student concept mastery on colloidal system material. Overall, the average level of student concept mastery is categorized as good. With details in the category of very good (30%), good (50%) and sufficient (20%).

AB  - This study examined variation in the organization of domain-specific knowledge by 50 Year-12 chemistry students and 4 chemistry teachers. The study used nonmetric multidimensional scaling (MDS) and the Pathfinder network-generating algorithm to investigate individual and group differences in student concepts maps about chemical equilibrium. MDS was used to represent the individual maps in two-dimensional space, based on the presence or absence of paired propositional links. The resulting separation between maps reflected degree of hierarchical structure, but also reflected independent measures of student achievement. Pathfinder was then used to produce semantic networks from pooled data from high and low achievement groups using proximity matrices derived from the frequencies of paired concepts. The network constructed from maps of higher achievers (coherence measure = 0.18, linked pairs = 294, and number of subjects = 32) showed greater coherence, more concordance in specific paired links, more important specific conceptual relationships, and greater hierarchical organization than did the network constructed from maps of lower achievers (coherence measure = 0.12, linked pairs = 552, and number of subjects = 22). These differences are interpreted in terms of qualitative variation in knowledge organization by two groups of individuals with different levels of relative expertise (as reflected in achievement scores) concerning the topic of chemical equilibrium. The results suggest that the technique of transforming paired links in concept maps into proximity matrices for input to multivariate analyses provides a suitable methodology for comparing and documenting changes in the organization and structure of conceptual knowledge within and between individual students.

AB  - The purpose of this research is threefold: (1) to identify the difficulties that Grade 10 students in a Lebanese school have that hinder their conceptual understanding at the micro-macro-symbolic interface in chemistry, (2) to investigate the effect of a macro-micro-symbolic teaching approach on students' relational understanding of chemical reactions, and (3) to characterize students' conceptual profiles regarding their understanding of chemical reactions in terms of macro, micro, symbolic levels and the relations among them, at the end of the teaching sequence. Forty six 10th graders from two sections participated in the study. A student-centered approach was followed in both sections based on constructivist pedagogy. Hence the teacher played the role of a facilitator who guided students in a meaning making inductive learning process, through questioning, monitoring, validating, and clarifying ideas. Instruction in the experimental group was characterized by macro-micro-symbolic teaching that focuses on the interplay between the levels, integrates various representations, and engages students in an epistemic discourse about the nature of knowing in chemistry. Data sources for the study included a pre-test and two post-intervention tasks: a post-test and a concept map task, in addition to interviews with selected students from both sections. Findings indicated that macro-micro-symbolic teaching enhanced students' conceptual understanding and relational learning of chemical reactions. Besides, four assertions related to students' conceptual and epistemological thinking in response to the different teaching approaches are presented. Implications for instruction and for teacher education programs, as well as recommendations for further research, are discussed in light of these findings.

AB  - Background Chronic pain and pain catastrophization are growing problems across the United States, within the Hispanic-American population. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) changes pain knowledge and beliefs in many populations, but its impact on reconceptualization in people of Hispanic-American origin is unknown. Purpose Explore the changes in pain knowledge in Hispanic-American individuals and the process involved in reconceptualization following a PNE lecture. Methods Eight Hispanic-American adults participated in a mixed-methods exploratory study. The Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire (R-NPQ) was completed before, immediately after, and eight months after an adapted PNE lecture. A focus group involving four participants discussed the impact of PNE. Transcripts were translated and theme coded, and a concept map was developed by consensus. Results R-NPQ scores improved from 25.3% to 43.5% post-lecture, and the number of unsure responses decreased from 41.5% to 18.4%. At eight months, R-NPQ scores remained stable (44.2%) but unsure responses increased (28.9%). Themes that contributed to the process of change included cognitive dissonance, relevance of instruction, idea exchange through peer interaction, reflection, confidence, changed behaviors, and educational utility. Conclusion While small improvements in knowledge and perception of pain appeared to occur with the PNE, knowledge remained low. Consideration of adult learning principles such as applicability, peer-interaction, the confrontation of beliefs, and reflection throughout PNE may enhance its impact. Future investigation should explore the efficacy of this intervention, when compared or combined with other techniques in the treatment of Hispanic-Americans experiencing persistent pain.

AB  - The development and interest in mathematics textbooks in Indonesia have a considerable increase in the last decade. In this study, we discuss on structure analysis of Indonesian mathematics textbooks in Relation and Function Topics. We focused structure analysis of mathematics textbooks for 8th-grade students. Three Indonesian mathematics textbooks were analyzed for this study. An analysis framework was developed to investigate the characteristics of the structure in the textbooks from three perspectives: the physical features, the schematic of the math contents in the textbooks, and the patterns in the sequencing of content. We counted the distribution of block types, contents and performance expectation types to help us in examining and analyzing the structure of textbooks in relation and function topics for 8th grade. Our analysis showed that the three textbooks generally have a common structure. Firstly, the textbook A has more pages than the others. Mostly the textbook provided many learning activities with a scientific approach. Secondly, the schematics showed that the brief of structure of the three textbooks which have a common structure: 1) illustration about relation and function; 2) a concept map; 3) a set of narrations, learning activities, worked examples, and exercise to help students in understanding the topics; and 4) a competency test to examine whether students have achieved the aims of learning or not. Lastly, the patterns in sequencing content of the three textbooks showed that they have different patterns. Based on the results, recommendations are given for investigating the linkage between the structure of textbook and performance expectation in order to do further research on these topics.

AB  - In the last decade, as an emerging technique for business processes management, process mining (PM) has been applied in many domains, including manufacturing, supply-chain, government, healthcare, and software engineering. Particularly in healthcare, where most processes are complex, variable, dynamic, and multi-disciplinary in nature, the application of this technique is growing yet challenging. Several literature reviews, as secondary studies, reveal the state of PM applications in healthcare from different perspectives, such as clinical pathways, oncology processes, and hospital management. In this article, we present the results of a systematic mapping (SM) study which we conducted to structure the information available in the primary studies. SM is a well-accepted method to identify and categorize research literature, in which the number of primary studies is rapidly growing. We searched for studies between 2005 and 2017 in the electronic digital libraries of scientific literature, and identified 172 studies out of the 2428 initially found on the topic of PM in healthcare. We created a concept map based on the information provided by the primary studies and classified these studies according to a number of attributes including the types of research and contribution, application context, healthcare specialty, mining activity, process modeling type and notation/language, and mining algorithm. We also reported the demographics and bibliometrics trends in this domain; namely, publication volume, top-cited papers, most contributing researchers and countries, and top venues. The results of mapping showed that, despite the healthcare data and technique related challenges, the field is rapidly growing and open for further research and practice. The researchers who are interested in the field could use the results to elicit opportunities for further research. The practitioners who are considering applications of PM, on the other hand, could observe the most common aims and specialties that PM techniques are applied.

AB  - While the first year of medical school is challenging for all students, there may be specific issues for students from rural areas, economically disadvantaged backgrounds, ethnic minorities, or nontraditional age groups. A Summer Prematriculation Program (SPP) was created to prepare entering at-risk students for the demands of medical school. For the past 2 yr, an emphasis was placed on the development of appropriate study plans and skills. On presurveys, students predicted an increase in their number of study hours per lecture hour, from 7.6 h in undergraduate coursework to 9.1 h in medical school coursework (n = 35). These study plans were infeasible given the rigorous didactic lecture schedule in medical school. Interventions were made through lectures on study plans and modeling of appropriate study habits using engaging lectures in the SPP physiology course. At the end of the program, a postsurvey was given, and students reported a reduction in the planned hours of study to a more realistic 3.9 h of study time per hour of lecture. Furthermore, students planned to decrease their use of textbooks while increasing their use of concept mapping, videos, and peer teaching. The majority of students completing the SPP program with a study skills emphasis performed well in the Medical Physiology course, with 4 students honoring in the course, 27 students passing, and 2 students remediating the course after an initial failure. These results indicate that at-risk medical students may have inappropriate study plans that can be improved through participation in a program that emphasizes study skills development.

AB  - Introduction Accurate clinical decision-making of dentists should be based on their knowledge and experience. In the past 10 years, interest in competency-based dentistry education has rapidly increased, but there has been little attention paid to methods of improving dental education competency. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical presentation education model that provides opportunities for students to practice problem-solving from the moment they greet the patient so that students can obtain the practical experience of competency-based education and the effectiveness of this model can be confirmed through pilot test. Methods This article is divided two parts: First, developing the clinical presentation dental education model (CPDEM) and Second, a pilot study adopted CPDEM. To confirm the effectiveness of this model, the students' satisfaction, their perception of self-achievement were analysed. Results Clinical presentation dental education model has been developed to provide practice-related education experience and provide linkage between basic science and clinical science. The result of applying this education model to 10 students as a pilot test was shown an overall high satisfaction level. In addition, self-achievement students' reported of all intended competencies was higher than for non-participating students of this model. Conclusions This study focuses on practical education centring on clinical presentation. This model could get a meaningful and realistic experiences through the practice using clinical presentation of patients, use their metacognition for organizing and memorizing the patient's case by using concept map. It can be used as a future instructional method to enhance students' competency.

AB  - Introduction HIV continues to devastate the adolescent population in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The complex array of interpersonal, social, structural and system-level obstacles specific to adolescents have slowed progress in prevention and treatment of HIV in this population. The field of implementation science holds promise for addressing these challenges. Discussion There is growing consensus that enhanced interactions between researchers and users of scientific evidence are important and necessary to tackle enduring barriers to implementation. In 2017, the Fogarty International Center launched the Adolescent HIV Prevention and Treatment Implementation Science Alliance (AHISA) to promote communication and catalyse collaboration among implementation scientists and implementers to enhance the cross-fertilization of insights as research advances and the implementation environment evolves. This network has identified key implementation science questions for adolescent HIV, assessed how members' research is addressing them, and is currently conducting a concept mapping exercise to more systematically identify implementation research priorities. In addition, AHSA pinpointed common challenges to addressing these questions and discussed their collective capacity to conduct implementation science using the shared learning approach of the network. Specifically, AHISA addresses challenges related to capacity building, developing mentorship, engaging stakeholders, and involving adolescents through support for training efforts and funding region-/country-specific networks that respond to local issues and increase implementation science capacity across SSA. Conclusions Innovative platforms, like AHISA, that foster collaborations between implementation science researchers, policymakers and community participants to prioritizes research needs and identify and address implementation challenges can speed the translation of effective HIV interventions to benefit adolescent health.

AB  - Background:
   Ethical issues arise daily in the delivery of palliative care. Despite much (largely theoretical) literature, evidence from specialist palliative care practitioners about day-to-day ethical challenges has not previously been synthesised. This evidence is crucial to inform education and adequately support staff.
   Aim:
   To synthesise the evidence regarding the ethical challenges which specialist palliative care practitioners encounter during clinical practice.
   Design:
   Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO registration CRD42018105365). Quality was dual-assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Tabulation, textural description, concept mapping and thematic synthesis were used to develop and present the narrative.
   Data sources:
   Seven databases (MEDLINE, Philosopher's Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched from inception to December 2019 without language limits. Eligible papers reported original research using inductive methods to describe practitioner-reported ethical challenges.
   Results:
   A total of 8074 records were screened. Thirteen studies from nine countries were included. Challenges were organised into six themes: application of ethical principles; delivering clinical care; working with families; engaging with institutional structures and values; navigating societal values and expectations; philosophy of palliative care. Challenges related to specific scenarios/contexts rather than the application of general ethical principles, and occurred at all levels (bedside, institution, society, policy).
   Conclusion:
   Palliative care practitioners encounter a broad range of contextual ethical challenges, many of which are not represented in palliative care ethics training resources, for example, navigating institutional policies, resource allocation and inter-professional conflict. Findings have implications for supporting ethical practice and training practitioners. The lack of low- and middle- income country data needs addressing.

AB  - At present, the training of professionals in Higher Education challenges docents to incorporate in their teaching practice, not only expertise of pure disciplinary content, it also calls for associated aptitudes of didactic knowledge to guide the disciplinary knowledge. This study intends to contribute new teaching methodologies in the form of didactic software for Histology students in the Nursing Degree program, Faculty of Health Sciences of the Universidad Autonoma De Chile. These interactive modules were created as support for traditional classes and practical steps with microscopic observation. For the development of the first module, a total of 200 images were digitalized in JPG format. From those images presentations with personal animation were realized, which were then converted to Adobe Flash Player thus creating the first software entitled "Histological Module". We incorporated functional information to the initial module of histological preparation in addition to concept maps. This innovation was particularly attractive and we decided to modify the initial software, thereby creating the second program entitled "Histo-functional Module". To compare student perception on both modules a previously validated, voluntary and anonymous opinion survey was carried out that included questions on factors related to: content, motivation, utility, quality and quantity. Responses were evaluated by Likert scale. Results objectively reflected the favorable acceptance that the histo-functional Module has had on the part of our students. This is probably the result of this software integrating knowledge of structures and their function, affording it meaning and facilitating learning as well as motivating students in the study of histology.

AB  - The portability and immediate communication properties of mobile devices influence the learning processes in interacting with peers, accessing resources and transferring data. For example, the short message and browsing functions in a cell phone provide users with timely and adaptive information access. Although many studies of mobile learning indicate the pedagogical potential of mobile devices, the screen size, computational power, battery capacity, input interfaces, and network bandwidth are too restricted to develop acceptable functionality for the entire learning processes in a handheld device. Therefore, mobile devices can be adopted to fill the gap between Web-based learning and ubiquitous mobile learning. This study first creates a website, providing functions enabling learning to take place anytime and anywhere with any available learning device, for ubiquitous learning according to various properties of mobile devices. Nowadays, learners' behaviors on a website can be recorded as learning portfolios and analyzed for behavioral diagnosis or instructional planning. A student model is then built according to the analytical results of learning portfolios and a concept map of the learning domain. Based on the student model and learners' available learning devices, three modules are developed to build a ubiquitous learning environment to enhance learning performance via learning status awareness, schedule reminders and mentor recommendation. Finally, an experiment is conducted with 54 college students after implementation of the ubiquitous learning website. Experimental results indicate that the proposed system can enhance three learning performance indicators, namely academic performance, task accomplishment rates, and learning goals achievement rates.

AB  - This paper describes the development, implementation, and students' perceptions of a new trilayer approach of teaching (TLAT). The TLAT model involved blending lecture, in-class group activities, and out-of-class assignments on selected content areas and was implemented initially in a first-year integrated pharmacy course. Course contents were either delivered by traditional lectures or by the TLAT. A survey instrument was distributed by SurveyMonkey to determine students' perceptions of the TLAT model. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Students' performance in a total of 225 examination and quiz questions was analyzed to evaluate whether the TLAT model improved students' learning. Students' (n = 98) performance scores for TLAT-based and lecture-based questions were 83.3 +/- 10.2 and 79.5 +/- 14.0, respectively (P < 0.05). Ninety-three percent of students believed that in-class group activities enhanced conceptual understanding of course materials, helped them take responsibility of their own learning, and enhanced their overall learning experiences. More than 80% of respondents felt that solving cases and developing concept maps helped them sharpen creative and critical thinking skills. In addition, 90% of the respondents indicated that the homework throughout the semester helped them stay up to date and focused with the progress of the course. The use of the TLAT model led to an improvement in student learning of complex concepts. Moreover, the results suggest that this model improves students' self-reliance and attitudes toward learning. Our findings should serve as an impetus for inclusion of diverse active learning strategies in pharmacy education.

AB  - This study is aimed at assessing the effectiveness of the use of heuristics V Gowin and Conceptual Map for visualizing the process of building knowledge in research tasks; specifically to guide research, conceive of it as a process where the epistemology of science and methodology converge, and to facilitate communication of results. It is part of a research project at the School of Engineering ESIME in the National Polytechnic Institute of Mexico which lasted for three months and was conducted with students of the Computer Engineering Bachelor Degree. It is based on tools that help develop metacognitive strategies which are essential to conduct research. Qualitative methodology, the model of research action, facilitates data collection through a questionnaire, implemented at the beginning and end of the procedure, which makes evident students' beliefs on research, problems encountered during the procedure, the concept of building knowledge and personal assessment of both metacognitive tools, both in terms of development and in terms of their employment. Moreover, to recover evidence of student productions, a template that students adapt to their necessities is designed. The data analysis with a qualitative orientation allows obtaining results consistent with previous studies, reveals the effectiveness of the V of Gowin and Conceptual Map to perform research tasks since this approach facilitates the integration of theoretical and methodological frameworks, guides the process-its planning, monitoring and constant evaluation of the procedures. This approach does also help visualize the process of building knowledge, promoting metacognition, and increases the safety of students, besides helping to improve the communication of results.

AB  - At present, teachers seeking to meet the demanding needs of educational institutions through the planning and construction of web systems that facilitate the teaching-learning process. In particular, this research presents the design and implementation of Usable Adaptive Hypermedia System (SHAU) to perfect competence in students pursuing topics related to Boolean algebra. This study was conducted in two universities located in Mexico (Federal District) and is supported by the Quantitative Approach that demonstrates the improvement development level of achievement, skills and attitudes through the SHAU. The total sample is 82 students taking "Computational Mathematics" and "Sequential Logic and Combinatorics". The experimental method by analysis of variance (ANOVA) assesses academic performance (theoretical exam, laboratory practice and participation in the classroom) students who use the web interface and the control group (no use of technology). Through ANOVA with significance level of 0.05 and 0.01 states that the use of SHAU facilitates the teaching-learning process related to the Boolean algebra. The design of the SHAU allows show audiovisual content on Boolean algebra and teaching strategies (concept maps, tables and exercises) according to the characteristics and level of knowledge (adaptive assessment) of visual and auditory learners. Programming in HTML 5 has a key role because the SHAU allows students to access information on Boolean algebra through flexibility in browsers: Google Chrome, Opera and Internet Explorer and operating systems: Windows, Linux and MAC. Advances in science and pedagogy related to usability enable to create web systems that meet the demands of society related to the formation of active alumni and autonomous able to quickly join the workforce.

AB  - A computational framework has been developed for the construction and evaluation of metabolic pathways given input substrates and knowledge of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Application of the framework creates new and existing routes to both chemicals known to exist in biological systems and chemicals novel to biological systems. In the present application, we focus on biosynthetic routes to 7-carboxyindole, a specialty chemical currently produced by organic synthesis, using chorismate as a starting compound and the enzyme actions native to the biosynthetic route from chorismate to tryptophyan. Graph theory and its associated algorithms are exploited to represent molecules and perform enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Through repetitive application of the set of operators representing the enzymatic reactions of interest to the reactants and their progeny, reaction pathways are generated automatically. The concept of generalized enzyme function is introduced and defined as the third-level enzyme function (EC i.j.k) according to the four-digit transformations of the enzyme classification system (EC i.j.k.l). This concept maps enzyme-catalyzed reactions to transformations of functional groups and enables the generation of novel species and pathways. Thermodynamic properties are calculated using a group contribution method "on-the-fly" in order to provide one assessment of the relative feasibility of the novel pathways. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

AB  - Lifelong learning is a worldwide practice. It supposes another approach to learning and, consequently, to evaluation. In the present paper differences between traditional and lifelong learning are presented, and reasons to another type of evaluation are outlined. Lifelong learning offers a waste amount of assessment tools that aimed to develop individuals and increase their motivation. As an example of competence assessment with alternative assessment tools, one model of competence assessment of an information scientist is given in the present article.

T2  - TEACHER THINKING TWENTY YEARS ON: REVISITING PERSISTING PROBLEMS AND ADVANCES IN EDUCATION
CP  - 2nd International-Study-Association-on-Teaching-and-Thinking (TSATT) Conference
AB  - In this paper the development of teacher thinking is conceived in terms of knowledge structures, and declarative and procedural knowledge. A framework is set that comprises three interacting factors: the kind of knowledge, the location in which it develops, and the role assumed by the teacher (or student). This framework was used to identify transition points within each factor, at which changes in knowledge structures are expected to occur. Representations of knowledge structures are obtained by using a general analysis scheme for cognitive maps, which are constructed by individual students from a set of domain-related concepts. This procedure is exemplified by the application of the above scheme to the maps of one biology student teacher, which resulted in the specification of both his knowledge structures and their development over a short period of time.

AB  - Linear Optimization (LO) course is one of the important courses in Industrial Mathematics (IM) and Operations Research (OR) field of applied mathematics. As the curricula now change into a competency based curricula, thus the instructional objective, course content, and approaches of teaching have to be improved. We refer to Cochran (2009) in evaluating our pedagogy in teaching Linear Optimization. At Department of Mathematics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Universitas Padjadjaran Indonesia, especially for LO course, we plan to implement a student center learning using an active learning based on research for the coming academic year 2014/2015. Moazeni (2012) mentioned that, based on Liebman (1998), there are ten activities to promote active learning when teaching undergraduate OR courses, i.e., taxonomies, similarities and differences, forms and functions, advantages and disadvantages, type 1 frames, type 2 frames, concept mapping, metaphor and analogy, rehearsal, and advance organizer for instructor activity. These ten activities can be applied both in individual student activities in the classroom or group activities, in which case it is called as collaborative active learning. This collaborative active learning is recommended by Lasdon and Liebman (1998) to teach nonlinear programming. In this paper, we discuss how we adopt these ten activities in our teaching activity for the Linear Optimization course in our department. We also present how we introduce the students some results of our research on linear optimization application, i.e., in forestry tactical planning problem and vaccination strategy problem as real life example of the course applications.

TI  - The religion-in-the-science-classroom issue: Seeking graduate student conceptual change
T2  - SCIENCE EDUCATION
KW  - FRAMEWORK
AB  - This study examines the extent to which science education graduate students enjoy a well-articulated position on the compatibility of science and religion and, as a result, are comfortable with their espoused views and plans for the role of religion in science classroom discussions. We were particularly interested in examining changes in student mental states as a legitimate form of conceptual change after a course intervention. This might be evidenced by the depth of understanding, level of reasoning, and degree of comfort with classroom application. The intervention first asked students to write a "talk back to the author" paper shortly after reading a provocative essay on the topic. This was followed by reading and discussing a variety of alternative views after which they wrote a more formal position paper on the science-religion topic. We first conducted a content analysis of both papers, developing separate concept maps of the overall class response in the first and second papers, noting changes in emphases. Adapting a current multidimensional model of conceptual change, we then developed an individual evaluation form based on categories that emerged in the class analysis, which were strikingly similar to the categories in the multidimensional model. These included ontological, epistemological, and social/affective dimensions of conceptual change. Both papers were scored in these three areas. The conceptual change for each student from talk-back to position paper was subsequently reported using individual graphs and citing text examples. Results showed conceptual change or improved mental state in all three categories for most students. (C) 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Forest reserves are spaces of conservation and are often spaces of ecotourism as well. Evidence suggests that local community participation in the conservation of the forest reserve space tends to break down under weak ecotourism sector management. The Bossou Forest Reserve (BFR) in Guinea, West Africa has deteriorated considerably due to the fragmentation of the reserve and the inexorable decline in Bossou chimpanzee populations since the 1970s. The situation is largely attributable to several complex and interrelated factors, including the lack of established processes to support meaningful community participation in conservation and ecotourism planning. Ecotourism planning, with the participation of local communities, is considered to strengthen the management of the BFR and conservation connectivity. This paper reports on an approach to sustainable ecotourism planning of the BFR using the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) framework to determine the drivers of change and livelihood concerns. Fieldwork undertook in 2019 entailed concept mapping activities which were followed by a participatory geographic information system (PGIS) approach to support community-scale ecotourism planning that considers the multiple needs of stakeholders. Data analysis resulted in a community-centered situational assessment and classification of opportunities, both of which inform ecotourism planning and social-ecological resilience. The study provides baseline data for developing a robust ecotourism management plan capable of coping with the changing internal and external stressors. PGIS-based ecotourism planning can support community priorities and is potentially applicable to other West African areas with similar ecological and livelihood settings.

AB  - Competences required in the fields of Finance and Actuarial Sciences are getting more and more complex, diverse and interrelated. This fact constitutes a challenge for Higher Education instructors with a traditionally high degree of specialization, which is usually translated into fragmented curricular designs with scarce communication between courses. Trying to overcome this situation, we carried out a project at the Universidad de Malaga, in the fields of Finance and Actuarial Science, based on the development of collaborative projects involving pairs of courses. Students enrolled in any of these courses were required to develop during one term a collaborative project using the contents and competences of two courses. These competences are included, directly or indirectly, in the core syllabus for actuarial training of the Actuarial Association of Europe and the corresponding one of the International Actuarial Association. The aim of our project is enriching the learning process and its outcomes by means of (i) developing competences and contents of different courses in an interconnected manner and (ii) encouraging the acquisition of transversal competences, like oral skills and collaborative working, within a context closer to the real professional environment. For the former, lecturers of the courses chose hot topics that could be approached or allow interpretation form any of the involved courses. These topics only include a descriptive title and a question, thus allowing students to be creative and innovative, two aspects that were explicitly rewarded. However, to prevent a possible sensation of lack of guidance, a concept map was compulsory at mid-term and feedback was given. For the latter, students were required to present their final results in a role-play simulating a conference press. They were allowed to use any kind of additional materials, like brochures, posters, etc. The results of this experience have been highly satisfactory from both the perspective of the lecturers involved in the project and the students.' opinions, collected in a survey at the end of the term.

AB  - Lunar soils will be an important feedstock for multiple space resource utilization applications including preparing sites for infrastructure, extracting metals, manufacturing products. On Earth, soil classification systems provide a logical way to categorize different soils and are applied in soil surveys for development projects. However, these systems and others used for soil science are not appropriate to translate to the Moon because of fundamental differences in soil properties, especially clay and moisture content. Here, I propose a lunar soil classification system based on practical space resource use cases. The system includes bulk elemental composition and particle size distribution as its main variables to form 9 soil groups and can be extended with tags that represent additional properties like content or other mineral/elemental components. The system is designed to be simple to apply: classification criteria can be measured with in-situ instruments as as remote sensing. Proof of concept maps are developed globally, and the Apollo 17 sample collection is used as ground truth for orbital-derived classifications the Taurus-Littrow valley. The different soil groups are expected to perform better or poorer for specific use cases. For example, coarse grained soils will have higher flowability and higher compressibility that are important for excavation and conveyance. Mare composition soils will have lower melting points and are enriched FeO and TiO2 as sources of iron and titanium. Adopting a simple, standardized classification scheme will improve communication between different players assessing resources, developing and testing hardware, and eventually selling raw and refined lunar materials.

T2  - INNOVACION EDUCATIVA

KW  - teaching language and literature
KW  - key competencies
KW  - communicative competencies
AB  - This article presents the transversality of the learning of communicative competences in areas that are not strictly linguistic, such as reading comprehension in the resolution of mathematical or scientific problems, the elaboration of summaries and concept maps in study and learning techniques in the natural sciences and social studies, or the realization of oral discussions in the social sciences or civics. The main idea is that communicative competences are practiced with all type of subjects. Almost all the contents and competences that constitute the field of languages can be learned and improved: vocabulary, pronunciation, comprehension, study techniques and oral and written expression skills. Even in combination with other non-verbal and graphic languages. It is proposed to combine the specific disciplinary contents of any area with those of the language used and the underlying popular culture. A set of thematic possibilities and didactic activities is presented, showing the potential of this transversal approach. On the one hand, media such as the press, radio, television and new technologies will be used critically as sources of information. It is also suggested to take into account transversally literary genres such as theater, narration, poetry and song to contribute to the aesthetic formation.
   The content of the article is aimed at all stages of education, but if there were one that should be highlighted it would be Secondary Education because of the maturity of the students which allows them to read and comment on more complex texts, extensive works, watch films with a more defined message and write texts that come from collaborative work or extensive oral discussion among them. In the early stages, almost all learning is based on comprehensive, expressive and creative language.

AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts' concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9-16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students' knowledge more thoroughly.

AB  - Objective: To determine the extent to which perinatal mobile health applications (mHealth apps) are usable and desirable for women who seek information about childbearing.
   Design: A descriptive, qualitative research design.
   Setting: Through snowball sampling, participants were recruited from the social media sites Craigslist, Nextdoor, and Facebook and were asked to provide friends with a study invitation letter.
   Participants: Sixteen women who were pregnant or in the postpartum period and had used mHealth apps participated in the study.
   Methods: Semistructured interviews were conducted to determine how participants perceived and used mobile applications for information about pregnancy. Participants were then given a perinatal app and asked to find specific information with the use of a think-aloud process. Data were organized, coded, and then grouped into concept maps in an iterative process until themes emerged.
   Results: The themes that emerged were as follows: mHealth Apps Are a Source of Support During Childbearing, mHealth Apps Are Functional Tools, and There Are Limitations of mHealth Apps. Participants felt supported when they used mHealth apps because the information was personalized and they could use the apps to connect with family and the online community. mHealth apps have perceived limitations because women sometimes feel disconnected from the information they receive, some providers and families do not support their use, and security issues may be a concern.
   Conclusion: mHealth apps can be useful educational tools. Providers can support women by recommending select apps for use. Because of minimal oversight from app distribution platforms or health care organizations in the development and use of educational mHealth apps, a system to certify or verify mHealth apps should be developed.

AB  - The construction and reconstruction of meanings by learners requires that they actively seek to integrate new knowledge with knowledge already in their cognitive structure. Ausubel's assimilation theory of cognitive learning has been shown to be effective in guiding research and instructional design to facilitate meaningful learning (Ausubel, The psychology of meaningful verbal learning. New York: Grune and Stratton. 1903 Educational psychology: A cognitive view, New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1968 The acquisition and retention of knowledge. Dordrecht: Kluwer, 2000). Gowin's Vee heuristic has been employed effectively to aid teachers and students in understanding the constructed nature of knowledge (Gowin. Educating, Ithaca. NY: Cornell University Press, 198 1). "Situated learning" occurs when learning is by rote or at a lower level of meaningful learning. Concept mapping has been used effectively to aid meaningful learning with resulting modification of student's knowledge structures. When these knowledge structures are limited or faulty in some way, they may be referred to as Limited or Inappropriate Propositional Hierarchies (LIPH's). Conceptual change, or more accurately conceptual reconstrution, requires, meaningful learning to modify LIPH's. Collaborative group learning facilitates meaningful teaming and new knowledge construction, World-wide economic changes are forcing major changes in business and industry placing a premium on the power and value of knowledge and new knowledge production, These changes require changes in school and university education that centers on the nature and power of meaningful learning. New computer tools are available to facilitate teaching activities targeted at modifying LIPH's, and aiding meaningful learning in general. (C) 2002 Wiley Periodicals. Inc.

AB  - Introduction: Video-based review of surgical procedures has proven to be useful in training by enabling efficiency in the qualitative assessment of surgical skill and intraoperative decision-making. Current video segmentation protocols focus largely on procedural steps. Although some operations are more complex than others, many of the steps in any given procedure involve an intricate choreography of basic maneuvers such as suturing, knot tying, and cutting. The use of these maneuvers at certain procedural steps can convey information that aids in the assessment of the complexity of the procedure, surgical preference, and skill. Our study aims to develop and evaluate an algorithm to identify these maneuvers. Methods: A standard deep learning architecture was used to differentiate between suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting on a data set comprised of videos from practicing clinicians (N = 52) who participated in a simulated enterotomy repair. Perception of the added value to traditional artificial intelligence segmentation was explored by qualitatively examining the utility of identifying maneuvers in a subset of steps for an open colon resection. Results: An accuracy of 84% was reached in differentiating maneuvers. The precision in detecting the basic maneuvers was 87.9%, 60%, and 90.9% for suture throws, knot ties, and suture cutting, respectively. The qualitative concept mapping confirmed realistic scenarios that could benefit from basic maneuver identification. Conclusions: Basic maneuvers can indicate error management activity or safety measures and allow for the assessment of skill. Our deep learning algorithm identified basic ma-neuvers with reasonable accuracy. Such models can aid in artificial intelligence-assisted video review by providing additional information that can complement traditional video segmentation protocols. (c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

AB  - A thorough understanding of signal analysis is important for learning many specialized electrical engineering fields such as communication and digital signal processing. To date there has been a great deal of effort by engineering educators across the world to make this course easy to understand. However, the abstract and complex mathematical nature of the concepts involved in signal analysis and the disconnection of these concepts from daily life continue to pose a challenge in conceptually understanding signal analysis. This study addresses the mistakes and learning hurdles faced by electrical engineering undergraduate students while learning signal analysis and suggests possible reasons for these misconceptions and learning hurdles. The results of this study are established with the difficulties that appeared throughout the development of a detailed concept map of signal analysis using Fourier analysis techniques; during discussions with the experts in signal analysis; and from student responses to the questions in class tests and later during individual interviews. This study identifies the difficulties in conceptually learning signal analysis that arise from insufficient understanding of: (1) the difference between continuous and discrete domains, (2) discrete frequency, (3) units of Fourier series and Fourier transforms, (4) periodic/aperiodic or finite/infinite duration signals, (5) sampling, (6) aliasing and folding, (7) abstract mathematical concepts, and (8) advanced mathematical thinking ability. A few possible explanations for these learning hurdles are various p-prims, ontological miscategorization of discrete and continuous domain signals, and the lack of ability among students for advanced mathematical thinking. The knowledge of difficult concepts and the reasons behind the difficulties in learning signal analysis related topics is necessary for the design of an appropriate pedagogy for signal analysis related courses. While teaching signal analysis, careful attention to these learning hurdles and the possible related explanations will help to establish meaningful learning among students.

AB  - In recent years, the Internet has become an effective and accessible delivery mechanism for distance education. In 2003, 81% of all institutions of higher education offered at least one fully online or hybrid course. By 2005, the proportion of institutions that listed online education as important to their long-term goals had increased by 8%. This growth in available online courses and their increased convenience and flexibility have stimulated dramatic increases in enrollment in online programs, including the Veterinary Technology Distance Learning Program (VT-DLP) at Purdue University. Regardless of the obvious benefits, distance learning (DL) can be frustrating for the learners if course developers are unable to merge their knowledge about the learners, the process of instructional design, and the appropriate uses of technology and interactivity options into effective course designs.
   This article describes strategies that we have used to increase students' learning of physiology content in an online environment. While some of these are similar, if not identical, to strategies that might be used in a face-to-face (f2f) environment (e.g., case studies, videos, concept maps), additional strategies (e.g., animations, virtual microscopy) are needed to replace or supplement what might normally occur in a f2f course. We describe how we have addressed students' need for instructional interaction, specifically in the context of two foundational physiology courses that occur early in the VT-DLP. Although the teaching and learning strategies we have used have led to increasingly high levels of interaction, there is an ongoing need to evaluate these strategies to determine their impact on students' learning of physiology content, their development of problem-solving skills, and their retention of information.

AB  - In spite of the common belief that Chinese natural philosophy and medicine have a unique frame of reference completely foreign to the West, this article argues that they in fact have significant cognitive and epistemic similarities with certain esoteric health beliefs of pre-Christian Europe. From the standpoint of Cognitive Science, Chinese Medicine appears as a proto-scientific system of health observances and practices based on a symptomological classification of disease using two elementary dynamical- processes pattern categorization schemas: a hierarchical and combinatorial inhibiting activating model (Yin-Yang), and a non-hierarchical and associative five-parameter semantic network (5-Elements/Agents). The concept-map of the five-parameter model amounts to a pentagram, a commonly found geomantic and spell casting sigil in a number of pre-Christian health and safety beliefs in Europe, to include the Pythagorean cult of Hygieia, and the Old Religion of Northern Europe. This non-hierarchical pattern-recognition archetype/ prototype was hypothetically added to the pre-existing hierarchical one to form a hybrid nosology that can accommodate for a change in disease perceptions. The selection of five parameters rather than another number might be due to a numerological association between the integer five, the golden ratio, the geometry of the pentagram and the belief in health and wholeness arising from cosmic or divine harmony. In any case, this body of purely empirical knowledge is nowadays widely flourishing in the US and in Europe as an alternative to Western Medicine and with the claim of being a unique, independent and comprehensive medical system, when in reality it is structurally-and perhaps historically-related to the health and safety beliefs of pre-Christian Europe; and without the prospect for an epistemological rupture, it will remain built upon rudimentary cognitive modalities, ancient metaphysics, and a symptomological view of disease.

AB  - Background Local implementation of guidelines for pneumonia care is strongly recommended, but the context of care that affects implementation is poorly understood. In a learning health care system, computerized clinical decision support (CDS) provides an opportunity to both improve and track practice, providing insights into the implementation process.
   Objectives This article examines physician interactions with a CDS to identify reasons for rejection of guideline recommendations.
   Methods We implemented a multicenter bedside CDS for the emergency department management of pneumonia that integrated patient data with guideline-based recommendations. We examined the frequency of adoption versus rejection of recommendations for site-of-care and antibiotic selection. We analyzed free-text responses provided by physicians explaining their clinical reasoning for rejection, using concept mapping and thematic analysis.
   Results Among 1,722 patient episodes, physicians rejected recommendations to send a patient home in 24%, leaving text in 53%; reasons for rejection of the recommendations included additional or alternative diagnoses beyond pneumonia, and comorbidities or signs of physiologic derangement contributing to risk of out- patient failure that were not processed by the CDS. Physicians rejected broad-spectrum antibiotic recommendations in 10%, leaving text in 76%; differences in pathogen risk assessment, additional patient information, concern about antibiotic properties, and admitting physician preferences were given as reasons for rejection.
   Conclusion While adoption of CDS recommendations for pneumonia was high, physicians rejecting recommendations frequently provided feedback, reporting alternative diagnoses, additional individual patient characteristics, and provider preferences as major reasons for rejection. CDS that collects user feedback is feasible and can contribute to a learning health system.

AB  - Summarized are research findings and policy implications obtained over a 5 year period (51 teachers, 1200 students) from the implementation of an in-depth expanded applications of science (IDEAS) model with average, above average, and at-risk students in grades 2-5. The IDEAS model replaced the time allocated for traditional reading/language arts instruction with a daily 2 hour time-block dedicated solely to in-depth science concept instruction which encompassed reading comprehension and language arts skills (e.g. concept-focused teaching, hands-on activities, utilization of science process skills, reading of science print materials, concept map construction, journal writing). The multi-year results revealed a consistent pattern of the model's effectiveness in improving both the science understanding (effects on the Metropolitan Achievement Test-Science ranged from 0.93 to 1.6 grade equivalents) and reading achievement (effects on the Iowa Test of Basic Skills-Reading and the Stanford Achievement Tests-Reading ranged from 0.3 to 0.5 grade equivalents). Participating students also consistently displayed significantly more positive attitudes and self-confidence toward both science and reading. Interpreting the findings, the IDEAS model was considered to provide clear evidence for the importance of focusing the teaching-learning process on the conceptual structure of the curricular knowledge to be learned in a fashion consistent with research and policy issues raised by the recent TIMSS study. Also discussed was the role of the IDEAS model as a means for linking theoretical perspectives from instructional design and cognitive science to science educational reform.

AB  - Objectives: Extracting data from publication reports is a standard process in systematic review (SR) development. However, the data extraction process still relies too much on manual effort which is slow, costly, and subject to human error. In this study, we developed a text summarization system aimed at enhancing productivity and reducing errors in the traditional data extraction process.
   Methods: We developed a computer system that used machine learning and natural language processing approaches to automatically generate summaries of full-text scientific publications. The summaries at the sentence and fragment levels were evaluated in finding common clinical SR data elements such as sample size, group size, and PICO values. We compared the computer-generated summaries with human written summaries (title and abstract) in terms of the presence of necessary information for the data extraction as presented in the Cochrane review's study characteristics tables.
   Results: At the sentence level, the computer-generated summaries covered more information than humans do for systematic reviews (recall 91.2% vs. 83.8%, p < 0.001). They also had a better density of relevant sentences (precision 59% vs. 39%, p < 0.001). At the fragment level, the ensemble approach combining rule-based, concept mapping, and dictionary-based methods performed better than individual methods alone, achieving an 84.7% F-measure.
   Conclusion: Computer-generated summaries are potential alternative information sources for data extraction in systematic review development. Machine learning and natural language processing are promising approaches to the development of such an extractive summarization system. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background: As health care technologies continue to advance rapidly, resulting in improved standards of practice, it is essential for health care professionals to continually expand on their current skills and knowledge. We describe here an initiative to use open education resources to provide ongoing education in radiation medical sciences and imaging.
   Aims: The aim of this study to design an interactive, engaging, multilevel radiation medical physics resource, which is fully open to the public, and functional on all types of computing devices. Our primary target audiences are students and workers in medical radiation technology and other health care professionals as part of their continuing professional development.
   Design and Development: The three tasks of design, development, and content creation were most efficiently performed in parallel wherever possible. A modern responsive web design was adopted to target all desktop and mobile devices. Only open-source tools and libraries were used in developing the OpenPhys website.
   Overall Website Design and Navigation: The homepage is a modern tile-based design containing one coloured tile for each lesson. Clicking anywhere on a coloured lesson tile will open up a two-dimensional interactive concept map linking to content pages. Currently, 10 lessons are available online ranging from the electronic structure of the atom to MRI basics: "NMR'' and "Inside a Pixel''. Lesson pages include text, images, graphics, equations, quizzes, and interactive animations.
   User Feedback: An online questionnaire was emailed to current radiation therapy students at the University of Alberta and alumni regarding the functionality and navigation of the website.
   Discussion/Conclusion: To our knowledge, OpenPhys is the first open education resource specializing in radiation physics and medical imaging. We believe OpenPhys will fill existing gaps in the realm of physics education delivery and could be a component of a blended learning initiative. Future steps will include a formal evaluation of the website and content.

AB  - This study aimed to examine the impact of years of experience and field of expertise on the development of chemistry knowledge structures from STEM experts comprising 103 professors, 10 postdocs, and 146 doctoral students. Of these participants, 127 were specialized in chemistry and the rest were from various science and engineering disciplines. Although most participants were part of a research university located in Northern California, the pool included a small group of experts from different universities and countries. The main source of the data was a Word Association Test generated with 17 keywords that refer to major topics or concepts commonly introduced in the general chemistry curricula. The knowledge structures were examined to determine if the contents and the orientations of the clusters varied between the expert groups. In addition, their analysis was enriched with the consideration of chemistry triplet designations and central terms identified by eccentricity values on each structure. The overall expert knowledge structure generated in this study was also compared to undergraduate structures determined by using the same instrument and methodology. The investigation of the structures revealed several differences between expert groups and provided insight into the transformation of novices into experts. The paper also presents practical suggestions for educators on how to utilize structures while teaching, informing their instructional practices, and reforming teaching materials.

AB  - Multiple intelligences theory (MIT) which takes into account students' individual differences has an important role in the teaching and learning process. In this study a novel learning environment based on MIT which takes students' interests and needs into an account has been developed. Many activities were carried out depending on students' intelligence types. The effects of different activities on students' achievements, attitudes toward chemistry and retention of knowledge in periodical features' variety at the 10th class were measured and compared. The comparison between experimental group, which was instructed through MIT learning strategies and materials, and control group thought by traditional methods was observed. The research was applied in the first semester of 2009-2010 education years. The study carried out on 75 high school students in Izmir. The application of the study was lasted for 8 weeks containing methods and tests' practices. Following MIT assessment survey, achievement test and attitude scales were used to analyze its effectiveness. Based on the theories and literature data, an instructional material included concept maps, puzzles, stories, classical music in background, group games, and photos about periodic features' variety as an alternative to traditional written material. As a result of statistical analysis there were significant differences between achievement post-test and attitudes post-test towards chemistry course of control and experimental groups. Consequently, instructional methods needed to be varied so students could use their intellectual strengths to better understand topics, increase their intrinsic motivation, intervention and encourage active student engagement to improve learning at middle school level.

AB  - We propose using three theories to develop pathophysiology courses. Gestalt theory supports students' abilities to integrate information holistically. Critical Pedagogy shows students how to recognize biases and inequalities, critique scientific information, and lead future health care reforms. Humanism encourages the development of empathy and interpersonal skills. Our paper describes the philosophical underpinnings of these theoretical perspectives, examines the relevance to nursing education, provides a sample pathophysiology course outline, and gives recommendations for future programs.(c) 2023 Organization for Associate Degree Nursing.

AB  - "Didn't understand or not fully understand" is the most common situation that students experience when they learn medical biochemistry and molecular biology (MBMB). Therefore, the primary task of teaching MBMB is to help students overcome the difficulties in "conceptual understanding." The core of the solution to these problems lies in the acquisition and application of cognitive skills. The key to applying Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory (A's CAT) is to expand the knowledge capacity of students' cognitive structure through the purposeful "production" and employment of advanced organizers, with which students can replace "rote learning" with "meaningful learning" and ultimately develop an interest in MBMB courses. The results showed that the application of A's CAT did not only encourage the students to use cognitive skills to learn and understand MBMB knowledge and overcome the barrier to learning that results from the characteristics of the MBMB course, but also expanded and deepened the MBMB course contents. As a branch of learning theory, A's CAT provides practical methods for the several hypotheses of learning theory. Among these, the advanced organizer strategy realizes the organization and reorganization of new knowledge; the progressive differentiation strategy reduces the difficulty of complex and abstract knowledge; the implementation of the advanced organizer strategy and integrative reconciliation strategy forms the concept map. Taken together, the application of A's CAT includes cognitive strategy and metacognitive strategy when the cognitive process is conducted in a meaningful way. More importantly, application of A's CAT guides students to participate in active learning and builds "scaffolding" for the teaching/learning MBMB of student-centered goals.

AB  - Location, as the fundamental concept in geography, is important for all sciences that study objects and behaviours in geo-space. Although other disciplines are capable of formulating definitions of location and geo-space, they nevertheless look up to geography to devise and articulate a comprehensive and practical concept of everything geographic'. Essentially quantitative in its concern, geography has yet to quantify the concept of geo-space in order to both fulfil the ancient Greeks' vision of geography and advance it for use in other disciplines. We revisit the epistemological and broader philosophical principles of geo-space and apply these principles to identifying and quantifying the key aspects of geo-space: topos, choros and geos. Rather than following the narrow numerical tradition of quantitative geography and GIS, we adopt broader philosophical perspective of Kant on Quantity (Unity, Multiplicity, Totality) and argue that the natural' extension of the classical approach to geo-space necessitates its further philosophical quantification. We show that the ancient Greeks' concept maps into locations (topos), spatial relations (choros) and topology (geos). Extending the concept further necessitates the use of the language of set theory for defining basic concepts. We show that the result is both tractable and quantifiable, connects classical with modern and completes the definition of geo-space on all three levels of Quantity (unity, multiplicity, totality). We demonstrate the tractability of thus defined concept by reinterpreting Tobler's First Law of geography in theoretically sound terms. We show that a refined, modern concept of geo-space is both philosophically fulfilling and practically useful - some properties of geo-space are too important to be ignored or distorted.

AB  - Literature on science conceptions research and field investigations was used to probe alternative conceptions of primary school pupils. Theoretical studies from the literature have shown that there are many emphases on the physical meaning and the effects drawn by philosophers of science leading to the formation of new paradigms concerning science conceptions research. Our focus on primary school pupils' alternative conceptions pertaining to batteries (ACCB), in six phases, was to ( 1) analyse the context regarding batteries present in primary school; ( 2) summarize propositional statements and develop a target concept map on batteries; ( 3) edit protocols for interviews; ( 4) collect and analyse pupils' ACCB; ( 5) use the results from phases ( 1) -( 4) to construct a two-tier diagnostic instrument; and ( 6) submit our instrument with others to carry out tests in a National Science Concept Learning Study (NSCLS). Interview results from 21 primary school pupils show that the characteristics of their ACCB can be categorized into several conceptual models related to language, learning processes, and public media. From the NSCLS, two-tier test data depict the ACCB of the primary school pupils in Taiwan. Many alternative conceptions are significantly related to language and daily life in Taiwan. ACCB in this research can be categorized as either content free or content specific. Conception models based on content free and content specific are presented according to the properties of the ACCB. Our joint venture on concept formation research has been affected by the four temporal paradigms formed at certain prominent historical landmarks in science conceptions research. Our data also show a degree of general similarity with existing literature on science conceptions research.

KW  - BIOLOGY
AB  - We consider conceptions of history as schemata that integrate large portions and many aspects of knowledge. We describe the use of cognitive mapping for the identification of historical conceptions by examining whether adolescents' historical knowledge can be characterized according to widespread lay distinctions between critical and traditional orientations towards the past. We present cognitive maps of three of 12 18-year-old students which were identified as possessing qualities that make them come close to serving as 'ideal conceptions' of Jewish history: the 'theological', 'sociological', and 'critical/historical'. These conceptions are considered in relation to a discussion concerning (1) the applicability of cognitive mapping in the face of an apparent contrast between the seemingly linear character of historical knowledge and its spatial representation; and (2) the conception, held by many faith schools, of the development of historical knowledge as a contest between tradition and criticism.

AB  - The rapid growth in science and technology has affected societies and change has become inavitable in a short time. Human profile in our society has changed as a result of this growth. From this point of view, nowadays the aim of education is defined as training individuals who can meet the needs of the society and who are appropriate to the information era.
   In accordance with these developments, the Ministry of Education in our country started to deal with instructional programmes and improve them using a new approache. These new instructional programmes are based on training people by the way of active participation of the students in teaching-learning process. Thus, students will be able to reach the information they need, use it for their purposes and share it with interested parties.
   Furthermore measurement and evaluation system has been also changed according to the new programme. In this new approach students have an active role in the assessment process; individual differences are always considered and the parents are informed about the students' progress in each stage. Therefore, using methods such as portfolio assessment, performance assessment, self-assessment, peer assessment and also assessment tools such as rubrics, projects, concept mapping have become compulsory.
   Within this framework in this article, the concept of performance will be explained briefly and rubric as a prominent assessment tool will be discussed thoroughly. Rubric is an assessment tool that lists the criteria for a piece of work, or "what counts", it also articulates gradations of quality for each criterion, from excellent to poor. In rubric the assessment standards are given to the students before starting their study so that they know on which basis their performance would be evaluated. Sharing of all these information with parents and students would help what is expected from student work in a concrete way. Thus, parents and students will be equipped with detailed information about expectations and assessment standarts.

AB  - This paper aimed to present a learning model using virtual field trips (VFTs) with inquiry learning and critical thinking process to enhance science learning outcomes of lower secondary students based on the research and development. Phase 1 of this paper showed the process of develop a learning model and phase 2 showed the result of implementation with the lower secondary school students. After implementation, the learning model was revised using qualitative data from observation, students' opinion from a survey, and the assessment from experts. The research instruments used to assess science learning outcomes were the test for assessing students' skills of concept mapping, retrieval information, meaningful communication, and critical thinking. Samples were 104 Science teachers, 26 Science education experts, 31 students attending the 8th grade of a secondary school, and 5 instructional design experts. This VFTs learning model with inquiry learning and critical thinking process consisted of five main components: 1) Content and Activities, 2) VFTs media and resources (video clips, pictures, animations, online diaries, worksheets, activity sheets, and games), 3) experts from the field trips resources, 4) a learning management system for virtual field trip, and 5) assessment and evaluation. There were three phases of learning activities: 1) Pre-using the VFT activities (1 week), 2) During the VFT activities (2 weeks), and 3) Post-using the VFT activities (2 weeks). All phases included 6 learning steps: engagement, investigation and exploration, explanation, conclusion, elaboration, and evaluation. The results of exploring effectiveness of the VFTs learning model from one group pretest posttest experimental research design showed the students' science learning outcomes posttest scores had significantly higher than the pretest at a level of significance of .05 and five experts' assessment before and after try-out the model were appropriate in high level.

AB  - The production of a computer program requires learners to be skilled in basic concepts of programming, to master mathematical formulas, appropriate syntax usage, and in-depth knowledge of programming languages. Typically, in forming a program, students should be able to identify problems, generate algorithms, and convert algorithms into program code according to the syntax. Therefore, a Java programming course requires a student to master cognitive thinking in which, students can recover knowledge by using 'retrieval-based learning' as a basic recollection strategy in learning programming languages. The retrieval-based learning method refers to the following five waves: mnemonic, semantic, episodic context account, map concept, and quiz. Through these five waves, students should be able to implement retrieval method such as producing their own practice questions, quizzes, scan cards, to rewrite learning, repainting of learning, and concept maps. Instructional materials should include formative (topical) assessment, emphasis on text and content requirements, use of open-ended questions (subjective), answers or feedback, repeating exercises, and student achievement estimation. The main contribution is to create a descriptive Java programming lesson, which includes the choice of difficult topics, learning activities, teaching and learning modules, and online learning. However, the initial purpose of this study is to determine the most difficult topics in Java programming, the retrieval based learning used by students, as well as online student learning modules among students in Diploma of Computer Science (Programming) in vocational colleges. The instrument used to collect the data is through an online questionnaire and the findings were analysed using SPSS software by giving the percentage value for each element studied. The sample of the study was 110 students in Diploma of Computer Science (Programming) from four vocational colleges in Malaysia. The findings from the preliminary study conducted by the researcher are presented in detail in this paper.

AB  - Aim and objectives. To examine how nurses collect and use cues from respiratory assessment to inform their decisions as they wean patients from ventilatory support.
   Background. Prompt and accurate identification of the patient's ability to sustain reduction of ventilatory support has the potential to increase the likelihood of successful weaning. Nurses' information processing during the weaning from mechanical ventilation has not been well-described.
   Design. A descriptive ethnographic study exploring critical care nurses' decision-making processes when weaning mechanically ventilated patients from ventilatory support in the real setting.
   Methods. Novice and expert Scottish and Greek nurses from two tertiary intensive care units were observed in real practice of weaning mechanical ventilation and were invited to participate in reflective interviews near the end of their shift. Data were analysed thematically using concept maps based on information processing theory. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained.
   Results. Scottish and Greek critical care nurses acquired patient-centred objective physiological and subjective information from respiratory assessment and previous knowledge of the patient, which they clustered around seven concepts descriptive of the patient's ability to wean. Less experienced nurses required more encounters of cues to attain the concepts with certainty. Subjective criteria were intuitively derived from previous knowledge of patients' responses to changes of ventilatory support. All nurses used focusing decision-making strategies to select and group cues in order to categorise information with certainty and reduce the mental strain of the decision task.
   Conclusions. Nurses used patient-centred information to make a judgment about the patients' ability to wean. Decision-making strategies that involve categorisation of patient-centred information can be taught in bespoke educational programmes for mechanical ventilation and weaning. Relevance to clinical practice. Advanced clinical reasoning skills and accurate detection of cues in respiratory assessment by critical care nurses will ensure optimum patient management in weaning mechanical ventilation.

AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled "Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)" has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students' learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed.

AB  - The newly created concentration in bioprocess engineering at East Carolina University was developed with a novel curriculum designed to engage the students and improve their mastery of concepts using proven pedagogical approaches. This study presents the development of nine instructional modules for three bioprocess engineering courses (three modules per course) and the assessment of the effectiveness of the instructional modules. Each module is initiated by presenting the students with a challenge question. The students work on the challenge by completing a cycle of exercises that are designed to engage critical thinking and self-assessment, and for making connections among concepts within the course. The module culminates with students presenting their 'answer' to the challenge through various means, such as a report, poster, video, exam, etc. Of the nine modules, three are integrated through the different bioprocess engineering courses. This integration provides a theme for the students to make connections among the different courses and to transfer concepts to new situations. Our work sought to provide the answers to two research questions: 1) Did the students master the facts, skills, and concepts of bioprocess engineering through the use of the modules? and 2) Did the use of the modules create an effective How People Learn (HPL) learning environment within the three bioprocess engineering courses? The results of the assessment indicate that the modules were effective in developing the students' mastery of the facts, skills, and concepts across all three courses and created a very effective HPL learning environment in two of the three courses.

AB  - Disease ecology is a rapidly growing subdiscipline, and mammals and their parasites feature prominently in both historical and more recent research efforts. Nevertheless, the diversity of topics explored, and those not well explored, has not been systematically assessed. We conducted a systematic review of the published scientific literature in disease ecology of mammals and subjected the collection of original and review articles identified to a topic modeling approach, which is based on the words used in the published texts and their contexts (i.e., the frequency and strength of their semantic relationships with one another). In addition to concept maps identifying the most prominent research themes, we identified eight (not mutually exclusive) subcategories of studies, including experimental, theoretical, comparative, behavioral, immunological-microbiological, biogeographic-macroecological, vector-focused (e.g., mosquitoes), and disturbance-focused. The most prominent themes arising in review papers included the ecology of zoonotic diseases transmitted from non-human mammals, comparisons of pathogen prevalence between mammalian species, and pathogen discovery-disease surveillance studies, particularly of marine mammals and bats. For the original articles, the most prominent themes included ecology of rodent-transmitted viral and bacterial diseases and the population biology of zoonotic hosts. Most studies used comparative or descriptive approaches to investigate mammal-pathogen-disease relationships at a local scale, focusing on vector-borne diseases. Experimental, modeling, immunological, and behavioral approaches were strikingly underrepresented. Topics of strong conceptual importance, but that are underrepresented in the current literature, include: 1) the effects of the population density of mammalian hosts, and manipulations of density, on pathogen transmission; 2) macroecological studies that quantify effects of mammalian host species on parasite abundance and prevalence; and 3) effects of climate change on physiological and behavioral processes relevant to mammal-parasite interactions.

AB  - Coastal social-ecological systems (SES) are essential for the wellbeing of coastal communities and the wider society. However, in many parts of the world coastal SES face rapid change, and ultimately degradation. In this paper we unravel the mechanisms and implications of change in coastal SESmobilising multiple sources of knowledge, including scientific, expert-based and traditional and local knowledge (TLK). We focus on the rapidly changing Nakatsu mudflat in Japan, and combine primary and secondary data elicited through a mixed-method participatory approach that mobilised local stakeholders with different types of engagement with (and knowl-edge of) the mudflat. Through 4 expert interviews and 40 questionnaire surveys we identified the main ecosystem services provided by the mudflat that are perceived to be essential to the wellbeing of the local community. Although practically all respondents identified food provision as an important mudflat ecosystem services, many also pointed to the importance of some cultural (e.g. aesthetic beauty, spirituality, education and knowledge) and supporting services (e.g. habitat provision, sediment formation/retention). Through 8 Focus Group Discussions (FGD) and concept mapping we identified and systematized the underlying direct and indirect drivers of ecosystem change in the Nakatsu mudflat. These include population ageing and shrinking, economic diversification, and technological change that have collectively eroded TLK practices associated with the sus-tainable use of the mudflat. We also identified the mechanisms mediating these drivers and how they unfold in reality. Our study demonstrates that participatory processes engaging multiple stakeholders with different types of knowledge can provide rich and useful information on coastal SES change, which might not be readily obvious from simple headline indicators such as the change in the extent of the SES.

AB  - Research in contemporary biology has become increasingly complex and organized around understanding biological processes in the context of systems. To better reflect the ways of thinking required for learning about systems, we developed and implemented a pedagogical approach using box-and-arrow models (similar to concept maps) as a foundational tool for instruction and assessment in an Introductory Biology course on genetics, evolution, and ecology. Over the course of one semester, students iteratively constructed, evaluated, and revised Gene-to-Evolution (GtE) models intended to promote understanding about the connections linking molecular-level processes with population-level outcomes. In practice, a successful GtE model contextualizes information provided in a case study and explains how genetic-level variation originates at the molecular level, is differentially expressed among individuals, and is acted upon by the environment to produce evolutionary change within a population. Our analyses revealed that students' ability to construct biologically accurate models increased throughout the semester. Model complexity peaked near mid-term then subsequently declined. This suggests that, with time, students were building more parsimonious models, shedding irrelevant information, and improving in their ability to apply accurate and appropriate biological language to explain relationships among concepts. Importantly, we observed the greatest relative gains in model correctness among students who entered the course with lower mean GPA. In an analysis comparing performance among achievement tritiles, lower-performing students effectively closed the achievement gap with the highest performing students by the end of the semester. Our findings support the effectiveness of model-based pedagogies for science teaching and learning, and offer a perspective on pedagogical application of modeling strategies to foster systems thinking and knowledge structuring in college-level biology.

AB  - Despite the last 40 years of research showing that computer-aided diagramming tools improve student learning, very little research reveals the cognitive processes that explain why and how diagramming tools and specific features of the tools affect learning. This study developed a tool that graduate students used to diagram and analyze arguments as the tool mined each students' actions. The mined data was used to develop algorithms to operationalize and measure the use of backward, forward, breadth, depth-first reasoning. Regression models were then compared to identify which algorithm produced measures that best predicted diagram scores, and to determine the combined and relative impact of each reasoning process on diagram scores. The findings show that observing the placement and location of the first five nodes moved and positioned on screen in relation to the location of the previously moved node provides sufficient data to generate backward/forward and breadth/depth-first ratio scores that predict diagram scores, while individual frequency counts of each of the four processes do not predict scores. The best-fit regression model using the ratio scores show that students using more backward and depth-first processing construct diagrams with higher scores - scores based on criteria that gauge the depth of analysis and not just the number of correct diagram links. This study presents new tools, methods, and new lines of inquiry to advance research on ways to integrate learning analytics into computer-aided diagramming tools.

AB  - Digital games have become a popular source of entertainment. The main reason that players continue to play video games is that the game designers use scaffolding to bridge the gap between a player's current skills and those needed to be successful at the next level. Several mainstream digital games have the flexibility to become promising game-based learning environments, in which scaffolding could play a crucial role to improve the learning experience. This study examines the effectiveness of providing instructors with the opportunity to tailor a digital game in order to meet their personal teaching goals. The built-in game features in Crayon Physics Deluxe are blended with instructor-designed scaffolding to see whether such features can assist learning without impeding creativity. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups. In three of the groups, Crayon Physics Deluxe was used with varied scaffolding conditions: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, and marking critical features scaffolding. The fourth group did not play the game. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and creativity performance (in the form of game episode designs). The results show that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and in the sensitivity dimension of design creativity. The group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of creativity when designing their own game episodes. These findings suggest that proper scaffolding does facilitate learning, and different learning purposes require various designs of scaffoldings.

AB  - Nowadays society is involved in the continuous development of three important blocks of knowledge, electronic systems, computer science and the telecommunications networking. This paper describes the introduction of these three technological blocks of knowledge in practical teaching of technical studies particularized over a electronic instrumentation lab. The proposed system, developed by the department of Electronic Engineering at the University of Seville, shows the implementation of an automotive security system scale model which employs a convectional cellular phone as a telecontrol system, improving the learning process of the students and fomenting the students' participation.

AB  - Simply placing electronic geoscience resources such as datasets, methods, ontologies, workflows and articles in a digital library or cyberinfrastructure does not mean that they will be used successfully by other researchers or educators. It is also necessary to provide the means to locate potentially useful content, and to understand it. Without suitable provision for these needs, many useful resources will go undiscovered, or else will be found but used inappropriately. In this article, we describe an approach to discovering, describing and understanding e-resources based on the notion that meaning is carried in the interconnections between resources and the actors in the cyberinfrastructure (including individuals, groups, organizations), as well as by ontologies and conventional metadata. Navigation around this universe is achieved by implementing the idea of perspectives as dynamic, conceptual views (defined by SPARQL-like queries against an OWL schema) that not only act as filters, but also dynamically promote and demote concepts, relationships and properties according to their immediate relevance. We describe a means to represent a wide variety of interactions between resources using the notion of a knowledge nexus, and we illustrate its use with resources and actors from the Geosciences Network (GEON) cyberinfrastructure community. We also closely link browsing and visualizing strategies to our nexus, drawing on ideas from semiotics to move resources and connections not currently of interest from the foreground to the background, and vice versa, using a new form of adaptive perspective. We illustrate our ideas via ConceptVista, an open-source concept mapping application that provides rich, visual depictions of the resources, cyber-community and myriad connections between them. Examples are presented that show how geoscientific knowledge can be explored not only via ontological structure, but also by use cases, social networks, citation graphs and organization charts; all of which may carry some aspects of meaning for the user.

AB  - Knowledge and motivation of a teacher are two unchallenged, essential characteristics for successful education. Whilst the relevance of teachers' professional knowledge for successful students' learning has been studied in a sophisticated manner for years, the meaning of teachers' motivational orientations for students' performance still lacks a differentiated consideration. This construct is conceptualized by three domains: (1) self-efficacy, (2) subject-specific enthusiasm, and (3) enthusiasm for teaching the subject. Motivational orientations overall have shown to be relevant predictors of students' learning. However, there are several dimensions of motivation and their relative importance remains unclear. Our study goes beyond the available findings by considering in detail each of the three domains' relations to students' performance. Thus, we aim to further contribute to the clarification of the predictors of students' performance in school teaching. For this purpose, we conducted a study with 48 biology teachers and their 1036 students. To assess the three domains of teachers' motivational orientations, we applied paper and pencil tests. Concept maps and paper and pencil tests were used to measure students' performance. By specifying multilevel structural equation models, we examined the relationship between the domains of teachers' motivational orientations and the performance of the students. Our results reveal no relationship between teachers' self-efficacy and students' performance, but a significant positive relationship between the latter and teachers' subject-specific enthusiasm. Moreover, our results show a positive trend in the relationship between enthusiasm for teaching the subject and students' performance. The results provide a differentiated picture about the importance of motivational orientations for the characterisation of an effective teacher. We discuss our findings in terms of possible effect mechanisms and their relevance for further research on teacher motivation and the improvement of teacher education programmes.

AB  - This paper aims to contribute to the field of knowledge surrounding Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) curricula with a view to filling a gap in ESD literature by identifying features that may help ESD course designers. The study asks the questions: what is taught in ESD courses in higher education? and what content do students say they like? Working within the constructivist tradition, this study involved two groups of participants: 13 ESD design/delivery participants from six universities based in five countries (Group One) and 737 ESD students (Group Two) from three of those universities. The overarching methodology of comparative analysis was used to address the research questions. Data collection included course learning materials, participant questionnaires, one-on-one interviews, focus groups, and feedback on teaching. Group One data was analysed using comparative/descriptive analysis and reflexive thematic analysis was used for Group Two data. The methods were complementary to de/reconstruct data for comparability of features. NVivo software was employed to acquire results which are presented visually using tables and concept maps. The study identifies common content taught in stand-alone ESD courses and makes recommendations for course modelling based on Group One data contributions and what content Group Two say they like. The recommendations are presented as seven categories of consolidated curricular themes including science and sustainability based, contextually relevant, and futures hope. Consideration is given to student internal/external motivational domains and possible connection to curricular themes. Recommendations are practical and flexible, not prescriptive. The original contribution to knowledge lies in suggestions for ESD course content.

AB  - Communicating science effectively is an essential part of the development of science literacy. Research has shown that introducing primary scientific literature through journal clubs can improve student learning outcomes, including increased scientific knowledge. However, without scaffolding, students can miss more complex aspects of science literacy, including how to analyze and present scientific data. In this study, we apply a modified CREATE(S) process (Concept map the introduction, Read methods and results, Elucidate hypotheses, Analyze data, Think of the next Experiment, and Synthesis map) to improve students' science literacy skills, specifically their understanding of the process of science and their ability to use narrative synthesis to communicate science. We tested this hypothesis using a retrospective quasi-experimental study design in upper-division undergraduate courses. We compared learning outcomes for CREATES intervention students to those for students who took the same courses before CREATES was introduced. Rubric-guided, direct evidence assessments were used to measure student gains in learning outcomes. Analyses revealed that CREATES intervention students versus the comparison group demonstrated improved ability to interpret and communicate primary literature, especially in the methods, hypotheses, and narrative synthesis learning outcome categories. Through a mixed-methods analysis of a reflection assignment completed by the CREATES intervention group, students reported the synthesis map as the most frequently used step in the process and highly valuable to their learning. Taken together, the study demonstrates how this modified CREATES process can foster scientific literacy development and how it could be applied in science, technology, engineering, and math journal clubs.

AB  - Background: Concept maps and knowledge maps have been used to promote meaningful learning by students. The traditional pen-and-paper approach to such maps requires manual grading that generates a heavy workload for time-poor educators. Current computer-based tools are unable to provide reliable feedback in a user-friendly online environment.
   Summary of work: Our software, UNSW Knowledge Maps, is a cloud-based interactive knowledge mapping system. This system can be used to create, edit and share maps and students can receive automated graphical feedback in real-time. The system can be accessed without the installation of third party applications or plugins, increasing usability.
   Summary of results: Preliminary studies indicate a high uptake by students enrolled in the Medicine program and Medical Science courses. With one group of students, our data demonstrates a significantly higher perception of understanding after using the maps. A second group of students show improved learning outcomes in a pre-test post-test study.
   Discussion: The trials conducted thus far demonstrate that UNSW Knowledge Maps is a readily accepted tool for concept and knowledge mapping by students. The native web-based interface enhances usability by lowering the barriers for uptake. Initial studies suggest that UNSW Knowledge Maps provides benefits for learning by medical students.
   Conclusions: Our preliminary data suggests that UNSW Knowledge Maps is a readily accepted and useful educational tool. We have also developed an assessment mode in which teachers can create activities with automated grading and feedback. Take-home message: UNSW Knowledge Maps is an online educational tool that fosters engagement in meaningful learning, critical thinking, and problem solving skills. While still in its early stages, we believe this tool could prove valuable for students in a variety of disciplines.

KW  - SCALE
AB  - Introduction UK higher education (HE) student numbers are increasing and students report higher levels of mental health and well-being issues. Social prescribing links individuals to community-based, non-medical support. It is widely implemented throughout the UK, and is supported by the Welsh Government. This protocol presents an evaluation of a new social prescribing service to enhance student well-being, a first for UK HE students. Methods and analysis A realist evaluation to articulate why, how and to what extent and circumstances social prescribing works for students, using a mixed-methods sequential design of four cycles. Cycle 1 informs the model and programme theory development of how the model works; activities include a Realist Review, Group Concept Mapping and producing bilingual short films about the evaluation and model. Cycle 2 involves secondary analysis of routine service data, and outcome measurements from students receiving a social prescription. Cycle 3 uses reflective diaries and qualitative realist interviews with stakeholders to understand the process and outcome of the model. Cycle 4 concludes with a world cafe workshop with stakeholders to agree and finalise the framework specification of 'how, why, when and to what extent' the model works. A meta-matrix construction will determine convergence, complementarity or discrepancy across the cycles. An advisory group of key stakeholders informs each cycle. Ethics and dissemination University of South Wales Life Sciences and Education Ethics Committee and Wrexham Glyndwr University (WGU) Research Ethics Sub-Committee approved secondary data analysis of participant demographics (200 805LRL:USW, id441:WGU), outcome measurement tools (200 902LR:USW, id441:WGU) and qualitative data collection (200 804LR:USW, id449:WGU). The authors will publish findings in peer-reviewed journals, produce an evaluation report to the funder and a short film for dissemination via stakeholders, university networks, United Nations Regional Centre of Expertise in Wales, PRIME Centre Wales, Wales School for Social Prescribing Research, conferences and social media.

AB  - Background: Enhancing students' metacognitive abilities will help to facilitate their understanding of science concepts.Purpose: The study was designed to conduct and evaluate the effectiveness of a repertoire of interventions aimed at enhancing secondary school students' metacognitive capabilities and their achievements in science.Sample: A class of 35 Year 9 students participated in the study.Design and methods: The study involved a pre-post design, conducted by the first author as part of the regular designated science programme in a class taught by him.In order to enhance the students' metacognitive capabilities, the first author employed clearly stated focused outcomes, engaging them in collaborative group work, reading scientific texts and using concept mapping techniques during classroom instruction. The data to evaluate the effectiveness of the metacognitive interventions were obtained from pre- and post-test results of two metacognitive questionnaires, the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire (MSpQ) and the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire (MStQ), and data from interviews. In addition, pre-test and post-test scores were used from a two-tier multiple-choice test on Light.Results: The results showed gains in the MSpQ but not in the MStQ. However, the qualitative data from interviews suggested high metacognitive capabilities amongst the high- and average-achieving students at the end of the study. Students gains were also evident from the test scores in the Light test.Conclusion: Although the quantitative data obtained from the Metacognitive Strategies Questionnaire did not show significant gains in the students' metacognitive strategies, the qualitative data from interviews suggested positive perceptions of students' metacognitive strategies amongst the high- and average-achieving students. Data from the Metacognitive Support Questionnaire showed that there were significant gains in the students' perceptions of their metacognitive support implying that the majority of the students perceived that their learning environment was oriented towards the development of their metacognitive capabilities. The effect of the metacognitive interventions on students' achievement in the Light test resulted in students displaying the correct declarative knowledge, but quite often they lacked the procedural knowledge by failing to explain their answers correctly.

AB  - This study investigated the role of talk and writing on learning science. The purpose was to explore the effect of talk, writing, and talk and writing on the learning and retention of simple and integrated knowledge, and to describe the mechanisms by which talk and writing mediate these processes. Forty-three students were randomly assigned to four groups, all stratified for gender and ability. At intervals during an instructional unit, three treatment groups received problem tasks that involved constructing scientific explanations for real-world applications of ecological concepts. A control group received sim pier descriptive tasks based on similar content. Students in the talk-only treatment group (T) discussed the problem tasks in small peer groups. Students in the writing-only treatment group (W) individually wrote responses for each of the tasks, but without first talking to other students. Students in the combined talk and writing treatment group (TW) discussed the problems in groups prior to individually writing their explanations, Dependent variables included simple, integrated, and total knowledge scores based on multiple-choice tests, essay questions, and concept maps obtained at three timepoints during the study: a pretest; an immediate posttest; and a delayed posttest. Records of student talk and writing were also analyzed to describe the mechanisms involved. The findings suggest that talk is important for sharing, clarifying, and distributing knowledge among peers, while asking questions, hypothesizing, explaining, and formulating ideas together are all important mechanisms during peer discussions. Analytical writing is an important tool for transforming rudimentary ideas into knowledge that is more coherent and structured. Furthermore, talk combined with writing appears to enhance the retention of science learning over time, Moreover, gender and ability may be important mediating variables that determine the effectiveness of talk and writing for enhancing learning.

AB  - In this work we present some of our successes in combining MATLAB (R)-based simulation methods with Telecommunications Instructional Modeling (Emona-TIMS (TM)) experimental methods to enhance student learning in a senior-level communications systems laboratory. While faculty have discussed the relative merits of simulation versus real experimentation in recent years, we find that combining these approaches has multiple advantages: (1) A TIMS (TM) based approach (where we have chosen to use "real-world" demodulated audio from local radio stations as the local message signal) makes students feel that they are engaged in "real-world modulation/demodulation;" (2) The TIMS (TM) based approach inherently reinforces a "concept map" (block diagram) view of communications modulation and demodulation; (3) The MATLAB (R) simulation approach forces students to think about how to perform a proper simulation (e.g. set appropriate sampling rate, set appropriate specifications for digital filter design for envelope detector or discriminator, etc.) for both analog and digital simulation; and (4) The MATLAB (R) simulation approach sets a starting point for our students as they pursue software defined radio (SDR) communications applications in some of their senior design projects. We find synergy in combining the two pedagogical approaches in most of the labs in our communications systems course, and this typically results in enhanced student comprehension.
   While more formal assessment will be conducted over the next two years, at this point we know from course feedback that students very much appreciate both learning tools. Students commonly remark that the TIMS (TM) really highlights the "big picture," and helps them understand what to expect before they start the MATLAB (R) simulations, while coding up the MATLAB (R) simulations gets them "into the weeds," and gives them the tools to test out ideas that support their senior projects.

AB  - Introduction Health literacy research has focused predominantly on the adult population, and much less is understood about this concept from an adolescent perspective. The tools currently available to measure adolescent health literacy have been adapted from adult versions. This limits their applicability to young people because of the developmental characteristics that impact on adolescents' behaviour, including impulse control and judgement skills. This protocol describes the intended development and validity testing of a questionnaire to measure health literacy in adolescents. Methods and analysis This protocol describes this mixed methods study that has three phases: the first phase will involve grounded research with adolescents using qualitative group interviews, co-design and concept mapping workshops to understand what health and healthy behaviours mean to adolescents and to explore their health literacy needs and the potential domains for the questionnaire. The draft health literacy domains identified will be presented to the youth advisory panel, and the questionnaire will be altered based on their feedback. Cognitive pretesting of the questionnaire items will also be conducted. Phase 2 will involve piloting the questionnaire to a two-stage random sample of young people in five urban and rural schools in Ireland. Test-retest reliability will be conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis will also be conducted to analyse the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Phase 3 will involve the questionnaire being rolled out to a nationally representative sample of adolescents (n=6052) in Ireland to assess their levels of health literacy. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval to conduct this study has been granted from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee - Sciences (LS-20-08). Informed assent from adolescents and informed consent from parents/guardians will be sought. The findings of this research will be disseminated at national and international conferences, as well as through publication in peer-reviewed journals.

AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of instructional materials for the subject of classification of matter as solids, liquids and gases that were developed using a holistic instructional design model on student achievement. In the study a pre-test/post-test with control group experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the 2004-2005 school year using a sample of 120 students in the 7(th) grade (Experimental group 1=30, Experimental group 2=30, Control group 1=30, and Control group 2=30). At the beginning of the study a prior knowledge test, science attitude scale and Multiple Intelligence Fields Determination Scale were completed by the students. At the end of the study an achievement determination questionnaire was completed by the students in the experimental and control groups. Instructional material including student worksheets, student practice questions and a teacher guide were prepared by the researchers on the Freehand MXa program. In teaching the subject to the experimental groups, a holistic instructional approach was used that combined reliance on multiple intelligence theory, a constructivist approach, deliberate use of analogies and an emphasis on science process skills. In addition, concept maps and an animation were used. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Cohen's size effect, and the Scheffe Test with the SPSS 11.00 program at the .05 significance level. At the beginning of the study, it was found that while there was no statistically significant difference between the students of the experimental and control groups, at the end of the study levels of achievement of the students on this subject in the two experimental groups were higher than both control groups.

AB  - Background Ongoing developments in medical education recognize the move to curricula that support self-regulated learning processes, skills of thinking, and the ability to adapt and navigate uncertain situations as much as the knowledge base of learners. Difficulties encountered in pursuing this reform, especially for pharmacology, include the tendency of beginner learners not to ask higher-order questions and the potential incongruency between creating authentic spaces for self-directed learning and providing external expert guidance. We tested the feasibility of developing, implementing, and sustaining an innovative model of social pedagogy as a strategy to address these challenges. Methods Constructivism, communities of practice, and networked learning theory were selected as lenses for development of the model. Three hundred sixty-five first-year medical students participated between 2014 and 2018; they were introduced to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics via 15 online modules that each included: learning objectives, a clinical vignette, teaching video, cumulative concept map, and small group wiki assignment. Five-person communities organized around the 15 wiki assignments were a key component where learners answered asynchronous, case-based questions that touched iteratively on Bloom's cognitive taxonomy levels. The social pedagogy model's wiki assignments were explored using abductive qualitative data analysis. Results Qualitative analysis revealed that learners acquired and applied a conceptual framework for approaching pharmacology as a discipline, and demonstrated adaptive mastery by evaluating and interacting competently with unfamiliar drug information. Learners and faculty acquired habits of self-directed assessment seeking and learner-centered coaching, respectively; specifically, the model taught learners to look outward to peers, faculty, and external sources of information for credible and constructive feedback, and that this feedback could be trusted as a basis to direct performance improvement. 82-94% of learners rated the social pedagogy-based curriculum valuable. Conclusions This social pedagogy model is agnostic with regard to pharmacology and type of health professional learner; therefore, we anticipate its benefits to be transferable to other disciplines.

TI  - Evaluating the Impact of a Comprehensive Canadian Science-Art Residency Program on the Participating Scientist, Artist and the Public

AB  - Science-art residencies can provide opportunities for insightful cross-disciplinary collaborations, science communication, and engagement with the general public. Currently, there are few formal ways for artists and scientists to collaborate in Canada, and even fewer publications on how these experiences can impact learning in informal settings. Art the Science (a Canadian non-profit organization facilitating cross-disciplinary relationships between artists and scientists) piloted a comprehensive multiphase science-art residency program. Phase 1 informed the artist's work through a full-time experience in a scientific laboratory at an academic institution, Phase 2 showcased the artist's final artwork, Between the Sand at an off-campus local community event, and Phase 3 published an interactive online version of the work for global exhibition. Residency evaluation in each phase was conducted through the use of qualitative and quantitative methods, including interviews, concept mapping, video diaries, and surveys. The artist, scientist and lab members gained new perspectives and inspiration about their respective fields. The artist was able to incorporate theories and processes from the research group into their artistic practice. On the other hand, the scientist saw renewed enthusiasm and curiosity within their research lab, and the lab members reported new ways of thinking about how to communicate their research. Both exhibitions proved to be engaging informal learning experiences for 66.2% of survey participants, and revealed several major learning themes. Despite promoting both events as artwork exhibitions, 79.2% of survey participants considered Between the Sand as both an artwork and a science communication product suggesting that science-based art may have the potential to communicate science, even when it is not presented as a science communication effort. Public responses revealed that public perception of funding is not skewed to either discipline and instead seems to call upon both science and arts grants to fund such interdisciplinary initiatives. Providing comprehensive artist residencies in science labs may have a valuable impact on everyone involved: the artist, the research group, and the public.

AB  - Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) are pivotal actors in international affairs. They manage billions of dollars in funding, work all around the world, and shape global policies and standards. It thus comes as no surprise that the subject of accountability has drawn the interest of an increasing number of scholars across disciplines. Though there seems to be agreement about its desirability, accountability is also described as chameleon-like and ambiguous. And despite calls for more cross-disciplinary learning and conceptual clarity, there does not exist a comprehensive review of accountability conceptualizations across and within disciplines, or how the different meanings relate to each other. Based on the conceptual review of 217 research articles published within the last twenty years, this study identifies and analyzes conceptualizations of accountability in the major journals of five engaged disciplines: accounting, development studies, international relations and political science, organization studies and management, and public administration. Integrating this broad scholarship reveals that: (1) there exist 113 different conceptualizations of accountability, 90 of which are rarely used and appear in less than 5 percent of all analyzed articles, (2) scholars have used forty-three different conceptualizations in 2019 compared to seventeen conceptualizations in 2009, (3) many conceptualizations refer to same phenomena by different name (duplication), and different phenomena by the same name (conflict), and that (4) conceptual ambiguity contributes to ambiguity among the forty different terms used to measure and operationalize accountability. These findings illustrate a lack of cross-disciplinary learning and accumulation of knowledge, and suggest that new conceptualizations be introduced only if one or more of the 113 existing ones don't already capture an idea sufficiently. The purpose of this article is to serve as a concept map for scholars when debating and charting new directions for the study of accountability.

AB  - Background The goal of this research was to determine students' perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students' developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students' perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved. Results Outcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students' perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students' science learning. Conclusions Creating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students' learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students' perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

AB  - This research investigated the potentials and the boundaries regarding the use of Conceptual Maps (CM) as metacognitive tools for teaching and learning the History of Chemistry (HQ). Therefore, a proposal for the collaborative development of MC was elaborated on previously determined themes of the History of Chemistry, to compare the MC when prepared manually (analog mode) and when constructed with the aid of the CmapTools (R) software (digital mode). Based on the design of the proposal used in this study, a specific model for the use of CM in the classroom in a collaborative way was formulated. A qualitative-quantitative methodology was used, which was essential to validate the different phases of the research process, such as data collection, analysis and presentation. The findings in the light of metacognition point out that there are nuances between the construction of analog and digital CM, which can modify the structure of individuals' conceptual knowledge.

AB  - Despite many efforts from both industry and academia to prepare students for professional practice, the disconnect between what industry would like students to know and the quality and adequacy of the skills with which students graduate still remains. In an attempt to address this disparity, a flipped classroom approach and a strong liaison with an industry partner have been implemented in two consecutive second year Information Systems courses since 2013. A design science methodology, implemented through a theory of coherent practice, was used to guide the design of the curriculum for this approach. As part of the evaluation of this approach, each course was executed as an action experiment. A set of carefully designed interventions to foster an interactive and integrated pedagogy, where students actively participated in their own learning, constituted the elements of these experiments. Interventions, such as quizzes, exercises, discussions, polls, projects and more, were structured to ensure that students experience the three learning stages of knowing, understanding and applying. It was a dynamic and ongoing process of fusing practical experience with theoretical concepts. It further helped to determine what level of competency students have reached and guided their growth to the next level through enhanced skills, experience and deep approaches to learning as well as through changes in attitude. An additional advantage was that students already started to prepare for their careers during the early stages of their studies. The paper will report on the outcomes of the four specific action experiments and the rationale behind their design. Concept maps were used to evaluate the feedback from these experiments, illustrating the benefits and the limitations in each one of the three learning phases. The reflections on and lessons learnt from each action experiment helped to conceptualise new interventions and adapt existing ones. The nature of the involvement of the industry partner will also be highlighted and further improvements will be proposed.

AB  - Innovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for crosscurricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.

AB  - Many higher education faculty members find themselves with the opportunity or requirement to design a new course, or to redesign existing courses or programs. In such situations they have a number of options for how to proceed, but may be unaware of these options. And despite the recommendations and examples provided by organizations such as the Mathematical Association of America, we lack objective guidelines for making curricular decisions and for evaluating potential curricular changes. Additional complications are encountered in the hard sciences, where evaluation of hypotheses typically occurs only after rigorous experimentation. With many curriculum experiments resulting in ambiguous or anecdotal data or lacking data whatsoever, we are faced with making decisions under a great deal of uncertainty. In this chapter, we will discuss five models for curriculum development that are founded on different concepts of the learning experience. Each is unique in its approach and each pairs with different types of learning goals and objectives. Like all curriculum models, these are an attempt to share with students some underlying knowledge structure, a structure that is essentially a mathematical object known as a graph or network. They can be generated through a kind of mind map or concept map and possess complex inter-relations among the components which often require a three-dimensional model to fully visualize. To construct any curriculum then requires that we take this complex structure in three spatial dimensions and project it into a single temporal dimension so that students can experience the curriculum over time. This projection is not unique, except for the simplest of knowledge structures. Thus, all decisions about curriculum development become equivalent to a single geometric question: How do we choose the best projection from which to view the curriculum? An alternative approach, the one taken in this chapter, is to go beyond a fixed curriculum or static projection to expose students to a hyperlinked curriculum. Rather than hiding the complexity of knowledge and its connections to the students, the hyperlinked curriculum is generated by students under the constraints, guidance, and support of teachers and in collaboration with others. These teachers are in turn supported by each other, linked together by administrators who seek to guarantee appropriate opportunities for all learners.

AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n=245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert's referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners' productions.

AB  - Concept browsing interfaces can help educators and learners to locate and use learning resources that are aligned with recognized learning goals. The Strand Map Service enables users to navigate interactive visualizations of related learning goals and to request digital library resources aligned with learning goals. These interfaces are created using a programmatic Web service interface that dynamically generates interactive visual components. Preliminary findings suggest that these library interfaces appear to help users stay focused on the scientific content of their information discovery task, as opposed to focusing on the mechanics of searching.

AB  - We introduce mindset streams for assessing ways of bridging two target concepts in concept maps. We focus on behavioural forma mentis networks (BFMN), which map the associative and affective dimensions of memory recalls. Inspired by trains of thoughts taking several paths to link ideas, mindset streams are defined as BFMN subgraphs induced by all shortest paths between two target concepts, e.g. all recalls in shortest paths bridging ''math'' and ''learning''. These streams quantify the following features of the mindset encoded in a BFMN: (i) semantic content (i.e. which ideas mediate connections between targets?), (ii) valence coherence/conflict (i.e. are connections mediated by entwining ideas perceived negatively, positively or neutrally?), and (iii) semantic relevance (i.e. are the bridges between targets peripheral or central for the connectivity/betweenness of the BFMN?). We investigate mindset streams between 'maths''/''physics'' and key motivational aspects of learning (''fun'', ''work'', ''failure'') in two BFMNs, encoding how 159 students and 59 experts perceived and associated concepts about Science Technology Engineering and Maths (STEM), respectively. Statistical comparisons against configuration models show that high schoolers bridge ''maths'' and ''fun'' only through overabundant levels of valence-conflicting associations, contrasting negatively perceived domain knowledge with peer-related positive experiences. This conflict is absent in the researchers' mindset stream, which rather bridges ''math'' and ''fun'' through positive, science-related associations. The mindset streams of both groups bridge ''maths'' and ''physics'' to ''work'' through mostly positive career-related jargon. Students' mindset streams of ''failure'' and ''math''/''physics'' are dominated by negative associations with test anxiety, whereas researchers integrate ''failure'' and ''math''/''physics'' in semantically richer and more positive contexts, denoting failure itself as a cornerstone of STEM learning. We discuss our findings and future research directions in view of relevant psychology/education literature.& COPY; 2023 The Author(s). Published by Elsevier B.V.

TI  - Using Innovative Topics to Attract Future Engineers: Liquefaction and Sustainability Modules for Engineering Camp
T2  - 2013 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE
CP  - ASEE Annual Conference
AB  - Efforts to attract quality and diverse students into civil engineering have given rise to engineering camps aimed at secondary school students. Innovative topics such as soil liquefaction and sustainability are typically studied in depth within civil engineering graduate programs. However, worldwide attention to these topics has been generated throughout society through recent natural events such as the earthquake in New Zealand and storm surge effects in New York and New Orleans, along with the on-going issue of global warming. These phenomena have been connected in a way to begin educating secondary school students, while simultaneously encouraging an interest in engineering. This connection was accomplished through the development and implementation of two teaching modules, targeting 13 to 16 year old students. The soil liquefaction module is aimed at familiarizing students with the term as well as fundamental engineering concepts related to the topic. Experiments were conducted both on a small-scale shake table available at select universities and a widely available teaching device for fluidized beds. Students took various measurements and made calculations of soil density before and after liquefaction. For the sustainability module, the students were introduced to key concepts related to environmental, social, and economic sustainability. Two activities were implemented with regards to ecological footprint and green building. Students calculated their ecological footprint based on a survey of lifestyle-related questions and compared their impacts to average values in developing countries. In addition, they completed a case study assessment of exemplary green buildings and developed a concept map depicting the project's applicability to the triple bottom line goals. To simplify the task of implementing the modules, detailed procedures for the experiments and activities, along with worksheets for the students have been developed for interested instructors. The modules have been tested at Bucknell University during the summers of 2011 and 2012, and survey assessment results from student evaluation confirm that the modules are effective in meeting the defined objectives of each topic. The overall goal of the assessment was to establish student learning in the modules.

AB  - Disciplinary boundaries become increasingly unclear when grappling with "wicked problems,"which present a complex set of policy, cultural, technological, and scientific dimensions. "T-shaped" professionals, i.e. individuals with a depth and breadth of expertise, are being called upon to play a critical role in complex problem-solving. This paper unpacks the notion of the "T-shaped expert" and seeks to situate it within the broader academic literature on expertise, integration, and developmental learning. A component of this project includes an exploratory study, which is aimed at evaluating the emergent attributes of T-shaped expertise in two different educational programs completed between January and May in 2015. The two programs build disciplinary knowledge in science, technology engineering, and mathematics fields at the core (vertical dimension), while expanding the students' awareness and comprehension of other expertise (horizontal dimension). The courses introduced science and engineering students to case study topics focusing around complex human-technological-ecological systems in a nanotechnology and society course; and the governance of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in a science, technology, and society course. We analyze pre- and post-test data from this pilot project before presenting findings that pertain to student learning, as well as variants in the methodology and reflect on the utility (and limitations) of the selected methodology for evaluating expertise as it evolves over time. The paper closes with a discussion of a theory of acquisition with implications for delineating early attributes and characteristics of T-shaped expertise.

AB  - We live today a paradigm crisis in the sciences and to see that slowly take over our education. This crisis came to disturb us in the sense we see the world, science, experience and especially education. Usually she showed us how much we reduce the reality, cognition, and the worst of it is that dissecting the human body in parts without even a trace of life. In this issue authors as Moscovici, Merleau-Ponty (1999), and Moreira Capra went to great pains to understand the parts from the whole and the whole from the parts in a complex and systemic movement. Showed how classical science limited explanations of living systems because they are living present complexities. Identified conceptual obstacles and learning that was attributed to: the body, human motion, ie, the human movement.

AB  - The consideration of threshold concepts is offered in the context of biological education as a theoretical framework that may have utility in the teaching and learning of biology at all levels. Threshold concepts may provide a mechanism to explain the observed punctuated nature of conceptual change. This perspective raises the profile of periods of conceptual stasis from 'failure to learn' to necessary periods within the normal pattern of student learning. Threshold concepts are seen as points where segmental/linear knowledge structures and cumulative/hierarchical knowledge structures are integrated, resulting in a transformation in understanding. 'Evolution' and `dynamic transformation' are nominated as candidate threshold concepts within biology

AB  - As Medina (2008) points out, contrary to the belief that the role of the teacher in participatory methodologies is mainly passive, it should instead focus on fostering reflexive group processes through strategies that make the task easier for future teachers to use their own beliefs as the object of analysis. In this vein, Delgado (1991) states that the role of the teacher in those classes where the main aim is to foster active participation in the teaching and learning process is that of promoting activities where debate, criticism or cooperation are stimulated, topics of social interest to do with the surroundings are incorporated, and the group is provided with clear preliminary information concerning what they will be dealing with, offering guidelines for the tasks to be done in groups and helping to solve doubts. The methodological strategies which have been developed throughout the classes, both theoretical and practical, are the following: mentored tasks, debates, group discussions, oral presentations delivered by the students, master classes, design of concept maps in groups, and learning through research.
   In this work we present self-assessments handed in by students as they carried out both autonomous and mentored tasks in groups, and the relationship between their learning experiences and the degree of acquisition of general competences. A total of 40 third -and fourth-year students of the Degree in Physical Activity and Sport Science have taken part. Assessment was grouped in four sections: learning self-perception, group dynamics, teaching methodology and competences acquired. A correlation analysis was applied to the variables of student self-assessment and the degree of acquisition of competences with the tasks. Learning self-perception variables show a significant correlation with competences such as the capacity to work on a team, learning to learn, creativity and excellence. As regards group dynamics, a significant correlation is attested for the competence of teamwork.

AB  - Introduction: Medical education today, encourages modification of traditional didactic lectures with innovations to promote active learning strategies to enhance integration of knowledge and critical thinking skills among students. Learning independently is challenging in year 1 of the undergraduate medical curriculum. However, defining the learning goals clearly by the instructor to the students will make them appreciate it and mould them into successful learners with deep approach.
   Aim: To enhance self-directed learning skills and to promote concept mapping ability to integrate the study of various metabolic functions and fundamental concepts in biochemistry.
   Materials and Methods: First year MBBS Student volunteers (n=127) in their second semester having an experience of over 30 weeks of learning biochemistry in an integrated system-wise approach were involved in this study. They were exposed to a self-directed active learning strategy for a period of 10 weeks, for linking important biochemical terms from the current learning objectives to various concepts and topics learnt earlier in the year. Student's perspective regarding the above activity was documented by obtaining their responses in a closed ended questionnaire using Likert scale and was expressed as percentage.
   Results: Majority of the students (n=100, 79%) opined that it was a unique way of learning biochemistry and that they (n=111, 87%) were required to read up previous portions. Many students (n=100, 79%) felt that it made them more than mere rote learners and were able to integrate biochemistry topics more efficiently (n=109, 86%). Many students also felt that it helped them to improve their test scores (n=79, 62%).
   Conclusion: Active participation in the current study has made them learn the concept building skills in biochemistry and has proved to be an effective exercise of revisit to topics learnt throughout the year. Innovative curriculum delivery strategies should be designed to teach preclinical subjects in a medical school so that they shall infuse integrated learning approach in students. Concept building activities in a lecture set up shall generate curiosity in the process of learning and transform students into deep approach learners.

AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate and report on the impact of an in-school science outreach program on children's self-reported science knowledge, engagement, and skills through a case study of the Science North in-school outreach program "Mission to Mars." A logic model method was used to outline the specific inputs, outputs, and measurable outcomes of the program. The program outcomes evaluated in this study were (1) experimentation skills, (2) critical thinking skills, and (3) sense of wonder. Results from pre-post surveys demonstrated that participants had increased program topic knowledge. Students self-reported positive emotions toward science more frequently following exposure to the program. Students' sense of wonder toward science and toward space also increased post-program. This increase in positive emotion toward science could, in the short-term, increase student motivation toward science, which could lead to lasting interests in science in the long-term. Only a small number of students reported an increase in experimentation and critical thinking skills post-program. These skills take time to develop, and the single short-term program evaluated in this study may not have given students enough exposure to these skills for them to experience and show a noticeable change. The results of this study can provide informal science institutions like science centers with important insights into the potential learning impact of their in-school outreach programs, and can be used to improve current and future programs. Other organizations with in-school science outreach programs can benefit from using the methodology in this study to evaluate their programs, as this research includes a combination of innovative data collection methods such as concept maps to determine what students associate with the word "science," and the use of an emoji scale to capture student emotions toward science. From a larger perspective, this study evaluating the impacts of in-school science outreach could demonstrate the potential benefits and outcomes of this unique area of informal learning, further solidifying the importance of incorporating these inquiry-based programs into classrooms.

AB  - The aim of the project is to support the use of technology to encourage the study of science and above all to do research on life in space; it is an opportunity to discover the students' predisposition towards the study of scientific subjects. The project starts from the interest shown by the students in the projects proposed by ASI (Italian Space Agency).
   Direct communication through social networks with astronauts, videos published by NASA, the ESA twitter profile, the Scientix community website, have supported the participation in competitions for young students of the Aerospace Technology District. The teacher can explain to students how to choose their own sources of information, how to share information and emotions and be creative on the web.
   The training and technological path not only leads to the creation of a new way of storing experiences, but constitutes a cultural heritage available to the student and his/her companions, to be subsequently resumed, revised, modified and eventually improved. The project includes two lines of activity: one oriented to the goal of sensitizing students to the conscious use of tools for educational purposes; a second one oriented to the production and sharing of works realized by the study of experiences focused on space and technology, reported on the websites of the ESA (European Space Agency) and the ASI (Italian Space Agency).
   The main phases of the project are basically four: to identify a theme related to life in space, to have an idea and communicate it through posters, web portals, social networks; identify the web tools to create participated activities and stimulate the interest of the students; share the product material; return of the material collected in a narrative and engaging form.
   The most modern active teaching techniques are used to stimulate the participants in group work and to understand the problem solving method. The theme chosen, developed by the students and shared on social media is hydroponic vegetation in space. Participant students were aged 14-16, and data was collated through teacher's interviews, classroom observations, students' diaries and concept maps.

AB  - This article describes a basic development model for an intelligent tutoring system (ITS): the interface, the student model, the expert model, and the pedagogical model. Because ITSs are a byproduct of research in cognitive science, we use this model to illustrate the possibilities for more extensive integration of cognitive learning theories into computer-based instruction (CBI). Two examples of CBI designed from this perspective are included to illustrate the possibilities of the model and to suggest that the dichotomy between CBI and ITSs need not be perpetuated.

AB  - In this study, we explore die use of expert-designed structure maps by students in an algebra-based physics course and the evolution of these maps based upon students' reactions and feedback collected over one semester. The participants were trained to use structure maps while solving problems sharing similar deep-structure elements. They met for one hour every week to work on the problems using the maps. We report here on the ways in which students used the structure maps during the interviews, the difficulties faced by students as they attempted to use these maps as well as die feedback offered by students regarding die maps. We also report on how we changed die maps based on feedback from the students and to facilitate their Use during problem solving.

AB  - Both, teachers and researchers, agree that in order to teach related content to science with high quality, is necessary in advance have not only a proper understanding of science content, but of the nature of science too, so the initial teacher training should address this issue explicitly. In this paper we present and analyze the implementation of a teaching and learning sequence in a preservice teachers class, which it allows us to see, through models produced successively by the participants, how progress the ideas regarding one of the questions that the nature of scientific knowledge must deal: how this knowledge is constructed. It became evident the overcoming of several obstacles that create a false image of science. The results show how the progression of students' ideas in this domain entails overcoming several obstacles that create a wrong image of science, such as the empiricist idea, individualistic, absolutist or others, favoring to build a set of ideas closer to the desirables.

AB  - Currently, the world needs health-literate citizens who are able to make informed decisions about COVID-19 and other diseases. Here, we propose a COVID-19 roadmap consisting of four commented maps about infection, diagnosis, defense, treatment, and prevention. We built the maps based on those from the Atlas of Science Literacy following a qualitative methodology. Main ideas about health linked to COVID-19 and how they relate to each other can be visualized in the maps in an organized structure and according to K-levels. The maps are accompanied by a text that relates the health ideas to the COVID-19 disease. This tool can be used to promote health education and, ultimately, health literacy through the teaching and learning of COVID-19.

AB  - One of the critical aspects of building intelligent tutoring systems regards proper monitoring of student's activity and academic performance. This paper presents a continuous student knowledge tracing method implemented for Tesys e-Learning platform at the Faculty of Automation, Computers and Electronics in the University of Craiova. The student's knowledge level is continuously monitored and, after each recommended test by the SVD-based mechanism, a new set of knowledge weights are computed. We aim to achieve a comprehensive monitoring environment which can provide an accurate insight upon the student's knowledge level at any moment. In our approach, we added weights for both students and tests to improve the student's evolution monitoring and provide more accurate feedback. The setup for validation consisted of ten tests with eight questions per test and we used both current and past year tests data. Results revealed that assigning weights to questions, tests and students and using them in the recommendation process offers a better view of the student's evolution along with more accurate recommendations. Progress in this direction will provide more insight into available teaching materials and SVD-based recommender system such that the e-learning platform that integrates the presented mechanism will provide a better learning experience.

AB  - Environmental sustainability is important to public health and of particular significance considering the rapidly growing ageing population. While advancement in chemical science has contributed to enhanced quality of life, increasing levels of chemical pollutions and the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment have led to serious concern. The deterioration of environmental quality has been largely due to chemical pollution and the elderly group in the population are more susceptible to the hazardous effects of industrial chemicals and airborne pollutants. This situation also presents uphill challenges to the promotion of healthy ageing which requires a sustainable clean environment contributed through the advancement of sustainable and green chemistry. However, innovations in green chemistry require a systems thinking mindset which is also important in realizing the impact of chemicals on human health and the environment. The adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by the United Nations has called for immediate actions in adopting the SDGs as a central concern in the reform of different domains for the invention of a sustainable future. The practice of chemistry has various impacts on many interconnected systems, re-orientation of chemistry education has been proposed with the implementation of inter-disciplinaryapproaches as informed by systems thinking, with a growing number of reports suggesting its potentials and applications in chemical education. Despite the vast opinions suggesting the promising prospects of applying systems thinking in education, reports on the development of relevant tools and educational resources are only of a limited amount, with recent perspectives identifying the design of educational tools and resources as one of the priority areas. In this study, we report the collaborative work across the disciplines of health and chemical sciences in the pedagogic design of incorporating systems thinking in chemistry education adopting the theoretical framework. The design of a system-oriented concept map extension (SOCME) diagram is described, with reference to a case study of chemicals released from the degradation of plastics. The work presented illustrates the potential of systems thinking in sustainable education and adds to the collections of educational resources for incorporation of systems thinking in teaching and learning.

AB  - Knowledge of key variables driving the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance over a vegetated surface is an important step to derive biophysical variables from TOA radiance data, e.g., as observed by an optical satellite. Coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) allow linking vegetation variables directly to the at-sensor TOA radiance measured. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of RTMs enables the computation of the total contribution of each input variable to the output variance. We determined the impacts of the leaf-canopy-atmosphere variables into TOA radiance using the GSA to gain insights into retrievable variables. The leaf and canopy RTM PROSAIL was coupled with the atmospheric RTM MODTRAN5. Because of MODTRAN's computational burden and GSA's demand for many simulations, we first developed a surrogate statistical learning model, i.e., an emulator, that allows approximating RTM outputs through a machine learning algorithm with low computation time. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) emulator was used to reproduce lookup tables of TOA radiance as a function of 12 input variables with relative errors of 2.4%. GSA total sensitivity results quantified the driving variables of emulated TOA radiance along the 400-2500 nm spectral range at 15 cm-1 (between 0.3-9 nm); overall, the vegetation variables play a more dominant role than atmospheric variables. This suggests the possibility to retrieve biophysical variables directly from at-sensor TOA radiance data. Particularly promising are leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water thickness and leaf area index, as these variables are the most important drivers in governing TOA radiance outside the water absorption regions. A software framework was developed to facilitate the development of retrieval models from at-sensor TOA radiance data. As a proof of concept, maps of these biophysical variables have been generated for both TOA (L1C) and bottom-of-atmosphere (L2A) Sentinel-2 data by means of a hybrid retrieval scheme, i.e., training GPR retrieval algorithms using the RTM simulations. Obtained maps from L1C vs L2A data are consistent, suggesting that vegetation properties can be directly retrieved from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of an atmospheric correction.

AB  - The development of teaching in higher education towards a more learnerorientated model has been supported by the literature on individual learning differences and on learning styles in particular. This has contributed to the evolution of university pedagogy away from a medieval transmission model than runs counter to contemporary understanding of learning. However, rather than solving problems of classroom practice, recognition of student learning differences has amplified a number of tensions within the system that have not been adequately resolved in practical terms for academic staff. Such tensions complicate the professional lives of university teachers and as a consequence may lead to cycles of non- learning as teachers retreat towards the familiar transmission of content. A reconceptualisationof university pedagogy towards an expertise model allows the variation between complementary chains of practice and networks of understanding to be exploited as a positive characteristic of the learning experience.

AB  - Mastering complex biochemistry pathways and physiological processes can be challenging for undergraduate medical students. Although drawing out the conceptual relationships in complex information can potentially support student learning, there is a lack of consensus in current literature regarding optimal strategies that effectively integrate drawing into teaching. In this paper, we report our experience incorporating drawing in multiple approaches during the delivery of first-year pre-clerkship biochemistry and physiology instructional sessions. Students' perception of and experience with these different strategies were compared. Themes that emerged from learner feedback and their implications for future practice and research are presented.

AB  - Background: Despite a high rate of bicycle ownership, the prevalence of cycling to school among children and adolescents in Germany has been constantly low. Cycling to school can contribute to meeting the physical activity recommendations, which the majority of children and adolescents in Germany do not meet.
   Methods: By using intervention mapping, this study protocol describes the systematic planning process of a school-based intervention in Germany aimed to increase the number of days on which students cycle to school and to increase their physical activity levels. To make sure that the intervention will match the needs of students, we conducted a concept mapping study investigating what students need to cycle to school, as perceived by students, parents, and teachers. The logic model of change was based on an integration of the self-determination theory and the social-ecological model. We structured our intervention as two phases, a preparatory phase with weekly components for and a practical phase with a daily repeated component of the targeted behavior. In the 8-week preparatory phase, teachers, parents, and peers will be involved. The content of the 12-week practical phase will involve peers only and was considered promising based on the findings from a systematic review that we conducted to identify the effective strategies of school-based interventions to promote cycling to school among children and adolescents. Overall, our intervention includes 27 behavior change techniques. A researcher, student assistants, teachers, and other collaborators will implement the intervention; a whole-of-school approach with components performed before, during, and after school was chosen. As a study design, we decided to draft a two-arm three-level cluster randomized controlled trial. Both the effect and process evaluation were prepared. In the first instance, approximately 250 students of 12-15 years of age from grade 7 or 8, who attend a secondary school of intermediate or high educational level located in (sub)urban regions in Southern Germany, will pilot the intervention.
   Discussion: We expect to provide an effective and sustainable intervention for students, which gives insights into the mechanisms of change concerning the behavior of cycling to school and its influence on physical activity levels.

AB  - This study investigates to what extent collaborative knowledge construction can be fostered by providing students with visualization tools as structural support. Students (32) of Educational Psychology took part in the study. The students were subdivided into dyads and asked to solve a case problem of their learning domain under one of two conditions: (1) with content-specific visualization (2) with content-unspecific visualization. Results show that by being provided with a content-specific visualization tool, both the process and the outcome of the cooperative effort improved. More specifically, dyads under that condition referred to more adequate concepts, risked more conflicts, and were more successful in integrating prior knowledge into the collaborative solution. Moreover, those learning partners had a more similar individual learning outcome. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The teaching/learning interview has been used to investigate student learning. The aim of the teaching/learning interview is to model a natural learning environment while allowing more direct access to a student's or group's thinking and reasoning. The interview typically involves one to four students working with a researcher/interviewer while being audio and video recorded. It has previously been reported [1] that the data collected in a teaching/learning interview is richer in detail than data collected in an actual classroom. We investigated the possibility that there were also other differences between these formats. We used the same instructional materials as well as pre-, mid- and post-tests in a teaching/learning interview and in a classroom laboratory setting. We will describe how the data collected in these two settings compare.

AB  - Pedagogic frailty has been proposed as a unifying concept that may help to integrate institutional efforts to enhance teaching within universities by helping to maintain a simultaneous focus on key areas that are thought to impede the development of pedagogy. These areas and the links that have been proposed to connect them are interrogated here through the analysis of an autoethnographic narrative produced by a community insider who has considerable experience of teaching and researching geography. This person-centred methodology acknowledges the subjective nature of teaching, gives voice to important stories that might not otherwise be heard formally and provides a case study that can been used as an exemplar to promote institutional dialogue about quality enhancement and the student experience. The findings from this case study suggest that colleagues may be able to repurpose disciplinary concepts to help make sense of the learning and teaching discourse.

AB  - This paper puts forth a vision and an architecture for a community knowledge evolution system. We propose augmenting a multimedia document repository (digital library) with innovative knowledge evolution support, including computer-mediated communications, community process support, decision support, advanced hypermedia features, and conceptual knowledge structures. These tools, and the techniques developed around them, would enable members of a virtual community to learn from, contribute to, and collectively build upon the community's knowledge and improve many member tasks. The resulting Collaborative Knowledge Evolution Support System (CKESS) would provide an enhanced digital library infrastructure serving as an ever-evolving repository of the community's knowledge, which members would actively use in everyday tasks and regularly update.

AB  - Castro Carazo University has adopted an educational model of ecoformation since 2016. It has been necessary to incorporate good practices and strategies of pedagogical and curricular innovation, as an integral part of its educational and administrative processes. This article details the most relevant practices and strategies: the design and implementation of a university teaching program for faculty, the inauguration of a learning laboratory for the promotion of learning through digital fabrication, and the strengthening of a Curricular Innovation team. These disruptive processes have changed the teacher-student dynamics, by promoting a dialogue of knowledge through physical and virtual spaces, where error is part of learning, and where the ecology of knowledge becomes the basis of learning.

AB  - This review provides a summary of distinct Hamiltonians used to describe magnetic and spectroscopic properties of paramagnetic and magnetic coordination compounds. Based on the origins and the underlying physical principles, clear recommendations are formulated on when these Hamiltonians are appropriate and how they relate to each other. The interface, denoted CF (LF) <-> SH (ZFS), encompasses the physical Hamiltonians, which include the crystal field (CF) [or equivalently ligand field (LF)] Hamiltonians, and the effective spin Hamiltonians (SH), which include the zero-field splitting (ZFS) Hamiltonians, as well as, to a certain extent, also the notion of magnetic anisotropy (MA). Survey of recent literature has revealed that the intricate web of interrelated notions has become dangerously entangled over the years. A given crucial notion is often referred to by one of the three names that are not synonymous: CF (LF), SH (ZFS), or MA, each having a well-defined and established meaning in optical spectroscopy, electron magnetic resonance (EMR), and magnetism, respectively. The terminological confusions occurring in literature call for in-depth clarifications, which are provided in this review. For this purpose, crucial notions are systematically defined and their logical interrelationships illustrated by concept maps. The operator types used to express the CF (LF) and SH (ZFS) Hamiltonians, i.e. the Stevens and Wybourne ones, are classified and their distinct properties discussed. Several key aspects are considered in the nutshell: basic forms of Hamiltonians and definitions of the associated parameters, distinct properties of the Stevens and Wybourne CF (LF) parameters and implications for conversion relations, distinctions and interrelationships between the CF (LF) and SH (ZFS) Hamiltonians or parameters, conversion relations between the Stevens ZFS parameters and conventional ones. The general focus is on the fundamental aspects underlying physics and chemistry of single transition (4f(N) and 3d(N)) ions in coordination compounds as well as the novel single-ion and polynuclear magnetic systems. This includes the single-ion magnets and the exchange coupled systems (ECS) based on transition ions, especially the single molecule magnets (SMM) or molecular nanomagnets (MNM). The general aim is to provide deeper understanding of the major intricacies involved in the CF (LF) <-> SH (ZFS) interface. The level of presentation is geared toward experimentalists with background in chemistry or physics. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB  - The possibilities of students learning ecology by means of developing projects based on ecological observations and experiments in nature were studied. The constructivists' concepts were analyzed as well as the criticism of their opponents in order to determine the theoretical framework of the teaching model. The achievements of students in two variations of teaching were compared: Experimental (E)-team work in doing chemical, physical and biological experiments in the ecosystems, analyzing and presenting data with the aid of ICT at a school conference; Control teaching (K) - visualized with the aid of ICT lectures, delivered by the teacher, construction of conceptual maps by students. Special attention was paid on discovering and solving environmental problems. Student's achievements were evaluated by means of tests for knowledge, diagnostic observations for skills and questionnaire for attitude towards the new ecological paradigm.

AB  - A broad consensus exists on the use of cooperative action research as a suitable form of reflection to optimise the teaching-learning process. It is therefore appropriate that future secondary level teachers should know about this methodology as a means to professionalisation. So, is it enough to know of a method? According to our view of training, praxis must be consistent with the aims pursued and consequently the method must be experienced, particularly in an age when there is evidence that points to the need for cooperative work and skills training.
   In accordance with this theoretical framework, a professionalising training action is described from the Master's Degree in Secondary Education Teacher Training (MUFPES) course at the University of Extremadura during 2016-2017. The subject of study was the concept of "Science" in secondary level school students and the use of cooperative action research; we try to encourage the development of attitudes that favour investigation, reflection and educational innovation through the study of real cases. The MUFPES students began their experience by reflecting on their own ideas about the nature of science, the meaning of scientific in today's society, and the scientific themes or content that are relevant to society and for obtaining scientific information. Subsequently, the investigation process started with a discussion on the problems of students in compulsory education who "don not want to learn" and their motivation with regard to science. The groups selected to apply the method were students from Years 1 and 3 of compulsory secondary education; the initial diagnostic tool used was an open questionnaire, together with an analysis of concept maps made by secondary level students and a multiple choice questionnaire using the INFLESZ scale to evaluate and validate the readability of the statements and options. Following analysis and interpretation of the qualitative and quantitative data an action plan was designed based on the incorporation of sequenced tasks through a taxonomy focused on thought models, and with these to develop key competences. The title of the proposed plan was "My programme and documentary schedule, and selection of my favourite science magazines". Regarding the latter, we present a selection of the activities developed by the Master's students so that secondary level students can work using a way of thinking that is reflective, analytical, logical, critical, systemic, analogical, creative, deliberative and practical. Finally, the students' evaluation of the process is reviewed and the results of the survey on the students' satisfaction are provided.

AB  - Engineering degree students sometimes feel that programming courses are not particularly relevant to their main subject and consequently are unmotivated and underperform. In view of this fact therefore, we have realized that in order to motivate them, programming practices must be related to other areas of their degree, in accordance with some principles of the EHEA (European Higher Education Area) process currently being implanted in European universities. This paper presents the work done over a ten year period in which we have tried to motivate the participation of the students studying Telecommunications Engineering in the University of Malaga during their studies. Conceptual maps produced as the result of a coordinated process between several professors in the different areas of the syllabus were used to design the practices and as a result the student success rate has improved while absenteeism has dropped.

AB  - Commercial computer games contain "physics engine" components, responsible for providing realistic interactions among game objects. The question naturally arises of whether these engines can be used to develop educational materials for high school and university physics education. To answer this question, the author's group recently conducted a detailed scientific investigation of the physics engine of Unreal Tournament 2004 (UT2004). This article presents their motivation, methodology, and results. The author presents the findings of experiments that probed the accessibility and fidelity of UT2004's physics engine, examples of educational materials developed, and an evaluation of their use in high school classes. The associated pedagogical implications of this approach are discussed, and the author suggests guidelines for educators on how to deploy the approach. Key resources are presented on an associated Web site.

AB  - The work analyzes the theoretical guidelines of the Flipped Classroom methodology and presents as its objective the proposal of a methodology. A mixed investigation is proposed, based on the theoretical review of works that have contributed to its development, the use of analysis-synthesis methods; induction-deduction and a conceptual map is obtained that summarizes a proposal for its application and a set of characteristics that systematize its advantages and limitations. It is applied to an experimental group and it is compared with a control group in the Natural Science subject of fourth grade at the Guillermo Arosemena Colonel school. In the experimental group, the acquisition of competences by the students stands out, such as: autonomy, ability to learn to learn and development of teamwork with the application of the Spearman Correlation test; as well as better results in the teaching -learning process. Similarly, a survey is applied to the parents, proven to be reliable and valid, which allows the use of the Iadov test and the Net Promoter Score with results that show satisfaction, feasibility of application and willingness to recommend.

AB  - Undoubtedly, the current complex socio-environmental situation requires a scientific culture that provides citizens with tools to intervene in their reality. In the context of teacher training, this becomes more relevant if we understand education as the transforming engine of society. To this end, we present a research based on the design and development of a didactic proposal for learning how to construct scientific knowledge and its social construction for a socio-environmental problem on which they must pass judgment: intensive livestock farming. The multidisciplinary treatment of this problem allows us, firstly, to present the network of problems and content that have been subject to research and, subsequently, to know how much the participants learnt about the main features of the research methodology. The 12 research projects, each prepared by a group of students of the Degree of Primary School Education, have been analysed.

AB  - The proposed lesson, a model active-learning activity designed to give college students experience in synthesizing information and developing a solution, can be used to address socioscientific issues across fields. As a consequence of climate change, global temperatures are anticipated to rise. This rise in temperature is expected to have a negative impact on agricultural systems due in part to increased disease incidence and decrease in crop yields. This activity is written in the context of plant pathology and agricultural systems to emphasize the importance of collaboration and communication among scientists or experts in different fields to address global agricultural issues. Students will gain an understanding of the importance of agriculture on a global scale and work together to develop a solution through the development of an agricultural policy.

AB  - Problem Statement: The effectiveness of science instruction, which aims to assure students' complete and accurate understanding of science concepts, can only be effectively evaluated when it is measured using the appropriate measurement tools. Concept maps, multiple-choice tests, and interviews - all of which are employed in determining students' understanding of science concepts - have been shown to be successful methods. However, each has its own limitations. In determining students' understanding of concepts, the use of two-tier tests - which evaluate students' understanding more effectively and which are easy to score and apply - is recommended.
   Purpose of Study: One of the topics of biology that students experience great difficulty in understanding is genetics. This study aims at developing a two-tier test which is able to effectively evaluate secondary education students' understanding of the concepts of genetics, and conducting the validity and reliability analyses of the test.
   Methods: The two-tier test, which is aimed at determining secondary education students' understanding of the fundamental concepts of genetics, was developed using a three-phase method. In the first phase, the test content was defined. In the second phase, the relevant literature was examined so as to determine students' misunderstandings; students were interviewed, and they were given a multiple choice test with free-response answers in which they had to explain the reasons for their answers. In the third phase, 14 two-tier test items which were composed of multiple choice content questions in the first tier and a set of five justifications for every potentially selected response to the first tier were developed. The test was applied to 231 students, and then item analysis was performed. Test reliability was calculated using the Kuder-Richardson 20 formula. In order to determine construct validity, the method of group differences was employed.
   Findings and Results: The discrimination indices of items were found to be between 0.34 and 0.74. Item difficulties fell in the range of 0.25 to 0.67, and the test difficulty was found to be 0.43. Test reliability was calculated as 0.86.
   Conclusions: All the findings obtained from the item analysis, in addition to the findings from the validity and the reliability studies; demonstrate that the test may be utilized to determine secondary education students' understanding of the concepts of genetics concepts in a valid and reliable way.
   Recommendations: Besides making a more effective evaluation possible, two-tier tests facilitate application and scoring. Therefore, we believe that developing and using such two-tier diagnostic tests in various fields will make significant contributions to science instruction.

AB  - A characteristic feature of scientific knowledge is the high degree of coherence and connectedness of its conceptual structure. This notion is also behind the widely accepted instructional method of representing the concepts as networks. We suggest here that notions of explanatory coherence and deductive coherence naturally connect the structure of knowledge to the processes which are important in constructing the concept networks. Of these processes, experimental method and modelling are shown to be closely connected with explanatory and deductive coherence, respectively. From this viewpoint, we compare here how experts and novices represent their physics knowledge in the form of concept networks, and show that significant differences between experts' and novices' quality of knowledge become directly reflected in the structure of the networks. The results also show how concept networks make visible both the structure of knowledge and the methodological procedures, which support its formation.

AB  - The advancement of mobile technology has influenced teaching and learning at various educational levels. The mobility, ubiquity, and connectivity of mobile devices help to foster meaningful learning experience across contexts and in different subject areas. Positive results from mobile learning have been reported in the current literature. To help to further the discussion and provide references for practitioners at various educational levels, this paper categorizes main pedagogical practices of mobile learning in K-12 and higher education settings into nine types: situated learning, communication and collaborative learning, game-based learning, inquiry-based learning, informal learning, personalized learning, behaviorist learning activities, learning content access and review, student engagement and motivation. Mobile learning in distance education is also discussed.

AB  - Problem solving is a highly valued skill in chemistry. Courses within this discipline place a substantial emphasis on problem-solving performance and tend to weigh such performance heavily in assessments of learning. Researchers have dedicated considerable effort investigating individual factors that influence problem-solving performance. The purpose of this study is to inspect the influences of a core set of factors (prior science achievement, knowledge structures, spatial ability, gender, and ethnicity) and their overall contributions to problem solving in organic chemistry using multivariate regression analyses. Results indicate that knowledge structures are a key predictor of problem-solving performance and account for a significant proportion of the variation in students' problem-solving scores. Implications for research and practice in chemistry are discussed.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has caused widespread deaths, illnesses, and societal disruption. I describe here how I pivoted a discussion-based senior biology capstone course to include a multiweek module surrounding one primary literature paper on the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 and the subsequent scientific discourse about the paper. Using a gradual reveal of the paper following the CREATE method (consider, read, elucidate, and think of the next experiment), I challenged students to learn new evolutionary principles and critically analyze the data surrounding the evolution and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 presented in the paper. I also provide general advice for implementing this module in future courses.

AB  - Reflection has recently been emphasized as a constructive pedagogical activity. However, little attention has been given to the quality of reflections that students write. In this study, we explored the reflections that students make about their knowledge organization as part of a formative learning activity. More specifically, we assessed the knowledge structures of Grade 11 physics students and their instructors using pathfinder networks (PFnets). Each student's knowledge structure was compared with the instructors' averaged knowledge structure in order to identify student misconceptions. As an intervention, students were asked to write reflections on the discrepancies between their knowledge structure and their instructors' averaged knowledge structure. The students' reflections were divided into the following three categories depending on the type of knowledge constructed in those reflections: (1) conceptual, (2) procedural, or (3) declarative. Evidence was provided by the study that reflection was an effective means of improving students' knowledge structure. However, conceptual reflections were the most effective, followed by procedural and declarative reflection. Implications for formative classroom assessment are discussed.

AB  - Despite that BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) technology model has been increasingly adopted in education, few studies have been reported on how to integrate various apps on BYOD into inquiry-based pedagogical practices in primary schools. This article reports a case study, examining what apps on BYOD can help students enhance their science learning, and how students develop their science knowledge in a seamless inquiry-based learning environment supported by these apps. A variety of qualitative data were collected and analyzed. The findings show that the affordances of the apps on BYOD could help students improve their science knowledge without time and place constraints and gain a better sense of ownership in learning.

AB  - We present a system that utilizes a wide variety of available assessment information to automatically analyze students' understanding at a conceptual level and offer relevant automated support to teachers and students. This support includes interactive visualization of the conceptual knowledge assessment, individualized suggestions for resources to improve areas of weakness, and suggestions for dynamic student groups for in-class activities. This system differs from prior related work in that the basis for analysis and feedback is entirely customized to the individual instructors' course content. We discuss how the system is configured for each course, and provide evidence that this configuration process helps instructors improve their course content. We then provide detailed descriptions of how the system performs analysis and offers support including suggesting resources for students and creating dynamic groups within a class. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits provided by this system and how the system is being applied to six different computer science courses currently.

AB  - Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student- generated visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle school science concept learning. In a post- test- only- control- group design, scores were compared among a control- group ( n= 28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper ( n= 30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers ( n= 34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post- test than the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group's scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups indicating that visualization might interact with learner characteristics.

AB  - Research in chemical education should be theory-based. Although this assertion would seem to most to be noncontroversial, it is common to find research studies in the literature without the grounding of theory. Some would claim that theory is not necessary, because research should be focused on answering narrow questions that would more likely appeal to practitioners. Nevertheless, theory-driven research has advantages for the development and growth of the discipline of chemical education. Theory can guide research, practice, curriculum development, evaluation, and help develop effective instructional tactics and strategies. Furthermore, it is not clear that theory-free research can exist. A researcher who doesn't articulate an underlying theory about how learning takes place is probably still operating on a theory of learning and making educational decisions about how learning takes place. Theory about learning chemistry can be derived from established disciplines like psychology, sociology, and philosophy. A consideration of prominent learning theories derived from these sources demonstrates the power of theory-based research strategies.

AB  - Although numerous studies have shown which educational design principles influence academic success, it remains a challenge to implement these design principles into daily practice. An explanation for the discrepancy between knowledge from scientific research about what works and daily practice can also be attributed to the implementation process of design principles; often the implementation ignores the fact that the teacher is the central link in the educational innovation process. In this study we examined the teacher perceptions about measures that can be used to promote study success. Results show which insights from the research literature show similarities with the perceptions of teachers (formative testing, working in small groups), but more importantly, the results also show in which respects the perceptions of teachers contradict with the findings from the research literature (students determine assessment moments themselves, use of web lectures). The used method not only offers the possibility to formulate widely supported policies that incorporate the vision of the institution, but also provides a basis for formulating a teacher development program.

AB  - This is a pilot study of an instructional technique that teaches important solid mechanics concepts within the context of an entrepreneurship case study and lab. Students were tested pre- and-post the case study/lab experiences to determine changes in engineering and entrepreneurial content knowledge, entrepreneurial self-efficacy and career intent. Results show that students can increase their knowledge of targeted entrepreneurship concepts without diminishment of learning core engineering concepts. While the case study experience did not significantly change entrepreneurial career intentions it did grow students' perceived entrepreneurial self-efficacy (as measured by confidence in business skills), which can be a precursor to changing career intent. The case study experience also appealed to a broad spectrum of students with career interests ranging from working for a start-up to working for an established global business. The implications of entrepreneurial case study instruction are discussed.

AB  - How human beings organize knowledge and to what extent individuals' organizational structures overlap are important research questions in cognitive science (Lakoff, 1987) as well as in information science (Ingwersen, 1992). Effective IR principles can be derived from,the understanding of human knowledge organizational structures. This project explores a Held study design to observe learners' organization of concepts of a subject domain during a course of learning. The purpose of the study is two-fold: (1) to investigate how learners build and organize concepts foamed along the process and (2) to design data collection methods and instruments. The project is carried out in two Introductory information science courses as two studies. The ultimate goal is also two-fold: (1) to facilitate learning in introductory courses by adopting metacognitive tools and (2) to advance information retrieval by incorporating effective knowledge structures into IR systems.

AB  - Increasing knowledge integration has gained wide-spread support as an important goal in engineering education. The Chemical Engineering Pillars curriculum is one of the first fully integrated curricula in engineering, and is specifically designed to facilitate knowledge integration. This curriculum, in use for just over 5 years, is unique for its use of block scheduling. Block scheduling, in its simplest form, is transforming multi-semester courses into a singlesemester course via extended, concentrated contact time. Among other things, the flexibility afforded by extended and more frequent contact time allows (and encourages) greater opportunity for active and collaborative learning. The specific adaption of this technique to chemical engineering has resulted in a curriculum comprised of 6 "Pillar" courses which are taken individually in 6 consecutive undergraduate semesters and are accompanied by vertically integrated laboratory experiences.

AB  - Electronic Learning has been one of the foremost trends in education so far. Such importance draws the attention to an important shift in the educational paradigm. Due to the complexity of the evolving paradigm, the prospective dynamics of learning require an evolution of knowledge delivery and evaluation. This research work tries to put in hand a futuristic design of an autonomous and intelligent e-Learning system. In which machine learning and user activity analysis play the role of an automatic evaluator for the knowledge level. It is important to assess the knowledge level in order to adapt content presentation and to have more realistic evaluation of online learners. Several classification algorithms are applied to predict the knowledge level of the learners and the corresponding results are reported. Furthermore, this research proposes a modern design of a dynamic learning environment that goes along the most recent trends in e-Learning. The experimental results illustrate an overall performance superiority of a support vector machine model in evaluating the knowledge levels; having 98.6% of correctly classified instances with 0.0069 mean absolute error.

AB  - The United Nations Security Council reports HIV/AIDS as the fastest growing threat to human development. In addition, the World Health Organization [1] reports that nearly 5 million persons (4.3 million adults and 700,000 children) are newly infected with HIV each year; more than 95% of them found in developing countries. Since STDs as a group are a personal problem which few people feel comfortable discussing, we believe that hand-held PDAs can provide an opportunity for learning about this disease while insuring anonymity. This device will employ the newest technologies including Bluetooth wireless technology, which can transmit and receive data via a short-range radio link using a globally available frequency band (2.4 GHz ISM band), enabling rapid and accurate synchronous and asynchronous data communication. The first generation of Bluetooth permits exchange of data up to a rate of 1 Mbps, even in areas with much electromagnetic disturbance. This emerging technology can facilitate HIV/AIDS outreach around the globe.
   Recent advances in learning have taken a particularly cognitive perspective and these findings have implications for education in general as well as for the development of intelligent tutoring systems in particular. In the past, effective SmartBooks (TM) have been developed for AIDS education to disseminate the critical knowledge relevant to this epidemic [2].
   Since 1993, the proliferation of the World Wide Web has created a plethora of new opportunities for the delivery of electronic distance learning systems. However, we feel that it is important that a whatever technology is employed is based on a sound educational theory. A new, comprehensive, web-based learning system called SmartTutor has been developed, at Brooklyn College of The City University of New York [3]. This technology provides a user-friendly, self-paced, easy to modify, software environment intended to serve the user's learning needs and is based on a generic SmartTutor methodology organized around the use of concept mapping. Early assessment of SmartTutor has shown that it is well received by students and helps significantly in their learning processes. It is readily adaptable to the presentation of academic and more general subject matter such as the latest available information on HIV/AIDS. Our new HIV/AIDS SmartTutor will incorporate this SmartTutor paradigm. Our new SmartTutor would provide worldwide access to medical professionals as well as the general public to learn about HIV/AIDS. This new device could also provide a survey tool to facilitate HIV risk assessment. Demonstrations of the SmartTutor learning system will be presented and the continued development of the applications will be discussed.

T2  - 2011 ASEE ANNUAL CONFERENCE & EXPOSITION
CP  - ASEE Annual Conference and Exposition
AB  - The study of linear physical systems is one of the topics in engineering with a rich interplay among the topics and no natural order in which to present the material. In this paper, we describe a system that uses topic maps to emphasize these interrelationships without imposing an arbitrary hierarchy on the material presented. For example, in terms of types of systems, mechanical systems can be taught first, or electrical. In terms of transforms, Laplace can be taught first, or Fourier, or even the Z-transform. There are also many relationships between topics. Examples include the transforms mentioned previously, the different types of physical system (electrical, mechanical, thermal.), and different solution methods such as state-space and transfer functions. By their very nature, textbooks must present and follow a linear path through the material, and any two textbooks are likely to follow very different paths. Web-based presentation of the material removes part of this problem because the material need not be presented linearly, but raises the prospect of a chaotic portrayal of the subjects because HTML links are merely from text to text and have no inherent meaning.
   Another way to present such interrelated ideas is through the use of topic maps. Topic maps are used to represent these interrelationships using topics (concepts), associations (the relationships between topics) and occurrences (information, e.g., web pages, relating to the topics). This is distinct from concept maps and other commonly used visual methods for organizing information in that the ideas need not be hierarchical; for example Fourier Transforms are not a subset of Laplace transforms (or vice-versa) as is presented in most textbooks. In addition the topics have certain roles in the association that give the link meaning, a clear advantage over traditional HTML hyperlinks and other methods.
   We have developed a system using HTML, PHP, JavaScript and XML that enables a user to author a topic map, as well as to present a graphical visualization of that map. When visualizing a map, a topic is selected (by clicking on it), and all related topics are displayed around it. Included in the display are the associations and roles played by each topic in that association. Topics can also have other information (occurrences in the form of HTML links, simulations...) that give explanatory detail about the topic, including descriptions of how it is related to other, associated, topics. While many textbooks (and even web-based presentations) have only short sections describing the interrelationships between topics, this system puts the relationship at the core of the presentation of the material to make it more clear why a particular topic is being learned and how it fits into the larger context of linear systems.

AB  - Many studies carried out on the mole concept emphasize that students show significant difficulties in learning this concept. The aim of our research was to analyze those difficulties that students, who have their first contact with chemistry in school, encounter, and also to examine the usefulness of systemics as a graphical way of knowledge representation. The sample of the study included seventh grade students from a primary school in Novi Sad, Serbia. Based on the results of the pre-test, students were divided into three main groups: "excellent", "good" and "acceptable", which all consisted of two subgroups: experimental and control. Students in the experimental subgroup were learning by applying systemics, while the students in the control subgroup were taught by traditional method. The final results show that systemics is convenient in overcoming the difficulties in the case of "excellent" and "acceptable" groups of students, while the same cannot be concluded for the students characterized as "good". Systemics has not proved to be adequate for them. The following question remains a topic for the future research: Is there any way that the group of students characterized as "good" still benefits from learning with systemics? In addition, new research on a larger number of students should be conducted, in order to statistically confirm these results, or to discuss new ones.

AB  - This article critically discusses the ecology of public schools in the United States: systemic barriers and associated biases that permeate these learning contexts and derail efforts to close opportunity gaps for African American adolescents with emotional and behavioral challenges. Using results from a mixed-methods study, we illustrate the ubiquity of an a-developmental perspective that guides perceptions of what is needed to keep these students in and successful at school. A close examination of school mental health providers' perceptions of what is important and feasible in public school contexts shows recommended interventions to be necessary but not sufficient. We highlight important considerations in the reframe of schools as a dynamic developmental system and conclude with recommendations about how to harness adolescents' strengths to generate strategies that move us toward more equitable and socially just schooling.

AB  - Energy as an integrating concept is currently a widely discussed subject in didactics of physics among its representatives. Many theoretical works and book publications related issues have been published in various didactic teaching approaches. Our work also concerns the same subject. We are focusing on an innovative, however not frequently used, method in evaluating teaching process, which uses graphical depiction-conceptual mapping. The conceptual mapping belongs to strategies leading to meaningful learning. Based on conceptual maps, it is possible to look into the pupils' minds, in which they create their own structure, made up of familiar as well as new concepts. Comparison of complex conceptual maps of related concepts can provide an image of their hierarchical structure. Conceptual maps are investigated using the methods of analysis of semantic networks. Using this method, we were detecting whether a selected group of pupils from elementary school perceived terms related to energy from its integrative point of view, or primarily from one perspective, only within the subject of physics. The aim was to find out whether pupils are able to connect meaning of the terms related to energy in science (physics, biology, chemistry) and also in technology. The integrating role of the concept of energy have to be reflected in the hierarchical structure of the conceptual maps.

AB  - With the expansion of maker programs in school and out-of-school settings, investigating the connections between making and learning is important for many reasons, not least to build the evidence base needed by educators committed to its practice. In this paper, we argue that, as a relatively new area of inquiry, studies of making can benefit from close dialogue between researchers and the practitioners who have pioneered and continue to develop the practice. We share how a research-practice partnership sought to amplify the voices of informal educators leading afterschool maker programs to address the research question: How can afterschool maker programs support student learning that is valued and relevant to the school day? We show how the research-practice partnership helped to refine a pedagogical framework describing learning dimensions of making and tinkering in ways that reflect the values and expert knowledge of informal educators committed to liberatory forms of education for young people, particularly those from socio-economically and racially marginalized communities.

AB  - The study reported here is part of a larger project designed to understand student learning during conversations with their teacher over and about a computer-based Newtonian microworld (Interactive Physics(TM)). At the focus of this report are affordances of the microworld to a teacher who engaged his students in conversations about representations of phenomenal objects and conceptual entities that constitute the microworld. The study shows how the teacher used the context of Interactive Physics(TM) to identify students' ways of seeing and talking science. He then implemented a series of strategies to make forces ''visible'' to students. Data are provided to illustrate that students' learning was not local but persistent, so that they used appropriate canonical science talk without teacher support. The conclusion focuses on Interactive Physics(TM) as a tool that does not embed meaning as such, but takes on meaning as part of the specific (scientific) practices in the context of which it was used.

AB  - Purpose - The Operations and Maintenance (O&M) cost of a facility is typically 60-85% of the total life cycle cost of a building whereas its design and construction cost accounts for only 5-10%. Therefore, enhancing and optimizing the O&M of a facility is a crucial issue. In addition, with the increasing complexities in a building's operating systems, more technologically advanced solutions are required for proactively maintaining a facility. Thereby, a tool is needed which can optimize and reduce the cost of facility maintenance. One of the solutions is Augmented or Mixed Reality (AR/MR) technologies which can reduce repair time, training time and streamline inspections. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to establish contextual knowledge of AR/MR application in facilities operation and maintenance and present an implementation framework through the analysis and classification of articles published between 2015 and 2022.Design/methodology/approach - To effectively understand all AR/MR applications in facilities management (FM), a systematic literature review is performed. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) protocol was followed for searching and describing the search strategies. Keywords were identified through the concept mapping technique. The Scopus database and Google Scholar were employed to find relevant articles, books and conference papers. A thorough bibliometric analysis was conducted using VOS Viewer and subsequently, a thematic analysis was performed for the selected publications.Findings - The use of AR/MR within facilities O&M could be categorized into five different application areas: (1) visualization; (2) maintenance; (3) indoor localization and positioning; (4) information management and (5) indoor environment. After a thematic analysis of the literature, it was found that maintenance and indoor localization were the most frequently used research application domains. The chronological evolution of AR/ MR in FM is also presented along with the origin of publications, which showed that the technology is out of its infancy stage and is ready for implementation. However, literature showed many challenges hindering this goal, that is (1) reluctance of the organizational leadership to bear the cost of hardware and trainings for the employees, (2) Lack of BIM use in FM and (3) system lagging, crashing and unable to register the real environment. A preliminary framework is presented to overcome these challenges. Originality/value - This study accommodates a variety of application domains within facilities O&M. The publications were systematically selected from the existing literature and then reviewed to exhibit various AR/MR applications to support FM. There have been no literature reviews that focus on AR and/or MR in the FM and this paper fills the gap by not only presenting its applications but also developing an implementation framework.

AB  - This article presents a study of whether pre-conceptual maps, used as a teaching strategy in preschool, help improve the oral speech utilized by pupils to interpret or read such maps. The primary interest of this study is to ascertain what type of evolution occurs in the three basic dimensions of language: vocabulary, syntax and amplitude of discourse. An endeavour is made to infer whether the hypothetical improvement in pupils' oral speech has an impact on the evolution of their pre-conceptual competence.
   The didactic work is based on the theory of assimilation (Ausubel, Novak and Hanesian, 1983), considered as the generic conceptual framework that provides an appropriate learning model for the cognitive tracking the project sought to find, because the authors affirm that at some point between the fourth and the fifth year of life, language assumes a dominant role in cognitive functioning (Ausubel et al., 1983, 82).
   Twenty preschoolers were involved in this research (12 girls and eight boys), from an early childhood education class for five-year-olds in a public school located in a rural context in the province of Seville. Ninety-three texts produced orally by the participants in the project were analyzed following a categorical system created on the basis of data analysis, and a system of triangulation based on the agreement of three judges (teacher, expert and researcher) was applied to ensure the consistency of the rankings.
   In conclusion, with all due caution in the light of the shortage of participants and the limited number of sessions analyzed, moderate improvement was found in the oral discourse that students used to "read" their maps, and therefore pre-conceptual maps may be regarded as an appropriate teaching strategy for early childhood education.

AB  - The subject materials of most enterprise e-training programs were mainly developed by employees of the enterprises; therefore, it becomes a challenging issue to efficiently and effectively translate the knowledge and experiences of the employees to computerized subject materials, especially for those who are not an experienced teacher. In addition, to develop an e-training course, personal ignorance or incorrect concepts might significantly affect the quality of the course if only a single employee is asked to develop the subject materials. To cope with this problem, a multi-expert e-training course design model is proposed in this paper. Accordingly, an e-training course development system has been implemented. Moreover, a practical application has showed that of the novel approach not only can improve the quality of the e-training course, but also help the experts to organize their domain knowledge.

AB  - Analytical quality assurance, especially testing, is an integral part of software-intensive system development. With the increased usage of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as part of such systems, this becomes more difficult as well-understood software testing approaches cannot be applied directly to the AI-enabled parts of the system. The required adaptation of classical testing approaches and the development of new concepts for AI would benefit from a deeper understanding and exchange between AI and software engineering experts. We see the different terminologies used in the two communities as a major obstacle on this way. As we consider a mutual understanding of the testing terminology a key, this paper contributes a mapping between the most important concepts from classical software testing and AI testing. In the mapping, we highlight differences in the relevance and naming of the mapped concepts.

AB  - With a view to the active learning, that makes the students protagonists, responsible and aware of the learning process, the present study presents an experimental work designed to demonstrate the usefulness and the validity of the scientific method as the basic element of the teaching of Life Sciences.
   The experimental research was implemented in two second grade classes of a Primary School in San Dona di Piave (Italy), and its purpose was to test the potency of a teaching approach based on the scientific method, in particular on the observational-comparative method, in the teaching of Life Sciences, focused on the structure of the flower and the inflorescences. For this reason it was decided that within one of two classes was used the experimental method instead of a traditional teaching-learning method based on the oral transmission of contents.
   The experimental work was preceded by a survey on didactics, aimed to identify methods and teaching practices adopted by teachers of Natural Sciences of the Primary School, especially for the Biology and in particular for the flower and the inflorescences. From this preliminary investigation it was found that the teachers of the Primary School do not use tools such as the stereoscope for viewing biological material, despite they claim to take an active approach for the teaching of Science using the appropriate scientific instruments. The results also have shown that the majority of teachers do not propose a macroscopic observation and the dissection of a flower as a sample.
   In the research class were carried out different theoretical phases always followed by a practical approach, which involved the comparison of species of flowers. So students were able to create concept maps of the new learning, on the solid basis of direct observations and experiments conducted in person. Besides during the action, students were invited to use scientific tools in each lesson as magnifiers, stereoscope, real specimens of flowers. Active teaching and direct observation of flower structures reinforced the concepts theoretically exposed. In this way it was also confirmed the high teaching potential of the integration of macroscopic and microscopic observations.
   The observational-comparative method is a key component for the study of the Biology; for this reason all the topics linked to the study of the plants can be addressed through the use of this active methodology. This kind of approach can motivate students, making them active participants in their own learning.
   The obtained results showed that, using the scientific method and laboratory tools such as the optical microscope or the magnifiers, conceptualizations planned for fifth grade, can be met with success also in second grade, helping to reach the programmed goals optimally and often excellently, facilitating the achievement of competences such as the use of a correct scientific nomenclature. With this approach, the young students were motivated, stimulated, intrigued, and this potentially provides a meaningful, authentic and transferable Lifelong Learning and the development of a scientific culture together with an early interest in the Sciences.

TI  - ENHANCING CONCEPTUAL THINKING WITH INTERACTIVE CONCEPT DISCOVERY (INCOD)
T2  - 9TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON EDUCATION AND NEW LEARNING TECHNOLOGIES (EDULEARN17)
CP  - 9th International Conference on Education and New Learning Technologies (EDULEARN)
AB  - Interactive Concept Discovery (InCoD), based on Concept Parsing Algorithms (CPA), is a novel learning tool in the context of pedagogy for conceptual thinking. It support semantic searches of Key Word In Context (KWIC), an interactive procedure that use text analysis (concordance; collocation; co-occurrence; word frequency) and allows students to explore the course Knowledge Repository (KR) for discovery of conceptual contents. InCoD guides sequential teaching/learning episodes in an academic course by focusing learners' attention on conceptual meaning.
   InCoD is part of a pedagogical approach that is very different from the usual classroom scenario where students are given a problem-solving exercise and asked to solve it individually. Pedagogy for conceptual thinking include weekly formative assessments, structured to provide opportunities for students to discuss and exchange ideas; to share and contrast points-of-view; to prompt and refresh each other's memory regarding important details of the conceptual situation; and to 'compare notes' about possible responses.
   In weekly searches with InCoD the learner reads and annotates found documents, and evaluates their degree of relevance to the specific conceptual situation under consideration; creates his/her Individual Index with alphabetic list of content words and annotations; and constructs concept maps with graphical visualizations that reveal patterns of associations among concepts. InCoD semantic searches prompt class discussions and lead to discovery of relations among co-occurring, subordinate concepts. They provide feedback that identify 'soft conceptual spots' in students' current understanding of important conceptual issues, and guide the instructor to initiate class activities to remedy conceptual misunderstandings. Systematic video recordings of small group discussions in weekly formative quizzes reveal enhanced students' engagement and peer cooperation, and members of a group listening intently to an individual presenting a convincing point-of-view. Pedagogy of conceptual thinking and peer cooperation in the classroom motivate and engage students, enhance learning outcomes and higher-order thinking. This is particularly important in large undergraduate classes.
   Our experience in implementing Interactive Concept Discovery (InCoD) in Canada, Russia, Israel, Australia, and Italy, include: Ontario Institute for Studies in Education of University of Toronto (OISE/UT); Roots and Routes Summer Institute, University of Toronto, Scarborough; Faculty of Engineering and Architectural Science at Ryerson University, Toronto; Independent Learning Center (ILC) of TVOntario; Material and Manufacturing Ontario (MMO) Centre of Excellence; Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto; Russian Academy of Sciences - Lycee, loffe Physico-Technical Institute, St. Petersburg; Meir Medical Center, Kfar Saba, Israel; Faculty of Engineering, Ben Gurion University, Israel; School of Education, University of New England, Australia; and M@t.abel, the Italian national mathematics educational program, coordinated academically by the Department of Mathematics at University of Turin. These implementations include workshops for training of instructors, and classroom implementations in several knowledge domains: Language (ESL; learning disabilities); Social Science (psychology; teacher education); History; Architecture; Mathematics (algebra; geometry; statistics); Science (physics; biology); Health; Business (project management; risk management).

AB  - The aim of this paper is to present an empirical study with the intention of answering the question: can an intentionally structured online environment stimulate and enhance the processes of mutual interaction and hybridization between digital artefacts and analogic artefacts (books) so as to encourage the development of significant learning in students?
   This research, carried out in the academic year 2018/2019, involved 183 Italian students enrolled on the bachelor's degree in Primary Education Sciences at the University of Salerno attending the course "School experimentation and educational planning". The data were collected by working out and using an information retrieval questionnaire and four different tests. The virtual interaction space was e-LENA, the Learning Management System of the RIMEDI@ research lab.
   The experimental results highlight how this methodology, called DynaMap Remediation Approach (DMRA) by the authors, has had effects in terms of reducing study time and improving learning outcomes. The online learning environment stimulated to study in greater detail with a book, with the learner being able to restructure and systematize his own knowledge. The DMRA valorises the active role of the learner during his process of knowledge construction and may have significant implications for educators who would like to use innovative and effective online learning environments to enhance student learning.

AB  - The students of the Bachelor's Degree in Primary Education (BDPE) have a very heterogeneous natural science background and sometimes, they drag certain prejudices towards the Science subjects because they consider them outside their future professional field. However, Natural Sciences constitutes a core subject in the Primary Education stage, according to the curriculum, and therefore, as future teachers they must teach the subject for two hours per week. An innovative way of approaching the scientific world without fear, is to use dramatization experiences, through which in addition to developing their basic and specific skills as future teachers, they learn in a creative and meaningful way a specific topic of the subject Teaching Natural Sciences. In this experience developed with students of the BDPE of the Public University of Navarra, it is shown how it is possible to use dramatization in science subjects to learn specific subjects of natural sciences, in a playful atmosphere. Finally, a questionnaire was carried out to the students after the activity to assess the experience, considering it an innovative proposal, highly creative and applicable to their future teaching practice.

AB  - For beginning teachers to make the transition to full professional membership they need to increase their professional knowledge of the art and science of teaching. This paper explores the difference in knowledge growth between beginning teachers who commence teaching in fragmented teaching situations in the first two years of teaching, and their colleagues who have stable, secure and continuing employment during this time. This paper argues that the employment context in which beginning teachers take up their profession has a significant, but hitherto largely unacknowledged, effect on the capacity of teachers to develop the craft of teaching (Elbaz, 1983); on their continuing commitment to the profession; and on their self-confidence and self-image as teachers It is concluded that long-term, secure employment in one school, with full responsibility for a class of students and access to effective mentoring, is necessary if beginning teachers are to move beyond 'survival' to developing competency in the first two years of teaching.

AB  - Owing to the popularity of mobile, wireless communication and sensing technologies, issues related to contextual mobile learning have widely been discussed in recent years. In the meantime, researchers have indicated the importance of developing effective strategies for guiding students to learn in context-aware learning environments. In this study, a progressive prompt-based context-aware learning approach is proposed to improve the learning performance of students. An experiment was conducted on a natural science course of an elementary school to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach. From the experimental results, it is found that the proposed approach could effectively enhance the learning achievement of the students in comparison with the conventional context-aware learning system with single-stage prompts. It is also interesting to find that the proposed approach, by providing more challenging tasks, encouraged the students to put more effort into examining the contextual information and interpreting the learning content.

AB  - For the purpose of this discussion a concept is defined as a class of stimuli which have common characteristics. It is not a stimulus but the classification of certain stimuli (de Cecco and Crawford, 1974; Gunter, Estes, and Schwab, 1999; Heywood, 1997; McDonald, 1968). Concepts are of varying degrees of abstraction, and some are more open to misinterpretation than others, as for example, "democracy." Such concepts are sometimes called "fuzzy" (Dunleavy, 1986; Howard, 1987). Concepts are the building blocks of knowledge. In engineering, concepts such as acceleration and velocity are often misperceived, as the research by Clement (1981, 1982) and many others shows.
   The development of conceptual knowledge and procedural knowledge go hand in hand; that is abstract knowledge of concepts informs doing and knowledge obtained from doing informs conceptual understanding. The two function together in intricate ways (McCormick, 1997). Understanding concepts is the basis of metacognition.
   The transfer of knowledge is not possible without an understanding of the concepts involved. The way that schema are constructed by individuals distinguishes the "expert" from the "novice". This has consequences for teaching and learning.
   Principles or rules derive from relationships between concepts. A model of learning applied to teaching is used to illustrate this point (Gagne, 1967, 1984).
   The usual way of teaching concepts is through examples. Even this is fraught with dificulty, and the way in which examples and non-examples are sequenced can influence learning (Heywood, 1997). Other methods of teaching concepts include analogies and metaphors (Gunter, Estes, and Schwab, 1999; Howard, 1987).
   The knowledge required for a particular field of study may be described as an integrated framework of "key concepts." Such maps as these frameworks are sometimes called express and contain the essential knowledge required for the curriculum in that field. Their attainment is, therefore, an objective, hence the inclusion of key concepts among the aims and objectives in the models of the curriculum process (see Figures 1.4 and 1.5). But they may also help teachers understand how students learn, in addition, tests can indicate the misperceptions that students have of particular concepts.
   Teachers may discover students' misperceptions by using concept inventories and protocols. Concept mapping may also be used for this purpose. Such maps are not only helpful in the design of the curriculum (using key concepts), but also can help the teacher understand (a) how students learn, and (b) the different stages they move through from being a novice to becoming an expert.
   The importance of concept learning in engineering is underlined by the special panel that discussed the problem at the 2002 Frontiers in Education Conference."(1)

AB  - Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, computers in science teaching were seen as a panacea for many problems plaguing the domain. While considerable research has been done to determine cognitive achievements of students who interact with computers during their science learning, more basic questions have not yet been addressed. This study was designed to investigate how computers and a modeling software contributed to students' interactions and learning in a physics course. The interpretations focused on the microworld as a tool that supported but also limited students' sense-making activities. First, the computer microworld contributed in significant ways to the maintenance and coordination of students' physics conversations. Second, the computer environment (a) was sometimes ''unready to hand'' so that students spent more time learning the software rather than physics, and (b) limited the interactions within groups. It was concluded that while computer environments have some potential as learning tools, they also limit interactions in significant ways, rendering them less than ideal for everyday classroom use.

AB  - Explanation of natural phenomena at one level of biological organisation almost always involves causes that are found at other levels. Although scientists thinking across levels find it easy to explain physiological phenomena, students often perceive this as a challenge. We developed a new graphic organiser called Zoom Map, which is a mode for structuring biological information along the levels of biological organisation and is designed to guide biology students when they need to consider the levels of organisation. The aim of this study is to examine how Zoom Map helps students explain a common phenomenon in plant physiology: leaves that are upright or wilted. Accordingly, we designed a teaching experiment covering 13 students. During the experiments, the students were videotaped. We used qualitative content analysis to examine the explanations. Our findings indicate that Zoom Map improved students' explanations of the phenomenon across multiple levels of organisation: The students used more levels than before, and they referred to lower levels that were lacking previously. Therefore, it can be concluded that students who use Zoom Map are supported in their ability to explain a biological phenomenon across the levels of biological organisation.

AB  - This article presents new evidence to support the hypothesis that writing is an effective tool for meaningful learning of scientific concepts. With this purpose, a quasi-experiment was conducted with an experimental group, control group, pre-test and post-test in a public school in Santiago, Chile. The experimental group was given a teaching sequence designed to learn disciplinary knowledge from a process of textual composition that explicitly promotes the dialectic of writing; and the control group was given a sequence designed to learn the same disciplinary knowledge, but from traditional teaching strategies in the natural sciences. Through the enforcement of the pre-test and post-test, it was determined that students from the experimental group learned significantly more disciplinary knowledge than the control group. It is concluded that text production is an ability that should not only be developed in the subject of language, but in all other areas of the curriculum.

AB  - Across disciplines, it is common practice to bring together groups to solve complex problems. Facilitators are often asked to help groups organize information about and better understand the problem in order to develop and prioritize solutions. However, despite existence of several methods to elicit and characterize how individuals and groups think about and conceptualize an issue, many are difficult to implement in practice-based settings where resources such as technology and participant time are limited and research questions shift over time. This paper describes an easy-to-implement diagramming technique for eliciting conceptualization and a flexible network analysis method for characterizing changes in both individual and group conceptualization. We use a case example to illustrate how we used the methods to evaluate African American adolescent's conceptual understanding of obesity before and after participating in a series of four systems thinking workshops. The methods produced results that were sensitive to changes in conceptualization that were likely driven by the specific activities employed during the workshop sessions. The methods appear strong for capturing salient levels of conceptualization at both individual and collective levels. The paper concludes with a critical examination of strengths and weaknesses of the methods and implications for future practice and research.

AB  - This article presents procedures and results from a 2-year project developing science key vocabulary (KV) short tests suitable for progress monitoring Grade 5 science in Texas public schools using computer-generated, -administered, and -scored assessments. KV items included KV definitions and important usages in a multiple-choice cloze format. A KV and item database was constructed for all Grades 3, 4, and 5 science student outcomes by scrutinizing basal and supplemental instructional materials used in Texas schools. The resulting 620 KV terms and 1,800 test items were formatted for computer administration in computer-generated probes.This study examines results from equivalent KV-science probes, administered to students with special needs on a weekly basis, over 5 or 6 weeks. It also compares results from KV probes versus standard multiple-choice science items in simpler pre-post administration. Results encourage further development of KV-based probes for progress monitoring in the content area of science.

AB  - In this study, a mission synchronization-based peer-assistance approach is proposed to improve students' learning performance in digital game-based learning activities. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment has been conducted in an elementary school natural science course to examine the participants' learning attitudes, collaboration skills, and learning achievements. From the experimental results, it was found that the educational game with the mission synchronization-based peer-assistance mechanism not only benefited the students in terms of promoting their learning achievements and attitudes, but also improved their collaboration skills via encouraging them to actively provide assistance to their peers during the gaming process. Finally, to further investigate the factors that might affect the performance of the mission synchronization-based peer-assistance approach, the students' learning behaviors are summarized and discussed.

AB  - The purpose of the study was to measure the effects of higher level, inquiry-based science curricula on students at primary level in Title I schools. Approximately 3,300 K-3 students from six schools were assigned to experimental or control classes (N = 115 total) on a random basis according to class. Experimental students were exposed to concept-based science curriculum that emphasized 'deep learning' though concept mastery and investigation, whereas control classes learned science from traditional school-based curricula. Two ability measures, the Bracken Basic Concept Scale-Revised (BBCS-R, Bracken 1998) and the Naglieri Nonverbal Intelligence Test (NNAT, Naglieri 1991), were used for baseline information. Additionally, a standardized measure of student achievement in science (the MAT-8 science subtest), a standardized measure of critical thinking, and a measure for observing teachers' classroom behaviors were used to assess learning outcomes. Results indicated that all ability groups of students benefited from the science inquiry-based approach to learning that emphasized science concepts, and that there was a positive achievement effect for low socio-economic young children who were exposed to such a curriculum.

AB  - This work aims to show the main points of a project of teaching innovation in higher education at the University of Almeria in the 2018/2019 academic year. The field of application is the subject of Economics of the European Union, corresponding to the third year of the degree in Economics. The classes focus on a theoretical part with ten chapters that are reflected in the teaching guide and a practical part. It begins with the trade relations between countries and their integration processes (chapter 1), in which economic and financial globalization plays a fundamental role with the concentration of countries in economic blocs. Chapter 2 focuses on the historical evolution of European integration, highlighting the role of France and Germany in this process. The institutional framework is a fundamental issue in it and therefore there is a specific chapter on it (Chapter 3). Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the history and characteristics of the single European market, analysing the four basic freedoms (goods, services, capital, people and workers) and the creation of a common currency as the culmination of the process. The next chapter focuses on financing, one of the major issues for the European Union as it has no taxes of its own. This is why both the budget and the multiannual financial framework 2014-2020 (Chapter 6) are analysed. The last four chapters deal with the policies of the European Union in four main blocks: Common Agricultural Policy, Cohesion Policy, Foreign Policy and other internal policies.
   Innovation focuses on teaching through the application of new teaching techniques:
   Concept maps, which allow students to rank the main elements of a given issue in order to draw informed and consistent conclusions.
   Development of wikis to encourage a collaborative environment of autonomous research of students under the careful supervision of teachers.
   Role-playing games, in which the students acquire the point of view of the main actors of the European Union while acting as teachers of the rest of the students.
   Time lines, with which to provide students with a tool that enables them to order events chronologically, helping them to detect relationships causes effects that explain the current situation.
   Flipped classroom, which will open in-depth debates on current issues in which students will have to work on a critical attitude using their knowledge of the EU.
   Kahoot, an online questionnaire creation tool with which students learn while competing. The need to have the students' mobile phones will open lines of research that will address the advantages of these in the educational environment.
   The subject of Economics in the European Union is the subject of the degree in Economics which has the highest number of Erasmus students. Therefore, the application of innovative teaching techniques will demonstrate their efficiency and effectiveness in students with a wide range of educational backgrounds, thus opening up the opportunity to extrapolate the experience to other territories.

AB  - In nursing education, physiological concepts are typically presented within a body 'systems' framework yet learners are often challenged to apply this knowledge in the holistic and functional manner needed for effective clinical decision-making and safe patient care. A nursing faculty addressed this learning challenge by developing an advanced organizer as a conceptual and integrative learning tool to support learners in diverse learning environments and practice settings. A mixed methods research study was conducted that explored the effectiveness of the Oxygen Supply and Demand Framework as a learning tool in undergraduate nursing education. A pretest/post-test assessment and reflective journal were used to gather data.

AB  - Conceptual maps are a frequently used teaching method in science subjects at present. They can be applied in each of the basic parts of the teaching process. Teachers use them most often when introducing a new thematic unit, where they use a conceptual map to create an image network made up of elementary concepts that pupils are supposed to learn during the lesson, then in the fixation and repetition of the thematic unit or curriculum. However, teachers do not apply this method in practice so that pupils create a concept map themselves.
   This also deprives them of the knowledge of how to learn the curriculum more effectively and constructively understand the relationships between concepts. For this reason, we had to teach pupils how to create conceptual maps before starting the research.
   In this paper, we focused on finding the conceptual scale of the content of the concept of energy in the pupils as well as finding out the correct classification of terms into the hierarchical system through conceptual maps. We conducted pilot research of a qualitative nature.
   Our research sample consisted of elementary school pupils in Slovakia. They were 6th and 9th-grade pupils. Since it was qualitative research aimed at analyzing conceptual maps created by pupils, we chose a smaller number of respondents. Overall, there were 31 pupils of the 9th grade and 31 pupils of the 6th grade. In this paper, we present the results of the analysis of conceptual maps of ninth grade pupils. Conceptual maps of pupils of the 6th grade, were published and analyzed in another publication. It is interesting to compare conceptual maps in individual years. We chose classes at the beginning and at the end of the second stage of primary school, where we can compare the thinking and view of pupils before at the beginning of energy lessons in physics lessons and after completing physics in all years of physics at elementary school.
   The aim of our work was to find out which terms pupils of the 9th year of elementary school will relate to the term energy. We assumed that the pupils will introduce terms that are the content of all science subjects (chemistry, biology) and technology. We have found out that the prevailing concepts are the content of physics and technical education by analyzing conceptual maps. The results can tell us whether, based on the knowledge gathered so far in science and technology subjects, pupils are able to create a connection and coherence of the perception of the concept of energy across several subjects that it is one and the same fact. Pupils tend to perceive the content of the curriculum in isolation within only one subject with the increasing amount of curriculum. We also consider how we can eliminate or at least mitigate this effect of isolation of the concept of energy. We would also like to motivate teachers not only of Slovak schools to engage pupils more actively in the teaching process but also by using the conceptual mapping method, which contributes to the promotion of creative and critical thinking.

AB  - We previously developed an online multiple-choice question authoring, learning, and self-assessment tool that we termed Quizzical. Here we report statistical analyses over two consecutive years of Quizzical use in a large sophomore-level introductory molecular biology course. Students were required to author two questions during the term and were also afforded opportunities to earn marks for quiz participation. We found that students whose final grade was "A," "B," or "C" exhibited similar patterns of Quizzical engagement. The degree to which students participated was positively associated with performance on formal exams, even if prior academic performance was considered as a covariable. During both terms investigated, students whose Quizzical engagement increased from one exam to the next earned statistically significant higher scores on the subsequent exam, and students who attempted Quizzical questions from earlier in the term scored higher, on average, on the cumulative portion of the final exam. We conclude that the structure and value of the assignment, and the utility of Quizzical as a discipline-independent active-learning and self-assessment tool, enabled students to better master course topics.

AB  - This study investigates whether university students' epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge about controversial socioscientific issues (SSIs) can predict the different types of arguments that students construct. Two hundred forty-three university students were asked to construct different types of supportive arguments-social, ethical, economic, scientific, ecological-as well as counterarguments and rebuttals after they had read a scenario on a SSI. Participants' epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge were assessed separately. Results showed that students' epistemic beliefs and prior knowledge predicted the quantity, quality, and diversity of the different types of arguments the students constructed. In particular, students who held sophisticated epistemic beliefs about the structure of knowledge and exhibited relatively more robust prior knowledge scores, produced arguments of greater quantity, better quality, and higher diversity than students with less sophisticated epistemic beliefs and low prior knowledge scores. Educational implications are discussed.

AB  - One of the important goals of problem-based learning (PBL) in medical education is to enhance medical students' clinical reasoning-hypothetico-deductive reasoning (HDR) in particular-through small group discussions. However, few studies have focused on explicit strategies for promoting students' HDR during group discussions in PBL. This paper proposes a novel conceptual framework that integrates Toulmin's argumentation model (1958) into Barrows's HDR process (1994). This framework explains the structure of argumentation (a claim, data, and a warrant) contextualized in each phase of HDR during PBL. This paper suggests four instructional strategies-understanding argument structures, questioning, elaborating on structural knowledge, and assessing argumentation-for promoting medical students' argumentation in relation to HDR processes. Further implications of the proposed framework for other disciplines, such as science, legal, and engineering education, are also discussed.

AB  - With the deepening application of augmented reality (AR) in education, researches pay more attention to the evaluation of learning results rather than consider how to use teaching strategies to support personalized teaching. This study developed an AR science curriculum incorporating textual and collaborative scaffolding, and taught it in elementary school science classes to help students learn about scientific knowledge of lever principle. To explore the effects of different self-efficacy and scaffolding teaching strategies on students' learning conceptions and cognitive load, a two times two experiment was conducted on an elementary school. The results show that the use of textual and collaborative scaffolding in AR teaching can help students with low self-efficacy to pay attention to the conceptions of deep learning and effectively reduce the cognitive load of students.

AB  - Computational thinking (CT) uses concepts that are essential to computing and information science to solve problems, design and evaluate complex systems, and understand human reasoning and behavior. This way of thinking has important implications in computer sciences as well as in almost every other field. Therefore, we contend that CT should be taught in elementary schools and included in every university's educational curriculum. Several studies that measure the impact of teaching programming, analytical thinking, and CT have been conducted. In this review, we analyze and discuss findings from these studies and highlight the importance of learning programming with a focus on the development of CT skills at a young age. We also describe the tools that are available to improve the teaching of CT and provide a state-of-the-art overview of how programming is being taught at schools and universities in Colombia and around the world.

AB  - Most e-Training programs of enterprises were mainly developed by senior employees who have plenty of knowledge and experience: therefore, it becomes a challenging issue to efficiently and effectively translate the knowledge and experience of the engineers to computerized subject materials, especially for those who are not experienced teachers. In addition, to develop an e-Training course, personal ignorance or incorrect concepts might significantly affect the quality of the course if only a single employee is asked to develop the subject materials. To cope with this problem, a multi-expert e-Training course design model is proposed, and a computer-assisted e-Training course development system has been implemented accordingly. Moreover, a practical application has shown that the innovative approach not only can improve the quality of the e-Training courses, but also help experienced employees to well organize their domain knowledge.

AB  - Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) degrees represent a future employment scenario with low unemployment rates due to the high demand for qualified personnel. However, the STEM sector also represents an educational field marked by horizontal segregation and the gender gap. Different factors play a role in deciding which higher education studies to pursue. From a theoretical and empirical approach, this study aims to identify which factors are associated with the gender gap in the STEM higher education sector. Furthermore, as a research question, it is proposed: are the factors identified at a theoretical and empirical level associated with the gender gap in the STEM higher education sector the same? The empirically validated questionnaire "Questionnaire with university students on STEM studies in Higher Education" (QSTEMHE) was applied to the student community of public and private universities in Spain in 2021, using simple random probability sampling to answer the research question and objective. A final sample of 2101 participants of different genders belonging to different branches of knowledge was obtained. The data analysis was carried out using qualitative methodology and the phenomenological method, following different stages. Firstly, a theoretical conceptual map of the main factors identified in the literature and their authors was composed. Secondly, an empirical conceptual map has been designed with the factors identified in the narratives of the study participants. Finally, these maps were complemented with a SWOT analysis based on the participants' discourses. As a result, it has been observed that there are extrinsic and intrinsic factors and that social constructs and gender stereotypes strongly influence the perception of men, women, and professions and the masculinisation and feminisation of these. Outreach interventions should be proposed from the institutional educational spheres to alleviate existing biases about studies and professions.

AB  - Designer support is critical for facilitating collaboration and knowledge construction in an online learning environment. Designer support in this paper refers to the mechanisms that a designer builds in a technology-mediated environment to facilitate online learning. This paper focuses on two aspects of designer support: 1) creating a shared context, and 2) facilitating online communication and knowledge construction. Examples of these two aspects of support are presented along a continuum ranging from technology that simply allows collaboration to collaborative technology that makes collaboration more accessible to users. Examples of strategies for creating a shared context include the use of metaphorical designs to graphically represent the virtual environment for intuitive navigation and role transplantation, the use of informational support for decision-making, and the use of multiple information channels and tools to support coordinated collaboration in task-based projects. In order to facilitate online communication and knowledge construction, on the other hand, designers can employ communication scaffolds to structure online communication and artifacts as shared representations that provide contexts for online discussions. Finally, the potential application of similar mechanisms to online course management systems is discussed.

AB  - Assumptive Learning Theory values the active process of linking concepts to promote meaningful over rote learning. To promote meaningful learning, assessment practices that encourage the linking of concepts need to be developed and utilized. Creative Exercises (CEs) have the potential to encourage such links. CEs are an open-ended assessment technique where students are given a single prompt and are asked to describe as many statements as they can that are distinct, correct, and relevant to the prompt. This study describes a qualitative investigation into student responses to CEs for evidence of students linking concepts throughout the course and the nature of the linked concepts. The findings indicate considerable interconnections of content in student responses. Further, students' efforts toward making connections revealed several misconceptions regarding their understanding of the limits of models. CEs are therefore proposed as a means to encourage students to link concepts and to inform instructors about the links made, both correctly and incorrectly. Finally, to determine the prevalence of the incorrect links, a novel assessment technique is proposed based on students' responses to CEs.

The competitive advantage in the field of critical knowledge and technology exacerbates the problem of the effectiveness of intellectual activity and the means of its support in science, production and education. Such visual aids, formed by conceptual and graphic elements, such as concept maps, frames, structural logic diagrams, etc., contribute to the theoretical analysis and generalisation of the formed images and representations of learners. According to the degree of the development of these visual aids, the emphasis shifts from the function of visibility to the function of the organisation of activities. The term "visibility" (associated with the initial images of perception and representation) is substituted by the term "regulator" (focused on the organisation of further activities of the student). The hypothesis assumes the expediency of the development of conceptual and graphic means of visualisation in the form of visual didactic regulations, which are the subject of research.
   The present research aims: to discuss the problem of the creation of didactic regulations for educational activities; to study the development of conceptual-graphic means of visibility and factors for improving their functionality; to forecast the development of this type of means based on the visualisation of the logical-semantic modelling of knowledge; to clarify terminology and applied aspects; and to conduct experimental approbation in the conditions of distance learning.
   Methodology and research methods. The research methodology is based on the fundamental didactic principle of visualisation, which is necessary for the transition in the process of cognition from sensory perception to abstract thinking and contributes to the combination of abstract thinking with visualisation in teaching. The research methodology is also based on the method of logical-semantic modelling of knowledge and the following criteria for the study of conceptual-graphic means of visualisation: the application of the cognitive principles of knowledge representation; the use of universal instructional analysis activities to transform knowledge; the applicability of graphical representation of content. The methodology for the formation of didactic regulations included a visual presentation of the results of logical-semantic modelling of knowledge using universal educational actions and coordinate-matrix graphics. The method of experimental approbation of regulations in distance learning involved: the participation of students of four specialities and university teachers; a questionnaire survey of students; mastering, designing and using didactic regulations on the topic of experimental studies.
   Results and scientific novelty. The search on the databases of scientific documents of the Russian Academy of Education, the Electronic Scientific Library, Scopus, WOS and the Internet revealed the apparent lack of research and development of didactic regulations of a conceptual-graphic type. It was established that the main reason for the development of conceptual and graphic means of visualisation is the complexity of the tasks to be solved in science, production and education. It is demonstrated that the improvement of the functionality of conceptual and graphical tools is explained by the application of the principles of cognitive visual representation of knowledge and the method of logical-semantic modelling. The basic structures of the regulations were predicted and formed; the terminology of the research approach was clarified; the application of the tools for educational and project-based activities, interfaces of computer training programs is considered.
   Practical significance. The functionality of visual didactic regulators expands the potential of visibility and complements the tools of the teacher and the student. Moreover, they can be used in teaching technologies, research activities and design, when creating computer training programs.

AB  - The research literature reports on designs of ubiquitous and seamless learning environments enabled by the integration of mobile technology into learning. However, the lack of good pedagogical designs that provide for sustainability and the inadequate investigation of learning outcomes remain major gaps in the current studies on mobile learning. This paper seeks to contribute to addressing these issues by reporting on a study concerning the principles of integrating mobile learning into a standards-based science curriculum. It also explores how mobile learning activities have impacted students' academic and activity performances in and out of the classroom over a whole academic year. Mixed methods were used to examine students' performances, and a yearly comparison was made for assessing students' progression in their conceptual understanding in science. Data analysis on students' test results, mobile learning artifacts, and their activity performances in the classroom suggested that they had improved in their conceptual understanding and self-reflection on these conceptual changes. Students were engaged in mobile learning activities both in the classroom and out of the classroom through sustained exposure to and experience of the mobilized science curriculum.

AB  - This article seeks to analyse the current state of scientific knowledge concerning critical thinking in nursing. The methodology used consisted of a scoping review of the main scientific databases using an applied search strategy. A total of 1518 studies published from January 1999 to June 2013 were identified, of which 90 met the inclusion criteria. The main conclusion drawn is that critical thinking in nursing is experiencing a growing interest in the study of both its concepts and its dimensions, as well as in the development of training strategies to further its development among both students and professionals. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that critical thinking has been investigated principally in the university setting, independent of conceptual models, with a variety of instruments used for its measurement. We recommend (i) the investigation of critical thinking among working professionals, (ii) the designing of evaluative instruments linked to conceptual models and (iii) the identification of strategies to promote critical thinking in the context of providing nursing care.

AB  - Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) trade deep and intimate tutor-tutee interactions for large-scale coverage of educational lectures. Therefore, a proper length of student-assistant discussion is particularly precious both for the questioner and the observers in MOOC communities. To investigate the concept conveying characteristics of long and short discussions, this paper collected 32 student-assistant discussion transcripts in MOOC communities. Each discussion thread was randomly chosen in one course. Besides, 32 questions-and-answers (Q&A) transcripts in different science lectures and 31 Q&A transcripts in different press briefings were collected as comparison groups. The nouns in these transcripts were extracted as concepts, and the concept conveying procedure was modelled into a directed graph. We found that if an assistant would like to prolong the discussion in MOOC communities, he or she needs to retain concepts closely connected like political spokesmen on press briefings, and apply properly deep concepts like senior scientists on science lectures.

TI  - Collaborative diagramming during problem based learning in medical education: Do computerized diagrams support basic science knowledge construction?
T2  - MEDICAL TEACHER
KW  - CONCEPT MAPS
KW  - STRATEGY
AB  - Aim: To examine how collaborative diagramming affects discussion and knowledge construction when learning complex basic science topics in medical education, including its effectiveness in the reformulation phase of problem-based learning.
   Methods: Opinions and perceptions of students (n = 70) and tutors (n = 4) who used collaborative diagramming in tutorial groups were collected with a questionnaire and focus group discussions. A framework derived from the analysis of discourse in computer-supported collaborative leaning was used to construct the questionnaire. Video observations were used during the focus group discussions.
   Results: Both students and tutors felt that collaborative diagramming positively affected discussion and knowledge construction. Students particularly appreciated that diagrams helped them to structure knowledge, to develop an overview of topics, and stimulated them to find relationships between topics. Tutors emphasized that diagramming increased interaction and enhanced the focus and detail of the discussion. Favourable conditions were the following: working with a shared whiteboard, using a diagram format that facilitated distribution, and applying half filled-in diagrams for non-content expert tutors and\or for heterogeneous groups with low achieving students.
   Conclusion: The empirical findings in this study support the findings of earlier more descriptive studies that diagramming in a collaborative setting is valuable for learning complex knowledge in medicine.

AB  - Context-aware ubiquitous learning has been recognized as being a promising approach that enables students to interact with real-world learning targets with supports from the digital world. Several researchers have indicated the importance of providing learning guidance or hints to individual students during the context-aware ubiquitous learning process. In this study, an expert system-based guidance approach is proposed for conducting effective context-aware ubiquitous learning activities based on the domain knowledge provided by experienced teachers. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment on a learning activity in a senior high school Geosciences course has been conducted. The experimental results show that, with this new approach, the students' learning achievements have been significantly improved in terms of several cognitive processes in Bloom's taxonomy of educational objectives, such as "analyzing" and "evaluating." Consequently, it is concluded that the context-aware ubiquitous learning system with the interactive guiding approach has benefited the students in enhancing their higher order thinking competences.

   Methods. This study correlated student engagement with the flipped classroom and student disposition to learning with student ability to solve novel scenarios in examinations.
   Results. Students who both prepared for and attended classes performed significantly better on examination questions that required analysis of novel scenarios compared to students who did not prepare and missed classes. However, there was no difference for both groups of students on examination questions that required knowledge and comprehension. Student motivation and use of strategies correlated with higher examination scores on questions requiring novel scenario analysis.
   Conclusion. There is a synergistic relationship between class preparation and attendance. The combination of preparation and attendance was positively correlated to assessment type; the relationship was apparent for questions requiring students to solve novel problems but not for questions requiring knowledge or comprehension.

AB  - This paper presents teachers' perspectives and experiences with the implementation of formative assessment (FA) into chemistry lessons at the secondary school level through Formative Assessment Classroom Techniques (FACTs). The research had a qualitative character and was based on semistructured interviews focused on: the definition and previous use of FA, implementation experience, and teachers' beliefs, attitudes, and abilities. The research describes five cases?chemistry teachers participating in a professional development program. The 2 year-long training was focused on the theory of FA, practical exercises, and extended support during in-school FACTs implementation. The results showed that using FACTs during secondary school chemistry lessons emphasizes students' strengths and weaknesses, encourages them to perform truthful self-assessments, and engages them. Moreover, using FACTs opens new areas for parents' involvement in the assessment and learning process that can be especially valuable for students with special educational needs. The main challenges cited by teachers were time management, policy support, and the need for further assistance during FACTs implementation.

AB  - This study investigated the effects of metaconceptually-enhanced, simulation-based inquiry learning on eighth grade students' conceptual change in science and their development of science epistemic beliefs. Two experimental groups studied the topics of motion and force using the same computer simulations but with different simulation guides: one enhanced with metaconceptual scaffolding, while the other was not. The findings led to the following conclusions: (a) metaconceptual scaffolding enhanced simulation-based learning by significantly reducing science misconceptions, but it was not as effective in changing students' mental models which consisted of multiple interrelated key concepts; (b) students' beliefs about the speed of learning and the construction of knowledge were strong predictors of conceptual change learning outcomes; (c) epistemologically more mature students did not benefit more from metaconceptual interventions than those with less mature beliefs; (d) further interventions are needed to promote the development of students' science epistemic beliefs in inquiry learning.

AB  - Science teaching requires finding multiple ways to supply not only hard facts but also complementary knowledge to provide the students with all necessary elements to become under the process not only scientists but also socially competent individuals[1]. One way to illustrate the relationships between different sets of concepts such as biochemistry and environment or structure and function is by using conceptual maps, which may be useful for teaching, evaluation and design of study programs [2, 3]. Conceptual maps may be quite diverse since they correspond to graphic representations originated from common objectives with individual perceptions. The most important parameters are rationality and usefulness to the particular teacher and student working with these models.
   With the purpose of evaluating the feasibility of conceptual maps as teaching strategy in Biochemistry, we have first located the Cell and Tissue First Biochemistry Course (BCT-I) in the overall context of the Pharmacy Study Plan. Secondly, teachers have started to show the unit content at the beginning of each unit whereas the students elaborate individual conceptual maps consistent with what they expect to study during the corresponding unit. Thirdly, every student individually will prepare a conceptual map from the whole course when the course is completed and compare it to the maps that they conceived at the beginning of every unit.
   Thus far, we have created the conceptual BCT-1 map containing several parts dealing with topics such as cell, water, biomolecules, sugar and lipid metabolism and routines for evaluation of biochemistry subjects. The second and third parts are in process but we can already foresee their usefulness. Earlier methods based only on gathering of information are no longer sufficient in our constantly evolving modern environment. It is necessary to develop social skills and to acquire knowledge on different subjects to achieve the integration of contemporary social, economical and environmental facts and needs. An improved education quality with more and better educational tools such as conceptual maps may help to obtain more effective teaching and learning of biochemistry.

AB  - In this investigation, we analyzed the processes of knowing and interacting in an open-inquiry learning environment that was planned and implemented by teachers who used the metaphor of cognitive apprenticeship as a referent.  Based on detailed analyses of students' conversations, we documented the construction of and changes in Grade 8 students' understandings as they engaged in inquiries for which they planned focus questions, designed data collection procedures, and interpreted the findings.  Through their interactions, the students also arrived at private meanings that they did not report in their findings and that were often overlooked by teachers who used static end-of-unit tests to measure student learning.  In conducting their inquiries, students successfully negotiated courses of actions and established group structures through which they organized their interactions.  Formal and informal interactions between students and research groups facilitated the formation of networks that contributed to the quick diffusion of knowledge necessary in the construction of a community of knowers.  Each of these analytic dimensions is amply documented by data from the observed classrooms.  Classroom implications of the findings are discussed.

AB  - The current systematic review aimed to investigatein what ways the incorporation of visual display tasks benefits K-12 students' content-area learning. After screening 1693 articles at abstract level and a systematic evaluation of methodological quality, we synthesized 44 articles for this review. The qualitative synthesis of the studies is organized by categories of interaction with visual displays (ViDis), instructional support, and types of knowledge and learning. Overall findings indicate the simple inclusion of visual displays does not guarantee a positive learning effect. More detailed findings distinguish three categories of ViDis: author-provided, student-filled-in, and student-created visual displays. Furthermore, we discuss each category's effectiveness for students' learning. Additionally, findings on retention and information comprehension are mixed when students are either provided with ViDis or complete ViDis themselves. However, the integration of ViDis in K-12 classrooms indicate highly promising results for enhancing students' higher-level learning (i.e., analyzing, evaluating, applying, and creating). Finally, we provided practical implications for K-12 teachers and recommendations for future research.

AB  - Formative assessment (FA) is considered a powerful tool to enhance learning. However, there have been few studies addressing how the implementation of FA influences the development of inquiry skills so far. This research intends to determine the efficacy of teaching using FA in the development of students' inquiry skills. A test of inquiry skills was used as the main research instrument to identify the level of the selected inquiry skills before and after a period of teaching with or without FA in the experimental and control group respectively. In the experimental group (n=73), FA was implemented across five subjects: biology, chemistry, physics, mathematics, and informatics, while the control group (n=48) was taught without any external intervention. In both groups, mostly teacher-centred methods of teaching were applied. The research findings confirmed a low initial level of inquiry skills. Teaching using FA showed higher efficacy than teaching without FA, even without a special focus on the inquiry methods. The experimental group achieved significantly better results compared to the control group. In addition, the results confirmed higher efficacy of FA in lower performing students. Gender did not prove as a determining factor in the effective implementation of FA.

AB  - Using drawings and accompanying written and oral explanations by third- and sixth-grade students, this phenomenological study is an examination of the children's perception of the ideal environmental school. Analysis of the 128 features in the drawing yielded four categories: (1) physical - with natural areas and outdoor learning, (2) cognitive core subjects and environmental ones, (3) emotional the students' feelings and the spaces for releasing stress and energy and (4) educational environmental education (EE) includes a variety of pedagogies, features of nature and environmental solutions. While the drawings and explanations presented the school as the children know it, without boundary-breaking imagination and creativity, they also showed a desire for a positive school atmosphere, defined as essential to holistic EE and to leading environmental change. The positive atmosphere, nature and the environmental spaces can be the foundation of developing EE that is not fear based, which often generates helplessness and prevents action. The recommendations emphasise the need to enhance positive thinking and not to focus only on fear tactics as a means to enhance holistic EE and protect the environment.

AB  - Peer assessment strategy has been noted as an effectiveness learning strategy for students to construct their knowledge during the process of evaluating peers' work. Moreover, this effective learning strategy further benefits teaching reality of the schools. In order to engage students to have more in-deep thinking during peer assessment activity, a peer-assessment criteria development approach conducting with mobile device for students is developed. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, an experiment was conducted in an art course with 103 students in an elementary school in northern Taiwan. Those students were assigned into an experimental group and a control group, which the experimental group learned with the proposed approach; while the control group learned with a conventional peer assessment approach. The experimental results showed that the critical thinking ability of the students in the experimental group was significantly better than those in the control group, showing the effectiveness of the proposed approach

AB  - The purpose of this study was dual: First, to develop and validate assessment schemes for assessing 11th grade students' meaningful understanding of organic chemistry concepts, as well as their systems thinking skills in the domain. Second, to explore the relationship between the two constructs of interest based on students' performance on the applied assessment framework. For this purpose, (a) various types of objective assessment questions were developed and evaluated for assessing meaningful understanding, (b) a specific type of systemic assessment questions (SAQs) was developed and evaluated for assessing systems thinking skills, and (c) the association between students' responses on the applied assessment schemes was explored. The results indicated that properly designed objective questions can effectively capture aspects of students' meaningful understanding. It was also found that the SAQs can elicit systems thinking skills in the context of a formalistic systems thinking theoretical approach. Moreover, a significant relationship was observed between students' responses on the two assessment strategies. This research provides evidence that students' systems thinking level within a science domain is significantly related to their meaningful understanding of relative science concepts.

AB  - Discovering the most suitable network structure of the learning domain represents one of the main challenges of knowledge delivery and acquisition. We propose a multidimensional knowledge network (MKN) consisting of three components: multilayer network and its two projections. Each network layer constitutes factual, conceptual, procedural, or metacognitive knowledge within the domain of databases as a standard course of computer science study. In the MKN layer, nodes are concepts or knowledge units and the edges are weighted with regard to Bloom's cognitive learning level. The projected network layers are contrasted with a monolayer network by comparing characterizations of the centrality measures: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eccentricity. The study revealed indications of how concepts, supported with the higher number of previously introduced concepts, have a dominant role in knowledge acquisition, from a view of knowledge structure and content. The analysis of communities, assortativity coefficient, and overlap between MKN layers contributes to better structuring of knowledge. MKN enables systematic insights into the efficiency of knowledge integration across metacognitive layers, as well as the detection of crucial cognitive concepts that reduce/increase the cognitive load during learning.

AB  - Objective: To evaluate the effectiveness of teaching strategies used for development of critical thinking (CT) in undergraduate nursing students. Method: Systematic review with meta-analysis based on the recommendations of the Joanna Briggs Institute. Searches were conducted in the following databases: PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS, LILACS, Cochrane CENTRAL, PsycINFO, ERIC, and a database of theses from four continents. The initial selection and evaluation of studies and assessment of methodological quality was performed by two reviewers independently. Results: Twelve randomized clinical trials were included in the study. In the meta-analysis of the four studies included that evaluated the strategy of problem-based learning (PBL), compared to lectures, the effectiveness of PBL was demonstrated with statistical significance (SMD = 0.21 and 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.42; p = 0.0434) for the development of CT in undergraduate nursing students, and the studies were homogeneous (chi-square = 6.10, p = 0.106). Conclusion: The effectiveness of PBL was demonstrated in the increase of overall CT scores. Further studies need to be conducted in order to develop, implement and evaluate teaching strategies that are guided in high methodological rigor, and supported in theoretical models of teaching and learning.

AB  - In this study, an integrated gaming and multistage guiding approach was proposed for conducting in-field mobile learning activities. A mobile learning system was developed based on the proposed approach. To investigate the interaction between the gaming and guiding strategies on students' learning performance and motivation, a 2x2 experiment was conducted on an elementary school natural science course. Four groups of students were situated in a field trip to learn with different mobile learning approaches (ie, gaming or nongaming) and guiding mechanisms (ie, multistage or single-stage). The experimental results showed that both the gaming and multistage guiding mechanisms proposed in this study significantly enhanced the students' learning achievements. Moreover, the interaction between the two showed that the lead-in of the gaming strategy could significantly improve the learning motivation of the students who learned with the multistage guiding mechanism; on the contrary, their learning motivation could be significantly decreased without the gaming approach, although the multistage guiding mechanism was effective. The findings imply that gamification could be a good approach for helping students accept learning support or tools provided in mobile learning scenarios.

AB  - Higher education for sustainable development (HESD) has grown into a substantial field of research and practice. HESD proposes that higher education will be central in a transition towards more sustainable socio-ecological systems. However, the debates on what should be learned in HESD and how this should be learned have remained conceptually controversial and empirically inconclusive. This review examined the evidence that specific pedagogies and content lead to specific "sustainability outcomes" among graduates. Three hundred and fifty-seven studies published between 2013 and 2020 were analyzed. The reviewed research was case-driven and often undertheorized regarding learning processes and outcomes. Despite its volume, the literature did not provide coherent insights into what should be learned and how. If the project of HESD is to be pursued further, more courage will be needed in creating novel forms of higher education, while more purpose and conceptual precision will be required in future research.

AB  - Objectives Brain health is an important focus for coming decades due to population ageing. Although the term 'brain health' is increasingly used in lay and professional settings, a clear definition of the term is lacking. We conducted an analysis of the concept of brain health to inform policy, practice, and research.
   Methods We applied a hybrid concept analysis method involving three stages: (1) a review of the extant literature for definitions of brain health; (2) field work, involving an international survey of 'brain health' researchers and practitioners; and (3) a final analysis, integrating the findings into a working definition and model.
   Results Our review of the literature identified 13 articles defining brain health, six of which proposed their own definition. Our survey revealed that the term 'brain health' was used in diverse ways based on different theoretical frameworks. From the review and survey, we extracted attributes, antecedents, and consequences of brain health. These were synthesized into a definition of brain health as a life-long, multidimensional, dynamic state consisting of cognitive, emotional and motor domains underpinned by physiological processes and can be objectively measured and subjectively experienced. It is influenced by eco-biopsychosocial determinants.
   Conclusion This working definition of brain health is a foundation for developing policy, practice, research and advocacy. The definition needs to be operationalised through further development of empirical referents, including cross-cultural understanding, adaptation and validation.

AB  - Cognitive scientists investigate mental models (how humans organize and structure knowledge in their minds) so as to understand human understanding of and interactions with the world. Cognitive and mental model research is concerned with internal conceptual systems that are not easily or directly observable. The goal of this research was to investigate the use of Evaluation of Mental Models (EMM) to assess the mental models of individuals and groups in solving complex problems and to compare novices and experts models as bases for providing feedback to learners. This study tested a qualified web-based assessment tool kit, Highly Interactive Model-based Assessment Tools and Technologies (HIMATT), in an as yet untested domain-mathematics. In this study, university students and their mathematics instructors used two tools in HIMATT, Dynamic Evaluation of Enhanced Problem Solving (DEEP) and Text-Model Inspection Trace of Concepts and Relations (T-MITOCAR). The research questions include: Do novice participants exhibit common patterns of thoughts when they conceptualize complex mathematical problems? Do novices conceptualize complex mathematical problems differently from experts? What differences in DEEP and T-MITOCAR patterns and responses exist according to the measures of HIMATT? Findings suggest that EMM and HIMATT could effectively support formative assessment in a complex mathematical domain. Finally, this study confirms a common assumption of cognitive scientists that the tool being used could affect the tool user's understanding of the problem being solved. In this case, while DEEP and T-MITOCAR led to somewhat different expert models, both tools prove useful in support of formative assessment.

Studies published in peer-reviewed journals from January 2001 to December 2014 were searched using electronic databases and major education journals. A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.2. Reviewing the included studies, the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory (CCTDI) and California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) were used to assess the effectiveness of critical thinking in the meta-analysis.
   Results: The eight CCTDI datasets showed that non-traditional teaching methods (i.e., no lectures) were more effective compared to control groups (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.42, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-0.57, p < .00001). And six CCTST datasets showed the teaching and learning methods in these studies were also had significantly more effects when compared to the control groups (SMD: 0.29, 95 % CI: 0.10-0.48, p = 0.003).
   Conclusions: This research showed that new teaching and learning methods designed to improve critical thinking were generally effective at enhancing critical thinking dispositions.

AB  - We propose a high school level method of study of the harmonic oscillations using two free of charge software. This method can be useful for understanding and learning of the concepts and physical notions involved in the oscillatory movement. The first software is Cmap Tools, a free application used for creating the conceptual maps. These are very useful instruments in establishing hierarchies between physical measures and to create causality connections between them. The assembly of a conceptual map involves a good knowledge of the phenomenon and therefore leads to a conceptualization of the given notions. The conceptual map can be used as an instrument for presenting the information for both teaching and evaluation stages. Another instrument is the open -source program called Tracker. With its help, different filmed oscillatory movements can be tracked. With Tracker software, we can calculate specific physical quantities, while analyzing the body movements, modelling the obtained experimental data and plotting associated graphics. By observing the movements produced by laboratory devices and the oscillatory movements from daily life and shaping the collected data by Tracker software, we can compare the real and ideal motion, we can draw conclusions that can lead to the clarification of the studied physical concepts and the connections between them.

AB  - The transition from traditional classroom teaching to online learning leads to new teaching and learning paradigms. Changes in philosophical points of view about education need new teaching tools and learning options that convert the student into a self-directed learner and a critical thinker. This paper presents the teaching tools and strategies developed and tested during a three years blended learning experience for pharmacology and veterinary therapeutics students.
   During the b-learning course, students assist to traditional classroom and furthermore they can access to the "Virtual Classroom of Pharmacology" through the Campus Virtual of the Complutense University. The learning tools incorporated to the Virtual Classroom consist in workshops and discussion forums that are lean on shared tutorial support sessions.
   Each established teaching tool is based on different learning strategies and is designed to improve a variety of student capacities: on-line forums and workshops (pharmacological "sheets", games, test makers and solvers). Furthermore, at present, two new tools (wikis and conceptual maps) are being incorporated.
   The main limitations of this study are two: we have not be able to demonstrate that the learning and teaching tools and strategies used actually improved the acquisition of pharmacological or therapeutic knowledge and we cannot know how this b-learning experience would evolving when it were available for a bigger student group.

AB  - Mobile learning has been recommended for motivating students on field trips; nevertheless, owing to the complexity and the richness of the learning resources from both the real-world and the digital-world environments, information overload remains one of the major concerns. Most mobile learning designs provide feedback only for multiple choice items to guide students' learning. The aim of this study was to develop a series of worksheets as scaffolding to support inquiry-based ecology observations in a mobile learning environment. Based on a three-layer worksheet framework, a mobile learning system with in-field scoring rubrics was developed to guide the students to sequentially focus on guided observations, independent observations, and extended inquiries. Well-designed worksheets, instant feedback and supplementary materials were provided to balance the students' learning pressure and task challenge in the species-rich field. The automated scoring data for constructed response tasks were analyzed to investigate the learning growth and students' learning characteristics. The results showed that the proposed approach was effective in improving the field observation performance of the students. Furthermore, nearly 70% of the students who learned with the proposed approach could pursue their own inquiries in the mobile learning environment, showing that the approach is promising.

AB  - This paper deals with the use of videos in education and describes an approach to improve the learners' experience in the first-watch and rewatch learning contexts. Actually, learning through videos raises challenging issues like non-linear navigation and poor structure of the video content. Hence, a novel application is presented, designed to address such issues. To this aim, the proposed Edurell environment enriches standard video lessons with new services based on the contents' structure of the video, resulting in a new hypervideo educational application. The system extracts the concepts explained in a given video lesson, their prerequisite relations, and the segments of the video where they occur, together with other pieces of knowledge. The resulting knowledge graph allows creating augmented video lessons and enables learners to perform non-linear navigation and in-depth exploration of their learning contents. This idea was implemented in a custom web-based video player with interactive visual tools. Then, a heuristic usability evaluation was performed with HCI experts. Also, a user study with university students was done, aimed to evaluate the perceived usability and the student's experience in the two mentioned learning contexts. The first results achieved show the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

AB  - The representation of knowledge is a process widely used in education for its potential to generate deep learning, metacognition, and also in mapping the student's cognitive structure while developing a broad spectrum of thinking skills. Notwithstanding the abovementioned benefits, the development and evolution of new digital ecologies of learning is still an unexplored field for knowledge representation systems. As part of a larger study, this article shows the process and results of a systematic review of literature on knowledge representation systems, with the purpose of identifying the foundations and main applicable instruments of digital educational environments. Among the most representative findings of this review is that despite the existence of a large number of educational experiences that have incorporated both physical and digital knowledge representation tools, their use has been restricted almost entirely to the understanding of concepts and the assessment of learning in non-collaborative environments. These findings suggest the relevance of studying the representation of knowledge in digital collaborative contexts that facilitate the development of thinking skills for the digital age, and the need for co-creation and transformation of knowledge. Together these suggest a new perspective on knowledge representation for digital ecologies of learning.

AB  - Projects have been conceived and have been realized and advanced, as part of the planned activities of an innovative italian educational project, called school-work, with the financial support of MIUR. The activities have been targeted in order to enhance Biology learning of a class of 20-25 High School students of 16-17 years old.
   For cultivating a welcoming, inclusive classroom environment, one of the simplest strategies I used has been to structure and achieve ways to get to know and call students by their names.
   If learning requires that students construct ideas for themselves, then demanding the active participation of every single student in a class is essential to learning because every student in the classroom is an important part of the learning process..
   Applying a simple teaching strategy "wait time" for student thinking in order to expand the number of students participating verbally in a biology classroom after asking a question, to give students time to think and talk about biology. In this line I experimented a simple way to increase waiting time and promote student engagement, and participation by obtaining an increases in the length and complexity of the answers that volunteer students have given in replay to a particular question: I used a chalkboard and chalk to write the volunteers' answers.
   The use of open-ended questions, which are those questions, having multiple possible response, that cannot be answered with a simple "yes" or "no" or even easily answered with a single word or phrase such that inviting answers from a large group can yield more than an expected set of response can be posed orally to frame a class discussion and followed by a quick write or pair discussion to give students time to consider their responses.
   I posed Open-ended questions orally to frame a class discussion followed by a quick write or pair discussion to give students time to consider their responses. Alternatively, I have planned these questions in advance, so they could be given as brief homework assignments, allowing students time to consider the questions before coming to class. In some ways, training in asking closed-ended, experimental questions may be at odds with developing skills in open-ended questioning.
   I used a variety of active-learning strategies from class session to class session. For each strategy, some students have been in their confort zone and other have been out of their comfort zones. In particular students who may be more reflective in their learning may be most comfortable during reflective writing or thinking about a clicker question. Other students may prefer learning by talking with peers after a clicker question or in a whole class conversation. Still others may prefer the opportunity to evaluate animations and videos or represent their understanding of biology in more visual ways through drawing, concept mapping, or diagramming. One might ask which of these different strategies is the most effective way to teach a given topic, yet this question belies the likely importance of variations in the efficacy of different strategies with different students. There may not ever be a "best" way to teach a particular concept, given the diversity of students in any given classroom.
   Most topics in biology can be connected in some way to the lived experiences of students, such as connecting what can be an abstract process of how genes produce fenotipes to the very real and immediate example of the bitter taste.

AB  - Assessment in many Central- and Eastern-European countries is dominated by summative assessment (SA). Simultaneously, researchers and educators from western Europe and the US proclaim the formative assessment (FA) as an important element of the educational process and advise including it into curricula and everyday teachers' practice. The research presented herein reports an introduction of formative assessment classroom techniques (FACTs) during chemistry lessons at K7 level in Slovakia. In total 202 students participated in the research. They were divided randomly into a control (n=97) and an experimental (n=105) group, and the intervention covered 10 successive lessons. After the intervention, the student's outcomes were compared using the test checking student's knowledge and skills according to various domains of Bloom's revised taxonomy. The results suggested a statistically significant increase in the score of the experimental group, and a detailed analysis revealed that the increase was significant in both lower- and higher-order cognitive skills area. Finally, the students' reaction on the introduction of formative assessment was studied and showed their positive attitude towards the introduced method.

AB  - In physics teacher education, two central goals are first to learn the structures of physics knowledge, and second the processes of its construction. To know the structure is to know the framework of concepts and laws; to know the processes is to know where the knowledge comes from, how the framework is constructed, and how it can be justified. This article introduces a way to approach these goals in the form of a graphical tool called the didactical reconstruction of processes (DRP), where knowledge is constructed to the extent that experiments and models have an equally important role in the construction process. In practice, the DRP is a graphical network representation or a 'flow chart' with a specific structure, which aims to give an image of the processes of physical concept formation, while at the same time bearing in mind the educational goals. The DRP was tested in an instruction unit for pre-service physics teachers, where students drew flow charts for representing how the law of electromagnetic induction is formed. In addition to flow charts, students also wrote essays clarifying the content of the flow charts. The flow charts and essays were analysed through a qualitative categorisation of structural and knowledge claim patterns. The results show that the DRP helps students in arguing how to form the electromagnetic induction law and that the experiments and models have a distinct role in supporting students' knowledge claims.

AB  - Management education holds promise for addressing deficiencies in interuniversity science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), as well as sustainability curricula. Accordingly, we designed, developed, implemented, and longitudinally evaluated interdisciplinary STEM-based curricula in the United States. Students in five sections of business management courses and two sections of STEM courses received a STEM-based sustainability intervention (i.e., an interdisciplinary STEM and sustainability module). To assess student outcomes following the intervention and examine the feasibility of cognitive mapping as a student learning assessment tool, we implemented a pre- and post-course modified cognitive mapping assessment in treatment and comparison courses. To interpret the results, we ran descriptives, correlations, paired sample t tests, and principal component analysis. The t tests suggest that when all coding categories are considered, those participating in curricular interventions listed significantly more sustainability terms. The principal component analysis results demonstrate that treatment courses improved variability explained by 7.23% between pre- and post-tests but declined by 8.22% for comparison courses. Overall, linkages became stronger between parent code categories for treatment courses and weaker for comparison courses. These findings add to existing research related to cognitive mapping and demonstrate the ability of the method to capture changes in student outcomes after exposure to STEM-based sustainability curriculum.

AB  - In three experiments, students were trained to use strategies for learning from scientific texts: text highlighting (Experiment 1), knowledge mapping (Experiment 2), and visualizing (Experiment 3). Each experiment compared a control condition, cognitive strategy training, and a combined cognitive strategy plus metacognitive self-regulation training with a specific focus on the quality of cognitive strategy application. After the training, students applied the learning strategies as they studied scientific texts. Across experiments, the results indicated that the self-regulation component of the training helped the students to overcome the lack of efficacy of the cognitive strategy only training when it was not effective by itself: The highlighting-only group was outperformed by the control group (d = -1.25), but the combined highlighting-plus-self-regulation training reduced this negative effect (d = -0.21). The mapping-only group performed as well as the control group (d = -0.12), but the combined mapping-plus-self-regulation group outperformed the control group (d = 0.76). The visualizing-only group outperformed the control group (d = 0.72) as did the combined visualizing-plus-self-regulation group (d = 0.78). Results suggest that cognitive learning strategies differ in their potential to induce deep versus surface processing of text contents. In addition, the metacognitive self-regulation component of the training enhanced students' performance when the cognitive strategy training was not effective by itself.

AB  - This study constructed the EIA (Experience-Inquiry-Application) model to evaluate its extent on promoting scientific inquiry activities under an AR learning environment in an upper primary science course setting. Two hundred and nine fifth-grade Chinese students were randomly assigned to one of the three conditions, as a quasi-experiment was conducted to investigate how the EIA model and the AR learning environment influence students' science learning. Both quantitative and qualitative data were collected. Quantitative data suggest that students who participated in the EIA model under the AR setting performed the best; it also gives evidence to support that both the EIA model and the AR environment has significant positive effects on students' performance in science learning. Qualitative data, in the form of a semi-structured interview with teachers and students, reveal that AR is able to be used for experiments that were originally deemed impossible, and it inspires students' motivation for knowledge acquisition. Moreover, the EIA model empowers students in small-group collaboration, and is a good pedagogical tool to summarize units. EIA and AR form a bond of theory and technology and it strengthens students in manifold ways when it is deeply interwoven.

AB  - Immunology is a fascinating and extremely complex field, with natural connections to many disciplines both within STEM and beyond. Teaching an undergraduate course in immunology therefore provides both opportunities and challenges. Significant challenges to student learning include mastering the volume of new vocabulary and figuring out how to think coherently about a physiological system that is so anatomically disseminated. More importantly, teaching immunology can be complicated because it requires students to integrate knowledge derived from prior introductory courses in a range of fields, including cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy and genetics. However, this also provides an opportunity to use the study of the immune system as a platform on which students can assemble and integrate foundational STEM knowledge, while also learning about a new and exciting field. Pedagogical theory has taught us that students learn best by engaging with complicated questions and by thinking metacognitively about how to approach solutions. Building this skill set in today's students, who now hail from a broad demographic and who are accustomed to acquiring their knowledge from a variety of different media, requires a new set of teaching tools. Using perspectives from four different immunology educators, we describe a range of student-centered, active learning approaches that have been field-tested in a number of different immunology classrooms and that are geared to a variety of learning styles. In this paper, we explore the hypothesis that active learning approaches to immunology improve comprehension and retention by increasing student engagement in class and their subsequent mastery of complex topics.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the impact of mobile learning among young learners. Specifically, we investigated whether the use of mobile devices for data collection during field trips outside the classroom could enhance fourth graders' learning about the parts of the flower and their functions, flower pollinators and the process of pollination/fertilization, and the interrelationship between animals and plants, more than students' use of traditional means of data collection. For this purpose, we designed a pre-post experimental design study with two conditions: one in which participants used a mobile device for data collection and another using traditional means (e.g. sketching and note-taking). The sample comprised 48 fourth graders (24 in each condition), who studied the flower, its parts, and their functions. A conceptual test was administered to assess students' understanding before and after instruction. Moreover, the students' science notebooks and accompanying artifacts were used as a data source for examining students' progress during the study's intervention. The conceptual test and notebook data were analyzed statistically, whereas we used open coding for the artifacts. Findings revealed that using mobile devices for data collection enhanced students' conceptual understanding more than using traditional means of data collection.

AB  - In 2006 a new type of tutorial, called Map Meeting, was successfully trialled with novice first year physics students at the University of Sydney, Australia. Subsequently, in first semester 2007 a large-scale experiment was carried out with 262 students who were allocated either to the strongly scaffolding Map Meetings or to the less scaffolding Workshop Tutorials, which have been run at the University of Sydney since 1995. In this paper we describe what makes Map Meetings more scaffolding than Workshop Tutorials-where the level of scaffolding represents the main difference between the two tutorial types. Using a mixed methods approach to triangulate results, we compare the success of the two with respect to both student tutorial preference and examination performance. In summary, Map Meetings had a higher retention rate and received more positive feedback from students-students liked the strongly scaffolding environment and felt that it better helped them understand physics. A comparison of final examination performances of students who had attended at least 10 out of 12 tutorials revealed that only 11% of Map Meeting students received less than 30 out of 90 marks compared to 21% of Workshop Tutorial students, whereas there were no differences amongst high-achieving students. Map Meetings was therefore particularly successful in helping low-achieving novices learn physics.

AB  - CREATE (consider, mad, elucidate hypotheses, analyze and interpret the data, and think of the next experiment) is a new method for teaching science and the nature of science through primary literature. CREATE uses a unique combination of novel pedagogical tools to guide undergraduates through analysis of journal articles, highlighting the evolution of scientific ideas by focusing on a module of four articles from the same laboratory. Students become fluent in the universal language of data analysis as they decipher the figures, interpret the findings, and propose and defend further experiments to test their own hypotheses about the system under study. At the end of the course students gain insight into the individual experiences of article authors by reading authors' responses to an e-mail questionnaire generated by CREATE students. Assessment data indicate that CREATE students gain in ability to read and critically analyze scientific data, as well as in their understanding of, and interest in, research and researchers. The CREATE approach demystifies the process of reading a scientific article and at the same time humanizes scientists. The positive response of students to this method suggests that it could make a significant contribution to retaining undergraduates as science majors.

AB  - The present study considers the potential influence of first language (L1) in reading second language (L2) science text. University mixed proficiency Korean English language learners (n = 136) were asked to complete preand post-reading sorting maps in L1 or L2 (e.g., sort Korean, read text, sort English). All of the participants' pre-to-post sorting artifacts were then converted into Pathfinder Networks (PFnets), a graph-theoretic psychometric scaling approach, to represent the most salient knowledge structure (KS) as their situation model of the L2 text. For the low proficiency readers, the results show that when the L2 science text was reframed by the L2 post-reading sorting map, their L2 post-reading KS was more like their pre-reading KS, a linear L2 KS that had no significant correlation with the comprehension posttest. However, when the L2 science text was reframed by the L1 post-reading sorting map, their L1 post-reading KS was more like the L2 text base, which resulted in a relational KS that was more like the content expert and significantly correlated with the comprehension posttest. In contrast, the high proficiency readers post-reading KSs were like the L2 lesson text and their post-reading KSs were all relational in both languages.

AB  - This paper describes and compares two categories of pedagogical design patterns that have emerged from CS education practice: lecture-based design patterns and active learning design patterns. Pedagogical design patterns provide faculty with combinations of generalized descriptions of problems and solutions that occur in teaching and learning. The benefit of forming design patterns is the codification of successful practice that can be reused in multiple scenarios and draw on the creativity of the instructor for defining the details relevant to the course and the students. Design patterns have been represented in many formats since Alexander's initial design pattern model highlighting different aspects of what is important in each domain in which the patterns are created and used. This paper analyzes design patterns emerging from recent developments in lecture-based pedagogy and active learning in CS education. Traditional lectures in computer science, engineering, and other STEM disciplines are being reconsidered due to research that shows that students are less likely to learn while listening and more likely to learn while actively engaged. Design patterns that address problems and provide potential solutions to traditional lectures in computer science education have been published that provide solutions to engage students during the lecture. The pedagogy of flipped classrooms and active learning have recently been adopted by many faculty in Computer Science leading to emerging design patterns for active learning. We compare how previously published lecture-based patterns and our active learning patterns address similar problems with different solutions to engaging students. We show how an object-based structure for pedagogical design patterns can provide additional information about the problems and the solutions addressed by the patterns that are more easily indexed and combined.

AB  - Based on the flipped-classroom model and the potential motivational and instructional benefits of digital games, we describe a flipped game-based learning (FGBL) strategy focused on preclass and overall learning outcomes. A secondary goal is to determine the effects, if any, of the classroom aspects of the FGBL strategy on learning efficiency. Our experiments involved 2 commercial games featuring physical motion concepts: Ballance (Newton's law of motion) and Angry Birds (mechanical energy conservation). We randomly assigned 87 8th-grade students to game instruction (digital game before class and lecture-based instruction in class), FGBL strategy (digital game before class and cooperative learning in the form of group discussion and practice in class), or lecture-based instruction groups (no gameplay). Results indicate that the digital games exerted a positive effect on preclass learning outcomes and that FGBL-strategy students achieved better overall learning outcomes than their lecture-based peers. Our observation of similar overall outcomes between the cooperative learning and lecture-based groups suggests a need to provide additional teaching materials or technical support when introducing video games to cooperative classroom learning activities.

AB  - The exponential growth of scientific literature - which we call the big literature' phenomenon - has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge. In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research. Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research. Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.

AB  - Aim The aim of this study was to evaluate transfer of basic science knowledge for clinical application in our BDS programme by exploring the correlations between student performance in integrated dental science (IDS) examinations and applied dental knowledge (ADK) tests.
   Methods Numeric test scores were drawn from summative IDS and ADK assessments undertaken by BDS students spanning six academic years (2013-14 to 2018-19) for two cohorts (2013 and 2014). The data included a total of 13 test scores for each cohort with four IDS tests, taken in Years 1 and 2, and nine ADK tests taken in Years 3, 4 and 5.
   Results The sample included 120 students across both cohorts with 65 females (54%) and 55 males (46%). The correlation coefficients between the successive tests and the combinations of IDS and ADK scores were positive, all being greater than 0.48, and all being significantly correlated (P < .001). Regarding correlation between standardised averages across all IDS tests and all ADK tests, performance remained significantly correlated: (2013 cohort: r (53) = .667, P r (50) = .700, P < .001).
   Conclusions The results of this study show that the students' knowledge of basic sciences correlates with their applied dental knowledge and may offer a predictive value. These findings may be attributed to a PBL curriculum and student-led learning at our school.

AB  - Civil engineers are poised to impact sustainable development. Consequently, there is a need for curricular materials to scaffold students in developing sustainable design skills. Previously, a sustainability module, based on Kolb's learning cycle, was integrated into a civil engineering capstone course in the United States. The purpose of this study was to analyze the extent to which students engaging in the module (intervention cohort) were able to improve their sustainable design skills, as compared to a group of capstone students not participating in the module (control cohort). A Sustainable Design Rubric was used to assess students' sustainable design performance, as captured in capstone reports. In addition, students reflected on their confidence related to several sustainable design competencies via a survey. Based on an evaluation of capstone design reports, improvement in the intervention teams' consideration of sustainable design criteria was somewhat limited, as they more extensively addressed only 2 of the 16 sustainable design criteria compared to control teams. Intervention students reported improved confidence in more sustainable design competencies than control students (10 of 12 for intervention students; 1 of 12 for control students). For future implementations, clearer and more extensive sustainable design expectations need to be set by instructors and project sponsors to increase the execution of sustainable design and close the gap between students' perceptions of improved skills and teams' actual application of sustainable design criteria.

AB  - In this investigation, three classes of ninth-grade general science students participated in a collaborative report-writing intervention. The purpose of this portion of the study was to evaluate students' collaboratively written laboratory reports for evidence of the use of scientific reasoning skills and to document qualitative changes in reasoning skill use over time. The participants in the study were 6 ninth-grade students, representing three collaborative writing pairs. During the intervention, students wrote 10 laboratory reports over a 4.5-month period. The author and classroom teacher designed report guideline prompts to scaffold students in the use of relevant scientific reasoning skills. The results indicated that students used reasoning skills to assess their current models of scientific understanding, make observations, interpret the meaning of results, and generate new models based on their data and relevant information. Participants showed the most improvement in writing that reflected the reasoning skills of (a) selecting and processing textbook passages, (b) drawing conclusions and formulating models, and (c) comparing/contrasting. Over time, participants improved their ability to compose explanations that represented a synthesis of prior knowledge, activity observations, and other sources of information. Collaborative writing encouraged students to construct their own understandings of science concepts by creating an environment in which thinking, reasoning, and discussion were valued.

AB  - As the zebrafish is rapidly becoming a species of choice in preclinical research, several efforts are being placed toward creating educational programs for K-12 students based on this promising model organism. However, as any other model organisms, the use of zebrafish in classroom settings requires additional experimental resources and poses ethical challenges related to animal use. To mitigate these factors, we have developed an application (app), simUfish, which implements a mathematical model of zebrafish behavior for generating multiple fish trajectories and animating their body undulations. simUfish is developed using a multiplatform game engine and is expected to promote the knowledge of zebrafish behavior to both K-12 students and the general public. Specifically, it demonstrates basic principles of fish individual and social behaviors, including environment interaction; fear response toward a predator; shoaling; and attraction toward a stimulus, which can be a food source or simply a finger placed on the touch screen. The effectiveness of the app as an accessible experimental tool for learning was tested in an outreach activity on middle school students from the New York City school system. The results from this activity show an immediate, tangible improvement of students' satisfaction and willingness to learn about key concepts on zebrafish behavior, accompanied by high level of interest in life sciences.

AB  - Assessments, embedded with teachers' implicit (i.e. tacit) domain knowledge, play an important role in evaluating 'comprehension of a subject. The knowledge on the importance of both the concepts and their relationships of a subject, if captured, made explicit, and shared around, may greatly help teachers construct more effective assessments. This study establishes a methodology to accumulate tacit knowledge of specific topics from collected assessments by using an implicit knowledge extraction mechanism and, visualises the overall importance distribution of concepts by using knowledge maps for helping teachers compile their assessments. Several two stage experiments, scheduled for one semester, were conducted in the third grade natural science courses at elementary schools in Taiwan. Eighteen teachers who actually teach the courses participated in the experiments, and thirty students were in each course. In the first stage, teachers compiled assessments without using IKMAAS's knowledge map features while in the second stage, they did use them. System usage records, questionnaires and interview results were used for evaluating the usability of the methodology and the satisfaction of using IKMAAS. The results indicate the potential of the methodology, as each of the teachers agreed that the visualised assessment knowledge helped them to comprehend the proportions of concepts they intended to test easily and, additionally, helped them to clearly notice concepts they may have ignored. Yet the results in this study also show the potential of using knowledge maps and knowledge accumulating methodology in pedagogy paradigm. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The aim of this research was to explore the effect of a Technology-enhanced Metacognitive Learning Platform (TeMLP) on student's monitoring accuracy and understanding of electricity. An interactive TeMLP was prepared on the electricity unit covering the topics of static and current electricity for 7th graders; the platform contained computer animations, science experiments, e-diaries, and metacognitive prompts. In this research, pre-test/post-test control group semi-experimental model was used. The Metacognition Scale and Essay Questions on Static and Current Electricity were used as data collection tools in this research. In addition, Essay Questions on the Learning Platform and the self-explanations of students in the learning platform database were also used in the experimental group. The pre-test and post-test comparisons regarding the Metacognition Scale for the group showed that the students in the experimental group had significantly higher post-test scores compared to control group students in terms of the control and monitoring subscales. The results of the essay questions on static and current electricity revealed an important difference between the groups favoring learning platform. The views of the students about the software support these results. The conclusions drawn by the research led to recommendations for researchers about the metacognitive prompts to be employed in technology-enhanced learning platforms.

AB  - Research suggests that scaffolding is an important element when gaining problem-solving skills. However, very little research has investigated the role of fading and explored its implications in the context of deep learning. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of fading question prompts on argumentation as learners were given two fading schedules, (1) sustained scaffold schedule, and (2) faded scaffold schedule. We employed three different measurements of argumentation quality to triangulate the results. When using the rubric assessment method, we found no significant differences between the two conditions in argumentation quality. However, when using learning analytics to examine the conceptual linkages of students' knowledge structure, we found that students in the sustained scaffolding condition performed significantly better than the students in the faded condition. The results indicated that (a) scaffolds should not be faded before students have acquired the necessary problem-solving processes and (b) that novices might need a fuller set of scaffolds for a longer period to support their problem-solving performance. Implications for theory and methods are discussed. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - The popularity of the term "integrated curriculum'' has grown immensely in medical education over the last two decades, but what does this term mean and how do we go about its design, implementation, and evaluation? Definitions and application of the term vary greatly in the literature, spanning from the integration of content within a single lecture to the integration of a medical school's comprehensive curriculum. Taking into account the integrated curriculum's historic and evolving base of knowledge and theory, its support from many national medical education organizations, and the ever-increasing body of published examples, we deem it necessary to present a guide to review and promote further development of the integrated curriculum movement in medical education with an international perspective. We introduce the history and theory behind integration and provide theoretical models alongside published examples of common variations of an integrated curriculum. In addition, we identify three areas of particular need when developing an ideal integrated curriculum, leading us to propose the use of a new, clarified definition of "integrated curriculum'', and offer a review of strategies to evaluate the impact of an integrated curriculum on the learner. This Guide is presented to assist educators in the design, implementation, and evaluation of a thoroughly integrated medical school curriculum.

AB  - Chemistry has played a central role over the past century in the large-scale anthropogenic transformation of matter into diverse materials that have improved the quality of life for many people on our planet. The lens of chemistry is fundamentally necessary to understand the resulting flux of chemical substances in Earth system processes, the unintended consequences of those transformations, impacts on food supply security, water and energy concerns, ways to mediate and adapt to climate change, loss of biodiversity, and how best to build and maintain resilient ecosystems. Reactive nitrogen compounds (Nr) such as ammonia from the industrial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen exemplify both the central importance of chemistry in providing food and meeting basic human needs for a global population of 8 billion people and the sustainability challenges arising from the intended and unintended consequences of large-scale human production and release of Nr. The chemistry profession can use systems thinking (ST) tools and the Planetary Boundaries framework to understand and address challenges facing the entire Earth system resulting from the altered biogeochemical flows of nitrogen. This analysis has compelling priority due to the roles Nr currently plays in global food production and ammonia's potential role as an energy carrier for large-scale human activities in a future low carbon economy and as a domestic refrigerant while hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are being phased out. As this example illustrates, navigating the complex benefits and challenges large-scale human activity imposes on Earth system processes requires the convergence of chemistry research, industrial practice, and education. Since the chemical reactions and processes that transform matter are foundational to sustainability challenges, this perspective maps, through a chemistry for sustainability pyramid, 'multiple levels at which chemistry can contribute toward the emergence of sustainability of the Earth system'. We conclude with recommendations for steps the profession of chemistry can take to make education relevant and engaging and to connect chemistry research and practice to cross-disciplinary sustainability challenges, thereby transforming the science of transformation of matter toward sustainability.

AB  - Background It is now essential for students to learn in the science classroom about climate change and the part they can play in ameliorating its consequences. This requires science teachers to have a secure understanding of climate change. Purpose The aim of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of a two-day outdoor educational workshop on preservice teachers' awareness of climate change and the role of forests in mitigating the effects of climate change. Participants 20 pre-service teachers voluntarily participated in the workshop. Design and method A one-group pre-and post-test design was used to investigate the changes in preservice teachers' cognitive structures after attending the workshop. Data were collected using a word association test (pre and post) and participants' reflection forms (post). The cut-off technique was used in analysing the word association test and thematic analysis was used in analysing participants' reflection forms. Results The results indicated that the workshop stimulated preservice teachers' cognitive structures and conceptual understandings of climate change. Moreover, they generally had positive opinions about the workshop activities, emphasizing that these increased their awareness and empathy skills. However, they also indicated a small range of negative factors including a lack of time, materials, and opportunity to debate, and being tired. Conclusions Non-formal outdoor learning programmes can promote learning and increase preservice teachers' awareness with respect to climate change.

AB  - Purpose Students' simplistic observations and uninspired solutions for social-ecological dilemmas were the motivation for this study. The purpose of this paper is to foster systemic thinking in students and study the role of the lecturers. Design/methodology/approach The research was designed as a self-study action-research (AR), which was carried out by the lecturers of an environmental citizenship course in a teachers' college. The paper describes three AR circuits, expressed in three stages of field mapping by students: group mapping at the beginning of the course, initial individual field mapping and field mapping prior to action design. Findings Analyzing the maps after each stage allowed for design modifications. The findings indicate that field mapping helped students better understand the complexity of a social-ecological system and their role within it. Lecturers were required to maintain a delicate balance between teaching and supporting the students' first-hand experience as environmental citizens. Research limitations/implications - The study's conclusions are based on a case study and are therefore presented dialectically rather than as global generalizations. Practical implications - Mapping the field of action can serve as a powerful tool in fostering a system approach to environmental citizenship in many educational settings. Originality/value The paper presents the use of Kurt Lewin's field theory for environmental education and for fostering environmental citizenship based on systemic and ecological thinking. The diversity of students' conceptualizations of the complexity of a social-ecological system, as revealed in this study, calls for further research of field-mapping as a teaching method.

AB  - Conceptual mapping tools have been used more and more for various educational purposes in recent years by academicians and educators. In addition, developments of technology that include conceptual mapping have a significant influence on education sustainability. Nevertheless, students' understanding and motivation in using conceptual mapping in the context of education sustainability has rarely been assessed. Thus, this study could be useful for developing and testing theories related to using conceptual mapping, as well as for practitioners who use conceptual mapping in education sustainability. Besides being used as a method of assessment, these mapping tools are used to improve the students' critical and analytical thinking skills and to facilitate the demonstration of relationships among concepts. Instead of using written or verbal descriptions, these tools utilise various diagrammatic relationships. The use of pictures, diagrams and visual illustrations are believed to facilitate the understanding of complex topics more readily. Therefore, this research aims to develop a new model that employs conceptual mapping for improving the motivation and achievements of students. A survey was distributed to 247 participants who are using conceptual mapping tools for learning, and the data were quantitatively analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM-Amos). The results of this study show that conceptual mapping can be used to increase students' understanding and motivation to improve their academic achievements.

AB  - Educating the next generation of physicians is a key means of communicating and disseminating impactful immunologic scientific knowledge, and its practical application to human disease. We present our perspective, using as our model a first-year medical school course entitled Host Defense. As the name suggests, immunology is the overarching principle that links the multiple subjects in the course. We address a range of immunologically relevant topics, including innate and adaptive immunity, vaccines, inflammation, allergy, tumor immunotherapy, transplantation, and autoimmunity. These topics are integrated with the fields of infectious diseases, pathology, clinical laboratory testing, and public health, to illustrate how the basic science discoveries in immunology are relevant to clinical practice. The course objectives are not only to deliver "first principles" and molecular mechanisms, but also to connect these principles with the clinical world of diagnosis and therapy. We detail the different methodologies used to achieve these objectives and to reach today's medical students. This provides a framework for course structure and execution designed to engage both the novice and the more "immunologically experienced" learner. The framework includes classical didactic components and personalized instructor access, aligned with current approaches to self-directed learning and using digital media. We also address some of the challenges of assembling a course like Host Defense in the context of an academic medical center with multiple scientific, educational, and clinical missions. This perspective is not meant be proscriptive, but rather to outline our experiences on the strategies tried, while describing their advantages and drawbacks in teaching immunology.

AB  - This study developed and implemented a learner-centered assessment named Creative Exercises (CEs) in introductory chemistry courses at a four-year university and a two-year community college. CEs were developed and implemented as an intervention for treatment groups. The control groups only used traditional assessments such as multiple-choice and short-answer questions. A mixed-methods approach was employed for evaluating the effectiveness of CEs in improving student learning and performance. First, quantitative data included student exam scores, DFW rates, and percentages of letter grades were analyzed and compared between treatment and control groups. Second, student responses to CEs were coded as chemistry concepts and then organized into chemistry topics. A series of visual maps were plotted to show students' linking of chemistry topics and progress made throughout the semester. Lastly, student perceptions of the use of CEs were investigated via a free-response survey. Quantitative results showed that CEs improved students' academic performance and retention in introductory chemistry courses at both college settings. The implementation at the two settings indicated that the frequency and quality of the use of CEs might impact the effectiveness. The results from qualitative data analyses converged with the positive effects of CEs. Students were able to connect prior and newly-learned topics in response to CEs and made progress on linking more topics over time. Open coding of the free-response survey data identified four themes explaining why the use of CEs helped students: knowledge integration, conceptual understanding, flexibility, and more effective study habits. Best practices for implementation of learner-centered assessments learned in this study and future directions for research are discussed.

AB  - Recent studies have found that comments from teaching assistants may encourage interactions in edX-like Massive Open Online Course (xMOOC) forums. However, how concepts from these interactions are conveyed to other xMOOC participants has not received much attention. Therefore, this study focuses on a unidirectional teaching assistant-student xMOOC interaction (TS interaction), a content-related pair including one question from a student and one immediate answer from a teaching assistant. The authors particularly investigate the linguistic features (i.e., concept connectivity, concept concreteness, readability and semantic overlap) of concept conveying in TS interactions with many responses (mTS) and with few responses (fTS). In addition, a language factor (English and Chinese) is also considered. Additionally, the interaction transcripts from science lectures (SL) and political briefings (PB) were used as control groups as two opposite cases of concept conveying. At the concept level, the concept conveying in transcripts were modelled as a graph, and measured by common indicators in graph theory. At the overall level, the concept conveying in transcripts were measured by regular linguistic measuring tools. The results show that interactions with mTS and fTS demonstrate different concept conveying tendencies toward SL and PB in terms of linguistic features in both languages. The results suggest that in both languages, teaching assistants may use mixed concept-conveying strategies to stimulate more follow-up responses in xMOOC forums. These conclusions drawn from TS interactions can be even partially generalized in a larger student-student (SS) interaction dataset.

AB  - Technology is ubiquitous in the modern world; to harness its educational potential in the quest to introduce environments that are flexible and differentiate for individual student learning needs, the strategic use of the complex array of tools is required. Engagement with this challenge has the potential to lead to the provision of interfaces that allow students to access these resources and become independent learners. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate the features of such interfaces to calibrate and respond to individual student needs. In this context, the quality of differentiated support for learning, referred to as scaffolding, is established as paramount to the design and structure of online environments. In this study, the instructional design referred to as predict, observe, explain and evaluate (POEE), informed by constructivist theories of learning, to implement multiple scaffolding strategies is described. The POEE scaffolding strategy was applied in the creation of two inquiry learning modules. Student engagement with these inquiry modules in a self-directed online environment was explored to identify critical elements of the scaffolding. The findings of this study, based on students' interactions and engagement with the learning modules, enabled the conceptualisation of a multimodal scaffolding strategy for self-directed inquiry. We propose that the recommendations from the implementation of these scaffolded learning modules can represent exemplars illustrative of an enriched instructional design paradigm to support students' independent study in blended environments.

AB  - Laboratory report writing should promote learners' ability to reason scientifically from data to conclusions, especially if opportunities for collaborative discussion are provided, yet few studies have examined the use of writing as a tool for the development of scientific reasoning skills.  The purpose of this study was to investigate scientific reasoning skills used by students in a naturalistic collaborative writing context and changes in students' reasoning discourse over time.  During the fall and winter of 1992-1993, three ninth grade general science classes taught by one teacher participated in a collaborative writing intervention.  The students wrote ten collaborative laboratory reports over the course of the intervention.  Report guidelines were designed by the teacher and the researcher to assist students with their writing.  An interpretive research design was used to study the conversations of three target student pairs in depth.  Eleven distinct, yet integrated scientific reasoning skills used to support report composition emerged from the data.  The emergent scientific reasoning skills reflected the socially constructed nature of reasoning for collaborative writing.  Patterns in the data revealed that all target students used reasoning skills in similar ways to:  (a) assess prior models of scientific phenomena; (b) generate new models for scientific phenomena; (c) extend models to new situations; and (d) support other forms of reasoning.  One of the target pairs improved their reasoning discourse over time by discussing conceptual meanings more fully and bringing specific information into their conversations.  The other two target pairs did not change their reasoning discourse systematically throughout the intervention.  The findings of this study suggest that an understanding of socially constructed scientific reasoning skills is important for designing meaningful collaborative activities and assessments in science.

AB  - This study evaluates the use of an open-ended question to determine students' knowledge structure on the topic of galvanic cells. The open-ended question was developed and administered to 163 Grade 10 students who had earlier completed a course on electrochemistry. Students' responses were marked as well as coded on the basis of the fields identified from their responses. This was then evaluated statistically to determine the collective knowledge structure of the sample of students. The knowledge structure thus mapped contains both canonical concepts and alternative conceptions (ACs). An important finding emerging from this study is that instructors need to focus student's attention on the dynamic processes involving electrons and ions during the operation of galvanic cells. In order for students to fully understand how a galvanic cell operates, they need to see the whole picture. There are three critical components that lead to students' understanding of how an oxidation-reduction reaction can generate energy and how a circuit is complete: transfer of electrons during oxidation-reduction half-reactions, flow of electrons within metals, and migration of ions in solution. Also, we found that it is possible for students to use correct chemistry concepts in an incorrect way by establishing linkages among these in an inappropriate manner. We reiterate that apart from evaluating students' ACs, it is also important to evaluate the links between the concepts and conceptions present in students' knowledge structure so that teaching can be made more effective.

AB  - This quasi-experimental investigation describes the influence of text signals on second language expository science text comprehension. In two course sections, mixed proficiency Korean English language learners (n = 88) read one of two print-based English expository text passage versions. Participants in one section (n = 44) were given a version with interesting but non-important subtopics (NIS) underlined, while participants in the other section (n = 44) were given an alternate version with the same number of substantively important subtopics (SIS) underlined. Participants read the text passage and created a visual map of the text, and then completed a comprehension posttest that measured global inferences (all in English). Analysis of variance of the comprehension posttest data revealed significant differences for the two main factors, proficiency level (Low or High) and text signal condition (NIS or SIS), and for the interaction of proficiency and text signal condition; with Cohen effect sizes, d = Low-NIS (.16) < High-NIS (.56) < Low-SIS (.74) < High-SIS (1.37). Descriptively, both headings and important subtopic terms predominated in the SIS maps, but only non-important subtopic terms and not headings predominated in the NIS maps. Further, the visual map forms, as measured by vector pattern matching and by graph centrality, were also substantially different. Compared to the NIS maps, on average the SIS map forms were more relational and more like the expert's map, while the NIS map forms were more linear, and showed a primacy effect. These results suggest that coherent text signals in these print-based readings strongly influenced bilinguals' science expository text comprehension.

AB  - Automated writing evaluation (AWE) plays an important role in writing pedagogy and has received considerable research attention recently; however, few reviews have been conducted to systematically analyze the recent publications arising from the many studies in this area. The present review aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the literature on AWE feedback for writing in terms of methodology, types of learners, types of feedback and its applications, learning outcomes, and implications. A total of 48 articles from Social Science Citation Index journals and four other important journals in the field of language education were collected and analyzed. The findings revealed that most previous studies on AWE applied quantitative research methods, rather than purely qualitative ones. The duration of the experiments in approximately 33% of the studies was shorter than ten weeks, and 10% of the studies were of one session only. The group size of over half of the studies had fewer than 30 participants, and 21% of the studies had medium to large group sizes (from 51 to 100). The focus of most of the articles was on L2 writers with little attention paid to L1 writers and K12 students. AWE feedback to some extent can improve students' writing from the product-oriented aspect but is not as effective as human feedback (e.g. teacher or peer feedback). Students generally considered AWE feedback useful and were motivated when using it, although they noticed a lack of accuracy and explicitness as the feedback tended to be generic and formulaic. The results of the review have several implications for researchers, teachers, and developers of AWE systems.

AB  - An active learning activity was used to engage students and enhance in-class learning of cell cycle regulation in a PharmD level integrated biological sciences course. The aim of the present study was to determine the effectiveness and perception of the in-class activity. After completion of a lecture on the topic of cell cycle regulation, students completed a 10-question multiple-choice quiz before and after engaging in the activity. The activity involved reading of a headline news article published by ScienceDaily.com entitled "One Gene Lost Equals One limb Regained." The name of the gene was deleted from the article and, thus, the end goal of the activity was to determine the gene of interest by the description in the story. The activity included compiling a list of all potential gene candidates before sufficient information was given to identify the gene of interest (p21). A survey was completed to determine student perceptions of the activity. Quiz scores improved by an average of 20% after the activity (40.1 +/- 1.95 vs. 59.9 +/- 2.14, P < 0.0001, n = 96). Students enjoyed the activity, found the news article interesting, and believed that the activity improved their understanding of cell cycle regulation. The majority of students agreed that the in-class activity piqued their interest for learning the subject matter and also agreed that if they understand a concept during class, they are more likely to want to study that concept outside of class. In conclusion, the activity improved in-class understanding and enhanced interest in cell cycle regulation.

AB  - Climate change education, because it involves a socio-scientific issue (SSI), holds unique challenges in both formal and informal educational settings. Climate change is a multi-science at the crossroads of numerous basic sciences such as chemistry and physics, thus requiring special skills of its educators and communicators. Furthermore, climate change, like all SSIs, is treated as more than a science issue, precipitating vastly different social framings that are sometimes expressly designed to cast doubt on consensus findings from the climate change scientific community.
   The mixing of social ways of knowing with scientific bases complicates not only the jobs of educators of SSIs such as climate change, evolution, and immunology; it also confuses young learners about which sources to believe and which ones to reject. As such, students' misconceptions about SSIs are more common than their misconceptions about non-controversial science topics such as cell biology. For some students, social ways of knowing compete for dominance with scientific ways of knowing about SSIs, thus necessitating conceptual change education.
   In 1982, Cacioppo & Petty introduced the Need for Cognition Scale (NfC), the first quantitative measure of "the tendency for an individual to engage in and enjoy thinking." Since its introduction, NfC has been used in hundreds of studies. NfC has also been shown to significantly and positively correlate with many valued learning practices including strategic reading, critical thinking, abstraction, reflection, and open-mindedness. Given that these practices are also highly useful in SSI education, it is not surprising that students who measure highly in NfC also have been shown to have scientific knowledge that is more representative of scientific consensus.
   Therefore, this research primarily focuses on assessing the correlation between Need for Cognition and climate change topical knowledge among children between the ages 7 and 13. Unique in this research, NfC has rarely been used to assess subjects younger than college age. Furthermore, this research utilizes an NfC question set that has been customized for younger participants' reading skills and life experiences. The foundational hypothesis of this work is that, as early as middle school and even late primary school ages, a positive and significant correlation exists between NfC and children's scientifically-based conceptions about climate change. The results of this study are intended to facilitate curricular and pedagogical approaches that will manifest in better comportment between students' and experts' knowledge, and less time expended on conceptual change.

AB  - We present a scoping review of methods used to elicit individuals' mental models of science or risk. Developing a shared understanding of the science related to risk is crucial for diverse individuals to collaboratively manage disaster consequences. Mental models, or people's psychological representation of how the 'world works', present a valuable tool to achieve this. Potential applications range from developing effective risk communication for use in short-warning situations to community co-development of future communication protocols for the co-management of risk. A diverse range of tools, in diverse fields, have thus been developed to elicit these mental models. Forty-four articles were selected via inclusion criteria from 561 found through a systematic search. We identified a wide range of direct and indirect elicitation techniques (concept, cognitive, flow, information world, knowledge, mind, and fuzzy cognitive maps, and decision influence diagrams) and interview-based techniques. Many used multiple elicitation techniques such as free-drawing, interviews, free-listing, sorting tasks, attitudinal surveys, photograph elicitation, metaphor analysis, and mapping software. We identify several challenges when designing elicitation methods, including researcher influence, the importance of external visualization, a lack of evaluation, the role of 'experts', and ethical considerations due to the influence of the process itself. We present a preliminary typology for elicitation and analysis and suggest future research should explore methods to assess the evolution of mental models to understand how conceptualisations change through time, experience, or public education programs. These lessons have the potential to benefit both science and disaster risk communication activities, given best practice calls for mutually constructed understanding.

AB  - The motivating concern behind CRESST's knowledge mapping research has been the desire to assess students' understanding of relationships utilizing a format that departs from both standardized multiple-choice testing and discourse-dependent tasks (e.g. essays). Fusing computer technology and knowledge mapping environments creates new instructional and assessment opportunities, primarily by providing the capability for real-time scoring, feedback, reporting, networking, and Internet/Web access. Overall, 149 middle and high school students participated in two computer-based knowledge mapping studies: (1) students constructed group maps while collaborating over a network, and (2) students constructed individual maps, attempting to improve their maps while searching a Web space. Results showed that knowledge map scores increased significantly from fall to spring for students constructing maps individually while searching a web space containing relevant and irrelevant information about environmental science. This finding supports the position that students' abilities in searching and processing information on the Internet may have increased as a result of using computer technology over the course of the school year. On the other hand, virtually no differences were found for group knowledge maps from fall to spring, and therefore no clear relationships among content understanding and collaboration were found. Four teachers' knowledge maps served as 'expert criteria' to evaluate individual student's and group's knowledge maps. The most important reliability issue for both studies focused on inter-expert agreement using teachers' maps to score students' maps. In the studies presented here, inter-expert pairwise agreements for both studies were in the 80-90 percentage range. (C) 1999 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - If our chosen aim in science education is to be inclusive and to improve students' learning achievements, then we must identify teaching methodologies that are appropriate for teaching and learning specific knowledge. Karagiorgi and Symeo (2005) remind us that instructional designers are thus challenged to translate the philosophy of constructivism into current practice. Thus, research in science education must focus on evaluating intervention programs which ensure the effective construction of knowledge and development of competencies. The present study reports the elaboration, application and evaluation of a problem-based learning (PBL) program with the aim of examining its effectiveness with students learning Environmental Education. Prior research on both PBL and Environmental Education (EE) was conducted within the context of science education so as to elaborate and construct the intervention program. Findings from these studies indicated both the PBL methodology and EE as helpful for teachers and students. PBL methodology has been adopted in this study since it is logically incorporated in a constructivism philosophy application (Hendry et al. 1999) and it was expected that this approach would assist students towards achieving a specific set of competencies (Engel 1997). On the other hand, EE has evolved at a rapid pace within many countries in the new millennium (Hart 2007), unlike any other educational area. However, many authors still appear to believe that schools are failing to prepare students adequately in EE (Walsche 2008; Winter 2007). The following section describes the research that was conducted in both areas so as to devise the intervention program.

AB  - Many teaching approaches have been tried to improve student attitudes and achievement in science and mathematics education. Achievement effects have been synthesized, but a systematic overview of attitude effects is missing. This study provides a meta analytic review based on 56 publications (1988-2014), reporting 65 independent experiments that investigated the effects of teaching approaches on student attitudes in primary or secondary science or mathematics education. Five types of teaching approaches were distinguished: inquiry-based, context-based, computer-based, collaborative learning strategies, and extra-curricular activities. Since many different attitude outcomes were distinguished and attitudes were assessed at different levels of granularity, we did separate analyses for specific and more global outcomes. Outcomes were not significantly different for different educational approaches. When taking all interventions together, significant effects were found for General Attitude (n = 60; d = 0.35), General Interest (n = 20; d = 0.22), and Career Interest in Science (n = 4; d = 0.40). The effects were significantly weaker for studies with older students. Analysis of achievement outcomes yielded a significant and large overall effect (n = 40; d = 0.78), again with no significant differences between teaching approaches. Although the positive effects might be partly due to novelty, the current findings do counter skepticism about the learning outcomes of interest oriented teaching approaches. (C) 2016 The Authors.

AB  - This review examined articles on mobile apps for science learning published from 2007 to 2014. A qualitative content analysis was used to investigate the science mobile app research for its mobile app design, underlying theoretical foundations, and students' measured outcomes. This review found that mobile apps for science learning offered a number of similar design features, including technology-based scaffolding, location-aware functionality, visual/audio representations, digital knowledge-construction tools, digital knowledge-sharing mechanisms, and differentiated roles. Many of the studies cited a specific theoretical foundation, predominantly situated learning theory, and applied this to the design of the mobile learning environment. The most common measured outcome was students' basic scientific knowledge or conceptual understanding. A number of recommendations came out of this review. Future studies need to make use of newer, available technologies; isolate the testing of specific app features; and develop additional strategies around using mobile apps for collaboration. Researchers need to make more explicit connections between the instructional principles and the design features of their mobile learning environment in order to better integrate theory with practice. In addition, this review noted that stronger alignment is needed between the underlying theories and measured outcomes, and more studies are needed to assess students' higher-level cognitive outcomes, cognitive load, and skill-based outcomes such as problem solving. Finally, more research is needed on how science mobile apps can be used with more varied science topics and diverse audiences. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB  - Background and purpose: Research in formative assessment often pays close attention to the strategies which can be used by teachers. However, less emphasis in the literature seems to have been paid to study the application of formative assessment designs in practice. In this paper, we argue that a formative assessment design that we call Eva-Mapping, which is developed on the principles of design-based research, can be a productive starting point for disseminating and further developing formative assessment practices in outdoor science teaching.Sample, design and methods: We conducted an evaluation of the design, based on video-elicited focus group interviews with two groups of experienced science teachers. Both groups consisted of teachers who taught science outside the classroom on a regular basis. These groups watched identical video sequences which were recorded during lessons in which teachers applied the formative assessment design. These sequences focused on formative assessment in pairs, in small groups, or in whole class sessions. Afterwards, the teachers discussed each sequence. These discussions were audio recorded and later transcribed. The transcriptions were analysed using content analysis.Findings: By analysing the interview data, we identified two categories of context-determining factors that influenced the formative assessment design (namely, Resources or Lack of Resources and The Outdoors) and three mechanisms that influenced the assessment process (namely, Teacher Involvement, Structure in Peer Assessment and Knowledge Sharing). Finally, we identified four perceived outcomes of the formative assessment design: Enthusiasm, Knowledge Application, Acquirements and Insight into the Learning Processes.Conclusion: We suggest that knowledge within the identified categories can provide useful guidelines for the future development of formative assessment in science teaching that integrates the outdoors. This is because such knowledge forms part of teachers' perceptions regarding the acceptability and utility of the formative assessment design. In addition, our study contributes to evidence within an underexplored aspect of formal outdoor science education.

AB  - The mission of professional training is to foster learners' abilities to perform analysis and to carry out problem-solving. During the process of professional training, how to promote learners' selfefficacy, re-organization, and reflection is the key to boosting their problem-solving abilities. However, conventional professional training programs tend to rely on teachers' elaboration of basic knowledge and cases. They also use graphical organizers for knowledge organization. The main focus of this learning method aims at promoting learners' memory and assisting their comprehension of the overall structure of the knowledge. However, learners who use this method often fail to develop a deep understanding of the relationship of different cases without additional supports. To solve this problem, this study proposed a technology-enhanced Annotation, Questioning, Summarization, and Reflection (AQSR) training approach which uses a graphic organizer to guide trainees to gain knowledge during the process of comprehending and organizing learning content. To evaluate the effectiveness of these strategies, a quasi-experiment was conducted to compare the performances of the AQSR-based graphic organizer approach and the conventional graphic organizer-based training. The participants were new nursing staff who were enrolled in two classes of a training program. From the experimental results, it was found that the nursing staff who used the AQSR training approach showed significantly better learning achievements and case analysis test scores as well as more positive learning attitudes than those who used the conventional graphic organizer-based training, showing the potential of the proposed approach for professional training.

AB  - Clinical reasoning is the thought process that guides practice. Although a plethora of clinical reasoning studies in healthcare professionals exists, the majority appear to originate from Western cultures. A scoping review was undertaken to examine clinical reasoning related research across Asian cultures. PubMed, SciVerse Scopus, Web of Science and Airiti Library databases were searched. Inclusion criteria included full-text articles published in Asian countries (2007 to 2019). Search terms included clinical reasoning, thinking process, differential diagnosis, decision making, problem-based learning, critical thinking, healthcare profession, institution, medical students and nursing students. After applying exclusion criteria, n = 240 were included in the review. The number of publications increased in 2012 (from 5%, n = 13 in 2011 to 9%, n = 22) with a steady increase onwards to 12% (n = 29) in 2016. South Korea published the most articles (19%, n = 46) followed by Iran (17%, n = 41). Nurse Education Today published 11% of the articles (n = 26), followed by BMC Medical Education (5%, n = 13). Nursing and Medical students account for the largest population groups studied. Analysis of the articles resulted in seven themes: Evaluation of existing courses (30%, n = 73) being the most frequently identified theme. Only seven comparative articles showed cultural implications, but none provided direct evidence of the impact of culture on clinical reasoning. We illuminate the potential necessity of further research in clinical reasoning, specifically with a focus on how clinical reasoning is affected by national culture. A better understanding of current clinical reasoning research in Asian cultures may assist curricula developers in establishing a culturally appropriate learning environment.

AB  - Research on nature of science (NOS) and scientific inquiry (SI) has indicated that a teacher's knowledge of each, however well developed, is not sufficient to ensure that these conceptions necessarily manifest themselves in classroom practice (Lederman & Druger, 1985; Lederman, 2007). In light of considerable research that has examined teachers' subject matter knowledge structures and their classroom practices (e.g., Gess-Newsome & Lederman, 1993, 1995), what was conspicuously absent was an assessment of teachers' knowledge structures for NOS and SI. The current investigation inferred the classroom practice knowledge structures for NOS and SI for four physics teachers. These results were then compared to responses communicated through the Knowledge Structures for NOS and SI (KS4NS) questionnaire and subsequent interview. The degree of congruence between the two knowledge structures was gauged at the level of included concepts, connections between concepts, and for other organizational or thematic elements. The results indicated limited congruence between teachers' knowledge structures for NOS and SI and those espoused in their classroom practice. Most notable was the dearth of connections evidenced between constituent aspects in the latter. The necessity of having teacher candidates explicitly reflect on the structure of the subject matter they are learning for teaching is reiterated through the findings of the current study. The utility of the KS4NS as tool to foster such reflections specifically regarding conceptualization of NOS and SI independent of, or in conjunction with, traditional subject matter also warrants further investigation, particularly in light of the recently released Next Generation Science Standards and their highly integrative conception of science.

AB  - The Ocean Observatories Initiative (OOI) promises to reshape the way ocean science is conducted by providing ocean researchers with access to near real-time data, the ability to control/configure sensors and mobile assets, high-bandwidth infrastructure for images, powerful cyberinfrastructure, and data visualization and modeling tools to conduct their research. Recent advances in the delivery of web-based education, and the use of visualization technology in educational contexts, have led to the development of on-line platforms for instruction that engage students in active scientific inquiry by collecting and analyzing real world data. The OOI Education and Public Engagement (EPE) Implementing Organization will leverage these technologies for ocean education. EPE will construct a series of software tools and a web-based social network that leverages the OOI Cyberinfrastructure to support engagement of a wide range of users. These tools will enable educators and developers to enhance their undergraduate education programs and engage free choice learners using real-time and streaming data provided by the OOI. EPE will enable a new approach to oceanography research, where scientists, students and the public can explore and research the ocean in real-time from their classrooms, offices, dorm rooms, and even their homes. The face of an oceanographer will be expanded well beyond the professor at sea to to a student at home viewing and analyzing exactly the same data at exactly the same time.
   In addition to the OOI EPE Implementing Organization (IO), there are additional IOs supporting the OOI construction (Figure 1):
   Regional Scale Nodes (RSN): RSN will deploy sensors to study Hydrate Ridge, an area of massive sub-seafloor gashydrate deposits, and Axial Seamount, an active submarine volcano.
   Coastal and Global Scale Nodes (CGSN): CGSN will deploy a global array of moorings and underwater gliders to provide sustained, but adaptable, access to complex coastal and global systems.
   Cyberinfrastructure (CI): The CI will provide a common operating infrastructure connecting and coordinating the operations of the marine components with the OOI scientific and educational pursuits.
   Program Management Office (PMO): The OOI program is funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) and managed by the OOI PMO, located at the Consortium for Ocean Leadership (COL) offices in Washington, D.C.

TI  - THE SITUATIONS OF INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS DEVELOPMENT OF IMAM HATIP SCHOOLS VOCATIONAL TEACHERS
T2  - BILIMNAME
KW  - Religious education
KW  - Imam Hatip Schools teachers
KW  - Instructional Technology
KW  - Material development
AB  - This study was aimed at determining the situation of material development of Imam Hatip School vocational courses teachers. The research is a survey model. According to this research results was made in Kayseri sample, Majority of the participant teachers suffer from inappropriate materials to the students and topics at their lessons. Most of teachers come to schools with making preparation. Participant teachers continue using current teaching materials and also try to prepare their own materials.
   Introduction and Purpose of the Study The Religious educational process has four basic variables. These are students, teachers, programs and the environment. The most important of these variables are the teachers. The teachers must/should plan, apply and evaluate the educational process. They should use teaching methods and tools in this process. With the development of technological possibilities, the number of teaching materials that can be used in religious education has increased. Educational materials can make lessons more fun and educational, and it can offer to students a rich learning experience. For this reason, effective use of materials by the religious teachers can contribute to the reduction of problems such as indifference, reluctance and boredom in religious education.
   The main purpose of this research was to determine the situation of material development by the Imam Hatip School vocational courses teachers. In this context, some questions asked are;
   1. Are they having trouble finding instructional materials? What are these troubles?
   2. How much did they develop educational materials in the process of Religious education?
   3. How did they get them?
   4. What kind of materials did they develop most?
   5. What are they paying attention to when developing them?
   6. What kind of problems they have experienced in this process? And similar questions are asked and answered
   Method
   The research is a survey model that describes the current situation. In the study datas were gathered by questionnaire on 82 Imam Hatip School vocational courses teachers in Kayseri province. 21 IBM SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software program was used to test hypotheses generated for the purposes of research. Quantitative analyses methods (means, percentages), were used in analyzing the data. 56 % of the participants are men and 44 % are women. % 45 of them working at imam hatip high school, % 39 are imam hatip midle school, % 16 are both of them.
   Results and Discussion
   According to this research results, the participant teachers say they are having trouble finding instructional materials. Some of the teachers have said that they have not prepared their materials because of the inadequacy of the class hours. Nevertheless, they do not see themselves inadequate in material development, and the proportion of teachers who prepare their own materials has been expected to be low. They generally prefer to use ready-made materials. They provide materials from their colleagues and internet sites. The worksheet, the concept map, the slide are the materials that they get the most from the internet. The materials they do not prepare are short films, puzzles and slides. The proportion of teachers who prepare material for their students is also very low. Most of the materials that prepared by their students 13 % model-real goods and 11% worksheets).
   When the teachers preparing materials for religious instruction, they were paying attention to the content compliance most. To be suitable for students' features and grade follow them. A little number of teachers say that they are developing materials according to the teaching aims and functions. It is concluded that imam hatip secondary school teachers are more sensitive about developing materials than Imam Hatip High School Teachers. Additionally, female teachers are developing these materials more often than the male teachers.
   At the end of this survey, it was discovered, despite the fact that the teachers were having trouble finding instructional materials they did not develop their Instructional materials. Because, a large group of teachers, 82.5%, saw themselves as lacking in teaching technology and material development. Also, according to this data and researches done in the past years. Religious Education Teachers are developing their materials have increased but some teachers (who are working at Imam hatip high schools) don't know functions of materials and they don't develop them in their lessons.
   Suggestions
   The issue can be focused especially on teachers Imam Hatip High School lessons. These suggestions can be expressed in the light of these results. The Ministry of National Education, The General Directorate of Religious Education can work on this subject. Information and materials banks can be created in virtual environment where the institutions for the imam hatip school's courses, also material samples. It is possible to increase the number of sharing sites where materials related to the field of Religious Education, especially Imam Hatip High School lessons are collected. And they can be give information about Instructional Technology and Material Development course for Imam Hatip Schools teachers. Further research can be done in this subject.

AB  - ContextTransfer' is the application of a previously learned concept to solve a new problem in another context. Transfer is essential for basic science education because, to be valuable, basic science knowledge must be transferred to clinical problem solving. Therefore, better understanding of interventions that enhance the transfer of basic science knowledge to clinical reasoning is essential. This review systematically identifies interventions described in the health professions education (HPE) literature that document the transfer of basic science knowledge to clinical reasoning, and considers teaching and assessment strategies.
   MethodsA systematic search of the literature was conducted. Articles related to basic science teaching at the undergraduate level in HPE were analysed using a transfer out'/'transfer in' conceptual framework. Transfer out' refers to the application of knowledge developed in one learning situation to the solving of a new problem. Transfer in' refers to the use of previously acquired knowledge to learn from new problems or learning situations.
   ResultsOf 9803 articles initially identified, 627 studies were retrieved for full text evaluation; 15 were included in the literature review. A total of 93% explored transfer out' to clinical reasoning and 7% (one article) explored transfer in'. Measures of transfer out' fostered by basic science knowledge included diagnostic accuracy over time and in new clinical cases. Basic science knowledge supported learning - transfer in' - of new related content and ultimately the transfer out' to diagnostic reasoning. Successful teaching strategies included the making of connections between basic and clinical sciences, the use of commonsense analogies, and the study of multiple clinical problems in multiple contexts. Performance on recall tests did not reflect the transfer of basic science knowledge to clinical reasoning.
   ConclusionsTransfer of basic science knowledge to clinical reasoning is an essential component of HPE that requires further development for implementation and scholarship.
   This literature review reveals the positive effect of basic science learning on transfer of knowledge and clinical reasoning.

AB  - Although dental education has traditionally been organized into basic sciences education (first and second years) and clinical education (third and fourth years), there has been growing interest in ways to better integrate the two to more effectively educate students and prepare them for practice. Since 2012, The University of Texas School of Dentistry at Houston (UTSD) has made it a priority to improve integration of basic and clinical sciences, with a focus to this point on integrating the basic sciences. The aim of this study was to determine the perspectives of basic and clinical science faculty members regarding basic and clinical sciences integration and the degree of integration currently occurring. In October 2016, all 227 faculty members (15 basic scientists and 212 clinicians) were invited to participate in an online survey. Of the 212 clinicians, 84 completed the clinician educator survey (response rate 40%). All 15 basic scientists completed the basic science educator survey (response rate 100%). The majority of basic and clinical respondents affirmed the value of integration (93.3%, 97.6%, respectively) and reported regular integration in their teaching (80%, 86.9%). There were no significant differences between basic scientists and clinicians on perceived importance (p=0.457) and comfort with integration (p=0.240), but the basic scientists were more likely to integrate (p=0.039) and collaborate (p=0.021) than the clinicians. There were no significant differences between generalist and specialist clinicians on importance (p=0.474) and degree (p=0.972) of integration in teaching and intent to collaborate (p=0.864), but the specialists reported feeling more comfortable presenting basic science information (p=0.033). Protected faculty time for collaborative efforts and a repository of integrated basic science and clinical examples for use in teaching and faculty development were recommended to improve integration. Although questions might be raised about the respondents' definition of "integration," this study provides a baseline assessment of perceptions at a dental school that is placing a priority on integration.

AB  - What factor(s) influence the likelihood a student will succeed in college biology? Some researchers have found the primary determinant to be the student's prior knowledge of biology, while others have found it to be reasoning ability. Perhaps the ability of these factors to predict achievement depends on the instructional method employed. Expository instruction focuses primarily on facts and concepts. Therefore, perhaps the best predictor of achievement in expository classes is domain-specific prior knowledge. inquiry instruction focuses more on how science is done, i.e., on scientific processes; therefore, perhaps the best predictor in inquiry classes is reasoning ability. This study was designed to test these hypotheses. Students enrolled in a nonmajors community college biology course were pretested to determine reasoning ability and prior knowledge. The number of previous biology courses was also recorded as an indicator of prior knowledge. After a semester of either expository or inquiry (learning-cycle) instruction, students took a comprehensive final examination. Reasoning ability but not prior knowledge or number of previous biology courses accounted for a significant amount of variance in final examination score in both instructional methods and with semester examination and quiz scores in inquiry classes. This suggests that reasoning ability limits achievement more than prior knowledge among these biology students, whether they are enrolled in expository or inquiry classes. Reasoning ability explained more of the variance in final examination scores for students enrolled in expository classes (18.8%) than in inquiry classes (7.2%). The reason for this is not clear, but significant improvements in reasoning were found in the inquiry but not in the expository classes. These improvements were accompanied by significant differences in achievement in the inquiry classes. Perhaps the reasoning improvement facilitated the better and more equal achievement for students in the inquiry classes, thus reducing the correlation between initial reasoning ability and final achievement.

AB  - The importance of language to constituting meaning in science learning has been recognized. However, how language processes in learning are affected by the limited English proficiency of language minority students has not been addressed. The purpose of this study was twofold. The first goal was to describe how Mexican American language minority students construct biology concept meanings based on extant linguistic skills. Second, Vygotsky's semiotic approach to learning was used to design instructional activity to engage students in constructing meanings through mediational means such as science language, signs and symbols, and technology. Participants were 14 sophomores from an urban immigrant community who were enrolled in a Saturday enrichment program at a private university that maintained a "partnership" with the public high school. This interpretive study is based on extensive observational data, individual and group interviews, and students' written products. Findings indicated that students were overly reliant on the teacher's oral text as a source of science meaning and deferred to him for scientific interpretations of real life experience. Designed instructional activities showed students how to use semiotic tools to construct and express conceptual meanings. Diagrams were particularly important to instructional activity because these were modified to create visual parsimonious texts that were used as templates to support student appropriation of science language. An instructional sequence that moved students through three phases of learning was identified. Receptive understanding and expression used diagrams to identify content and enable students to "ventriloquate" teacher talk. Conceptual understanding and expression engaged students in constructing conceptual expressions and advanced students from "ventriloquating" teacher talk to expressing concepts for their own purpose. Interpretative understanding and expression was achieved by students using their conceptual understanding to analyze real life experience and their expanded discursive resources to write an interpretation. As students became proficient with semiotic tools, the teacher withdrew as science authority, and students assumed responsibility for constructing meaning using their own discursive resources. The findings demonstrate the importance of confronting the mystique of science through instructional activity that provides students the opportunity to acquire the cultural authority of language and other semiotic tools.

AB  - Situating learners in a context relevant to scientific phenomena enables them to acquire knowl-edge through experience, reflection, conceptualization, and practice, which is an important learning mode in science education. However, learners generally do not have opportunities to experience many scientific phenomena in the real world. Therefore, virtual learning environ-ments (VLE) are becoming a frequently adopted technology to provide authentic learning con-texts. In particular, spherical video-based learning environments (SVLE), which are a low-tech form of VLE, have attracted the attention of school teachers and educational technology re-searchers. Additionally, effective assessment methods, such as the two-tier-test, have been adopted to examine learners' performance during the virtual learning process. On the other hand, researchers have pointed out that lack of effective learning strategies may decrease the learning effects in a virtual learning context. Hence, this study integrated a graphic organizer into a two-tier test-based learning mode, in which the first-tier questions were declarative items with a short answer (e.g., the questions of where, what, and when), whereas the second-tier questions were more in-depth, deeper causal-type questions (e.g., the questions of why and how), in the contexts of SVLE. To verify the effectiveness of this learning approach, a graphic organizer-based two-tier test SVLE was developed; moreover, a quasi-experimental design was conducted in the "Mysteries of the Earth" unit of the sixth graders' natural science course. A total of 41 sixth graders from two classes, with an average age of 12, were recruited in this experiment. One class was assigned to be the experimental group adopting the graphic organizer-based two-tier test SVLE (GT-SVLE), while the other was the control group adopting the conventional two-tier test-based SVLE (CT-SVLE). All of the students learned with the SVLE using tablet computers. Based on the results, the GT-SVLE could better improve students' learning achievement than the CT-SVLE. Besides, accord-ing to behavioral analysis and interviews, the control group had significantly more learning be-haviors of repeated reading of supplementary materials and repeated wrong answers, indicating that the proposed approach facilitated students' positive behaviors through observation and knowledge construction in SVLE, which helped them achieve the learning objectives.

AB  - Clinicians often encounter patients having complex clinical scenarios (CCS) where diverse and dynamic diagnostic and therapeutic issues interact. A limited range of bedside methods are available to describe such patients and most often it is a diagnostic summary, a problem list, or a list of differential diagnoses. These methods fail to portray the interconnected nature of CCCs. They prevent visualization of a system of networks or a web of causation operative in CCSs.
   A more holistic conceptualization is required and the author argues for an approach based on systems science. The latter views the human body to consist of several closely linked organ systems, constantly interacting with each other and embedded in, and 'open' to the external environment. In order to capture the systems nature at bedside, a tool based on network diagrams, termed a Clinical Reasoning Map (CRM) is proposed which depicts diseases or conditions as nodes linked to each other by lines or arrows. The latter linkages follow simple rules: possible causes or associations as mere lines; probable cause using a single dotted arrow with directionality (from `cause' to `effect'); definite causal pathways by directional arrows; and bi-directional arrows to indicate organs-systems influencing each other.
   CRM's utility was investigated in several groups of undergraduate medical students. The results varied: 289, 5th year and 4th year medical students showed that 245 (85.5 %) perceived CRM improve their understanding of the case. However, there was no clear advantage in the CRM over a list of diagnoses in recall of key information. A majority (83.9 %) were keen to learn the technique of drawing a CRM. Postgraduates too found the tool to be useful to understand the interconnected nature of real-life complex case scenarios and pathogenesis of their multifaceted condition to generate differential diagnosis and to select appropriate investigations. Effectiveness of CRM is supported by adult learning theories such as meaningful learning and experiential learning.
   The author proposes that systems science and tools based in this approach such as CRM has utility in understanding and managing complex case scenarios. They differ significantly from other diagrammatic methods available in the medical literature.

AB  - The objective of the study is to analyze the effect of three dimensional (3D) virtual environment and augmented reality applications on learning achievement. In line with this purpose, experimental studies were considered and the effects of experimental and control groups on learning achievement analyzed. In the experimental group, the applications which were established through the 3D virtual environment and augmented reality technologies while control group consisted of face to face environment. In order to realize this aim, the meta-analysis method used in educational sciences was preferred. Key words for 3D virtual environments meta-analysis scanning are: '''3D virtual world" & achievement' and '''3D virtual environment" & achievement'. And the key word determined for the augmented reality meta- analysis scanning is '''augmented reality" & achievement'. Within the context of the research, the databases such as Science Direct, ERIC, Taylor & Francis, EBSCO, Emerald, JSTOR, SAGE, SpringerLink and Google Scholar were analyzed. The determined keywords were entered into the aforementioned databases and 4.682 articles published between 2010 and 2016 were controlled in terms of their conformity to the objectives of the research. After the initial analysis, 47 articles were determined on 3D virtual environment while 57 articles were on the augmented reality. Among the 47 articles on 3D virtual environments, 20 articles which conform to the inclusion criteria were determined and 24 articles among the 57 articles on augmented reality were employed for meta-analysis. The dependent variable of the research is learning achievement while independent variable is experimental and control groups. Education level was determined as the moderator variable in the research. According to the results of the research, it was found that 3D virtual environments had moderate levels of effect on learning achievement on behalf of the experimental group (d=0.32). similar to those results, augmented reality applications had also moderate level of effect on learning achievement on behalf of experimental group (d=0.46). According to the results of the moderator analysis conducted, it was determined that the selection of the study sample as undergraduate, primary school, high school and secondary school did not change the effect size of the 3D virtual environments on the learning success. Again, according to the results of the moderator analysis, it was determined that the selection of the study sample as a secondary school, primary school and graduate did not change the effect size of the augmented reality applications on the learning success.

AB  - Because of the increasing heterogeneity among students in classes and schools, determining a student's basic learning status and ability in each subject and tailoring instruction or adapting remedial teaching to a student's needs and characteristics have become challenging, especially for those students with learning disadvantages. According to Skinner's behavioral learning theory (as cited in Gregory, 1987), differences in a student's learning experiences (such as in understanding concepts) lead to considerable disparities in future learning. Drastic differences in internal cognition and concept structure may exist even among students with the same traditional learning achievements (i.e., scores) (Yu & Yu, 2006). Furthermore, the differences in concept cognition structure between experts and novices may be discoverable by analyzing similarities in students' conceptual understandings, relationships, or psychological metrics (Brand-Gruwel et al., 2005; Hsu et al., 2012).
   Cognitive diagnostic models, such as the knowledge map, are useful for assessing a student's conceptual knowledge structures and misconceptions to improve differentiated teaching, learning diagnosis, and remedial teaching (Chu et al., 2014; Hwang, Shi et al., 2011; Hwang, Wu et al., 2011; Ku et al., 2014; Lou et al., 2007; Lwo et al., 2013; Ting & Kuo, 2016). However, most such models have been constructed using only vertical hierarchical structures, wherein spotting multilateral correlations or influences between subjects or concepts proves difficult. Unlike an expert, a student cannot intuitively identify the multilateral correlations between the concepts involved a learning pathway, and analyzing novice learning is challenging and requires considerable time and effort.
   An adaptive mechanism for diagnosing and analyzing students' dynamic learning behaviors and learning pathways could improve autonomous learning and remedial teaching. However, most existing mechanisms cannot offer adaptive or personalized learning content or pathways to the learner (Singhal, 2012; Ting & Kuo, 2016; Wang et al., 2019).
   With the advantages provided by information technologies such as big data analytics and artificial intelligence, large-scale heterogeneous data analysis, cloud computing, and Knowledge Graphs (KGs) with directionally linked data structures have been widely applied in recommendation systems to facilitate the representation of knowledge structures and to mine for new knowledge that helps to meets users' needs (Deng et al., 2019; Fensel et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2019; Jia et al., 2018; Nickel et al., 2016; Noy et al., 2019; Yu et al., 2020). Similar to tree-structured knowledge maps, KGs are based on directional or nondirectional ontological graphs composed of concept nodes and relationship edges and employ the consensus opinions of Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) to generate consolidated KGs or generate KGs automatically from large mined data sets or text. The associated reasoning mechanism is used to make inferences based on the existing concepts and relationships among them. Among all the graph-building options, Petri-Net possess the most robust capabilities for graphical workflow presentation and pathway analysis (Peterson, 1981; Tan & Zhou, 2013). They have long been widely applied in adaptive learning and learning pathway recommendation.
   According to information published by the Taiwan Bureau of Foreign Trade and Taiwan Electrical and Electronic Manufacturers' Association in 2020, the electrical and electronics industry accounted for 50.59% of Taiwan's total export value in 2019. The foundational electricity course is an important core course for future electrical and Electronic Engineering (EE) study and can be the first obstacle for novices because of the intricate relationships among its knowledge concepts. Also, significant differences may exist in individual understandings of concept structures (Dai, 2015).
   To address the aforementioned challenges in learning diagnostics and remedial teaching, this study was based on learning theories such as the conditions of learning, constructivism, and scaffolding theory and utilized Petri-Net to achieve the following goals:
   1. Use a Petri-Net to construct a KG visualizing a foundational electricity course.
   2. Conduct a pilot study to identify personal learning pathways, interrelationships among foundational electricity concepts, and misconceptions regarding novices' learning types.
   3. Use students' learning history to predict their learning effectiveness when studying future concepts and maximize their learning outcomes.
   4. Recommend an adaptive, calibrated, personalized learning pathway for further remedial teaching and learning.
   In this study, we employed a three-round modified Delphi technique with 18 SMEs to identify 12 subjects, 58 concepts, and 95 corresponding interrelationships within a core foundational electricity course in EE. We utilized a Petri-Net with graphic features to construct a KG we called a Petri-Net KG.
   After the third round of the modified Delphi technique, all eight SMEs' Content Validity Indexes (CVI) were 1.00. Cronbach's a was .75. The SMEs' opinions regarding the interrelationships of concepts exhibited good internal consistency and reliability, according to 95% confidence intervals. The correlations between concept weights were .83-.96 (p<.01). Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICCs) were used to confirm the consistency of SMEs' opinions on the weights of the interrelationships between concepts. ICC (1) was.072, and ICC (2) was .75. All the SMEs' opinions exhibited significant and strong correlations and good consistency.
   Using 947 students' assessment records, learning portfolios, and learning status data (e.g. conditions of learning performance, scores), the reasoning engine was used to employ the KGs for learning transfer analysis. Preliminary exploration case studies were conducted to create Petri-Net KGs personalized for students with three different learning types (insufficiently hardworking, inadequate learning, and abnormal learning) and to determine their learning progress and status. Sato's student-problem chart was used to classify students' learning types.
   The major results and findings of this study are as follows:
   1. The most important concept was circuit patterns and characteristics, affecting the learning of the subsequent 12 concepts, and the total impact was 6. Units, vector operations, and voltage-in that order-were the next most important concepts.
   2. The proposed Petri-Net KG provided students with visualized learning scaffoldings that indicate the experts' consensus cognitive structure. It also clarified any prior concepts requisite for understanding each concept.
   3. By utilizing the weights of the interrelationships between concepts and their prior concepts, the reasoning engine could adaptively diagnose misconceptions and further predict students' effectiveness in learning subsequent concepts.
   4. Each learning type was associated with a unique cognitive structure. Integrating students' learning portfolio data into the proposed Petri-Net KG enabled the reasoning engine to recommend an adaptive and personalized learning pathway.
   The aforementioned results have the following implications for future applications and research:
   1. The visualized Petri-Net KG for the foundational electricity course could clearly depict learning types, experts' consensus knowledge structure, and students' personal cognitive structures. Additionally, most influential concepts were observable at a glance. Such KGs could be useful for guiding concept recognition and effectively diagnosing misconceptions.
   2. The personalized learning pathways and content recommended by the Petri-Net KG and reasoning engine can be used in a self-tutoring platform. The weighted concept intercorrelations and student learning data can be analyzed to determine students' cognitive conditions according to an expert KG. Thus, a model or student learning effectiveness can be established to strengthen the effectiveness of autonomous learning or remedial teaching.
   The framework of this course-level Petri-Net KG can be extended and applied to other curricula, disciplines, or educational levels to develop appropriate recommendation systems for competency development.
