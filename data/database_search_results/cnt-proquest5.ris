T1  - Roles, applications, and trends of concept map-supported learning: a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of publications from 1992 to 2020 in selected educational technology journals
AN  - 2896048543
AB  - ABSTRACTThis study investigates the roles, applications, and trends of concept map-supported education (CMSE) by reviewing the studies published from 1992 to 2020. Several dimensions, such as the media of concept maps, roles of concepts, sample groups, research methods, application domains, learning contexts, research foci, as well as the citation and co-citation relationships, are taken into account based on the technology-based learning model. From the review results, two thematic clusters were found, namely concept map-facilitated knowledge construction in collaborative learning, and concept map-based learning design to improve learning achievement and motivation. The research focused more on the applications in engineering courses, followed by science and language courses, and potential was also found in arts, business or management, and mathematics. Learning contexts for CMSE are mainly in-class activities, followed by online discussion activities; moreover, it was found that the number of applications in digital game-based learning contexts is increasing. In terms of research foci, more studies investigated learners’ performance, attitude/motivation, and perceptions, while less emphasis was put on developing learners’ skills, higher order thinking, as well as collaboration and communication competences. Accordingly, several suggestions for future research of CMSE are provided as a reference for researchers and policy makers.

T1  - Associating spatial knowledge with concept maps to facilitate learning in digital gaming contexts
AN  - 2895064239
AB  - In conventional digital game-based learning, geographic maps are generally used to provide students with the whole picture of the gaming contexts, while the concepts to be learned are separately presented as individual gaming objects. Scholars have indicated the problems of such a gaming content design, in which students could encounter difficulties making effective connections between spatial and conceptual knowledge during the learning process, which may influence their learning effectiveness. As a result, it is a crucial and challenging issue to assist students in organizing spatial and conceptual knowledge in contextual learning environments, such as digital games. To solve this problem, an integrated concept map and geographic map-based digital gaming (CM-GMDG) approach is proposed to demonstrate how spatial and conceptual knowledge can be connected in the development of digital games. To investigate the effectiveness of the approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in a social science course. Two classes of seventh graders in a high school participated in this study. The experimental group (N = 39) adopted the CM-GMDG approach while the control group (N = 23) adopted the conventional geographic map-based digital gaming (GMDG) approach. The results showed that the students using the CM-GMDG approach significantly outperformed those using the GMDG approach on learning achievement. Moreover, the learning behavioral pattern analysis results showed that compared with the control group, students in the experimental group more frequently engaged in knowledge-acquiring behaviors, such as reading learning materials and completing learning tasks. On the other hand, the control group gave up on the learning tasks more frequently by switching the gaming scenes and stopping answering questions. This indicated that the CM-GMDG approach was more helpful for guiding students to focus on their learning tasks than the GMDG approach.

T1  - Effect of retrieval practice and drawing on high school students’ conceptual understanding of the carbon cycle
AN  - 2886463586
AB  - Both learner-generated drawing and retrieval practice methods are effective to enhance science learning. To compare the impact of combining different drawing methods (representational drawing vs. abstract drawing) with retrieval practice on the carbon cycle learning, 136 Chinese high school students enrolled in a geography course were assigned randomly to six learning conditions: students built their mental models of the carbon cycle by either generating sketches with or without access to the text learning material introducing the carbon cycle (i.e., generative sketching vs. retrieval sketching), or by creating concept maps with or without access to the learning material (i.e., generative concept mapping vs. retrieval concept mapping), or students just freely recalled on what they have learned from the learning material by paragraphing (i.e., retrieval practice), or restudied the learning material with note-taking (i.e., restudy). Students’ learning outcomes were assessed by immediate and one-week delayed tests. Results revealed that no difference was found between the six conditions on the immediate test, whereas students in the retrieval practice condition with paragraphing significantly outperformed those who did not practice retrieval on the one-week delayed test. However, there was no difference between the two drawing conditions regardless of whether they were adopted with or without retrieval practice. Furthermore, the same pattern was found on the factual knowledge questions in both tests, but no main effect of condition was found on both the immediate and the delayed tests for the application questions. We conclude that retrieval-based drawing could be adopted for climate change education at the high school level.

T1  - An integrated approach for knowledge extraction and analysis in collaborative knowledge construction: Revista de Universidad y Sociedad del Conocimiento
AN  - 2843974519
AB  - Collaborative knowledge construction (CKC) involved students’ sharing of information, improvement of ideas, and construction of collective knowledge. In this process, knowledge extraction and analysis can provide valuable insights into students’ knowledge capacities, depths, and levels in order to improve the CKC quality. However, existing studies tended to extract and analyze knowledge from a single perspective (e.g., the number of certain knowledge types and knowledge structures), which failed to demonstrate the complexity and dynamics of knowledge construction and advancement. To fill this gap, this research designed a series of computer-supported collaborative concept mapping (CSCCM) activities to facilitate students’ CKC process and then used an integrated approach (i.e., semantic knowledge analysis combined with learning analytics) to extract, analyze, and understand students’ knowledge characteristics and evolutionary trends. Results demonstrated that compared to the low-performing pairs, the high-performing pairs mainly discussed knowledge related to the course content, and their knowledge evolution trend was relatively stable. Based on the results, this research provided analytical implications to extract, analyze, and understand students’ knowledge and pedagogical implications to promote students’ knowledge construction and advancement.

T1  - The Evolving Landscape of Antibody–Drug Conjugates: In Depth Analysis of Recent Research Progress
AN  - 2891169701
AB  - Antibody–drug conjugates (ADCs) are targeted immunoconjugate constructs that integrate the potency of cytotoxic drugs with the selectivity of monoclonal antibodies, minimizing damage to healthy cells and reducing systemic toxicity. Their design allows for higher doses of the cytotoxic drug to be administered, potentially increasing efficacy. They are currently among the most promising drug classes in oncology, with efforts to expand their application for nononcological indications and in combination therapies. Here we provide a detailed overview of the recent advances in ADC research and consider future directions and challenges in promoting this promising platform to widespread therapeutic use. We examine data from the CAS Content Collection, the largest human-curated collection of published scientific information, and analyze the publication landscape of recent research to reveal the exploration trends in published documents and to provide insights into the scientific advances in the area. We also discuss the evolution of the key concepts in the field, the major technologies, and their development pipelines with company research focuses, disease targets, development stages, and publication and investment trends. A comprehensive concept map has been created based on the documents in the CAS Content Collection. We hope that this report can serve as a useful resource for understanding the current state of knowledge in the field of ADCs and the remaining challenges to fulfill their potential.

T1  - Teachers’ Knowledge of Learning Strategies
AN  - 2853697363
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how pre- and in-service teachers (N = 346) evaluate different learning strategies for six scenarios, and how they justify their answers. Results showed that teachers mostly evaluate strategies found to be effective in previous empirical studies as more effective and they can provide proper scientific justifications, though some justifications included misconceptions. Teachers were most confused when comparing interleaving versus blocking and retrieval versus concept mapping. Configural frequency analysis showed that justifications were generally, but not always, consistent with evaluations. These findings refer to the importance of examining teacher knowledge both with evaluations and with open-end questions. Misconceptions identified by justifications comprise useful information for planning teacher-training courses.

T1  - Student Competition (Knowledge Generation) ID 1985014: A concept mapping approach to develOP a ToolkIt to iMprove medicAtion self-management for persons with spinaL cord injury (OPTIMAL-SCI)
AN  - 2898418864
AB  - BackgroundAdults with spinal cord injury/dysfunction (SCI/D) are commonly prescribed multiple medications to manage secondary complications. Significant challenges managing medications have been highlighted, with the need for more support with medication self-management.ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to co-develop a toolkit to assist with medication self-management for persons with SCI/D.MethodsAdults with SCI/D, caregivers, and healthcare providers will participate in the three steps of concept mapping – brainstorming, sorting and rating, and mapping to identify key components of the toolkit. Participants will generate statements about what should be incorporated into a toolkit to help persons with SCI/D manage their medications. Participants will rate the final list of statements on importance and feasibility and sort the statements into thematic piles. A visual map will be developed by a subset of participants, representing the thematic piles.FindingsTo date, participants have generated over 500 statements. Ideas generated around the content of the toolkit focus on information about: pharmacological and non-pharmacological options for managing secondary complications, side effects, communicating with providers, and medication access. Ideas specific to the delivery of the toolkit focus on: ensuring an individualized approach, accessibility, and the use of visuals. Statements will be synthesized for sorting and rating and mapping.ConclusionSubsequent phases of this research will refine the toolkit through interviews and input from our working group. A mixed methods pilot evaluation will then be conducted to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and appropriateness of the toolkit, as well medication knowledge, self-efficacy, and quality of life.

T1  - A mixed method analysis of student satisfaction with active learning techniques in an online graduate anatomy course: Consideration of demographics and previous course enrollment
AN  - 2860263381
AB  - Online learning has become an essential part of mainstream higher education. With increasing enrollments in online anatomy courses, a better understanding of effective teaching techniques for the online learning environment is critical. Active learning has previously shown many benefits in face‐to‐face anatomy courses, including increases in student satisfaction. Currently, no research has measured student satisfaction with active learning techniques implemented in an online graduate anatomy course. This study compares student satisfaction across four different active learning techniques (jigsaw, team‐learning module, concept mapping, and question constructing), with consideration of demographics and previous enrollment in anatomy and/or online courses. Survey questions consisted of Likert‐style, multiple‐choice, ranking, and open‐ended questions that asked students to indicate their level of satisfaction with the active learning techniques. One hundred seventy Medical Science master's students completed the online anatomy course and all seven surveys. Results showed that students were significantly more satisfied with question constructing and jigsaw than with concept mapping and team‐learning module. Additionally, historically excluded groups (underrepresented racial minorities) were generally more satisfied with active learning than non‐minority groups. Age, gender, and previous experience with anatomy did not influence the level of satisfaction. However, students with a higher‐grade point average (GPA), those with only a bachelor's degree, and those with no previous online course experience were more satisfied with active learning than students who had a lower GPA, those holding a graduate/professional degree, and those with previous online course experience. Cumulatively, these findings support the beneficial use of active learning in online anatomy courses.

T1  - The impact of pain neuroscience education in a Hispanic-American population: A mixed-methods exploratory study
AN  - 2845353249
AB  - BackgroundChronic pain and pain catastrophization are growing problems across the United States, within the Hispanic-American population. Pain neuroscience education (PNE) changes pain knowledge and beliefs in many populations, but its impact on reconceptualization in people of Hispanic-American origin is unknown.PurposeExplore the changes in pain knowledge in Hispanic-American individuals and the process involved in reconceptualization following a PNE lecture.MethodsEight Hispanic-American adults participated in a mixed-methods exploratory study. The Revised Neurophysiology of Pain Questionnaire (R-NPQ) was completed before, immediately after, and eight months after an adapted PNE lecture. A focus group involving four participants discussed the impact of PNE. Transcripts were translated and theme coded, and a concept map was developed by consensus.ResultsR-NPQ scores improved from 25.3% to 43.5% post-lecture, and the number of unsure responses decreased from 41.5% to 18.4%. At eight months, R-NPQ scores remained stable (44.2%) but unsure responses increased (28.9%). Themes that contributed to the process of change included cognitive dissonance, relevance of instruction, idea exchange through peer interaction, reflection, confidence, changed behaviors, and educational utility.ConclusionWhile small improvements in knowledge and perception of pain appeared to occur with the PNE, knowledge remained low. Consideration of adult learning principles such as applicability, peer-interaction, the confrontation of beliefs, and reflection throughout PNE may enhance its impact. Future investigation should explore the efficacy of this intervention, when compared or combined with other techniques in the treatment of Hispanic-Americans experiencing persistent pain.

T1  - A COVID-19 Roadmap to Promote Health Literacy Derived from the Atlas of Science Literacy
AN  - 2849319710
AB  - Currently, the world needs health-literate citizens who are able to make informed decisions about COVID-19 and other diseases. Here, we propose a COVID-19 roadmap consisting of four commented maps about infection, diagnosis, defense, treatment, and prevention. We built the maps based on those from the Atlas of Science Literacy following a qualitative methodology. Main ideas about health linked to COVID-19 and how they relate to each other can be visualized in the maps in an organized structure and according to K-levels. The maps are accompanied by a text that relates the health ideas to the COVID-19 disease. This tool can be used to promote health education and, ultimately, health literacy through the teaching and learning of COVID-19.

T1  - To ask better questions, teach: Learning-by-teaching enhances research question generation more than retrieval practice and concept-mapping
AN  - 2843888306
AB  - Asking good questions is vital for scientific learning and discovery, but improving this complex skill is a formidable challenge. Here, we show in two experiments (N = 152) that teaching others-learning-by-teaching-enhances one's ability to generate higher-order research questions that create new knowledge, relative to two other well-established generative learning techniques: retrieval practice and concept-mapping. Learners who taught scientific expository texts across natural and social sciences topics by delivering video-recorded lectures outperformed their peers who practiced retrieval or constructed concept maps when tested on their ability to generate create-level research questions based on the texts (Experiment 1). This advantage held reliably even on a delayed test 48 hr later, and when all learners similarly received and responded to poststudy questions on the material (Experiment 2). Moreover, across both immediate and delayed tests, learning-by-teaching produced a recall benefit that rivaled that of the potent technique of retrieval practice. In contrast, despite recalling more than twice the study content that the concept-mapping group did, learners who practiced retrieval were unable to generate more create-level research questions based on that content. Three supplemental experiments (N = 168) further showed that retrieval practice consistently did not improve higher-order question generation over restudying, despite yielding superior long-term retention. Altogether, these findings reveal that simply possessing a wealth of factual knowledge is insufficient for generating higher-order research questions that create new knowledge. Rather, teaching others is a powerful strategy for producing deep and durable learning that enables research question generation. To ask better questions, teach.

T1  - Lipids and Proteins: Worksheets, Concept Maps, and Safe Experiments
AN  - 2838766426
AB  - The purpose of this article is to describe the possibilities of using worksheets in the teaching of lipids and proteins. The worksheet includes a concept map, suggestions for three safe experiments that can be performed with available household chemicals, and observation results. The worksheets were implemented into action research in two classes taught by the same teacher. The verification of the worksheets took 90 min. First, the students filled out the prediction cards, structured the concepts related to the topic of the worksheet, verified the worksheet, wrote the results of the verification, and finally, after performing the experiments, filled in the prediction cards again. It was found that students have a problem with the interpretation of the data and many of them lack the skills needed to carry out the experiment. The knowledge at the beginning and at the end of the lesson was verified by deciding on the truth of the statements on the prediction card. For lipids, students' input knowledge was 57% and output knowledge was 81%, while for proteins, students' input knowledge was 66% and output knowledge was 91%. The combination of work with a conceptual map and the implementation of experiments led to the consolidation of knowledge in these two thematic units of biochemistry.

T1  - Effect of 5E learning cycle assisted with concept maps on conceptual understanding
AN  - 2890025943
AB  - This study aims to examine the effect of conceptual understandings related to anion-cation, acid-base, ionic-covalent, metal-nonmetal, and number of protons-number of electrons concept pairs taught in the periodic table to 8th grade students with the 5E learning model supported by concept maps. The study was conducted among 100 (50 in the experimental group and 50 in the control group) 8th grade students in North Cyprus in the second term of the 2018-2019 academic year. Data was collected using the chemistry concept diagnostic test, open-ended questions, and semi-structured interviews related to the concept pairs designed by the researchers. As a result of the study, it has been determined that the 5E learning model supported by concept maps improves the students’ conceptual understanding, and the opinions of students from the experimental group on the learning environment have been analyzed.

T1  - Enhancing memory recall during video lectures: does the visual display format matter?
AN  - 2864014561
AB  - Lectures containing information presented in verbal and visual form are widely used in educational settings. To date, little is known about how the visual display in a video lecture influences immediate and delayed recall. In two experiments, participants listened to a pre-recorded lecture while viewing an animated concept map, sequential listing of bulleted text, or there was no visual display. Results indicated that the concept map lecture enhanced immediate recall accuracy; however, the type of ideas recalled is also important to consider. Compared to the listen-only lecture, the concept map and bulleted text lectures promoted more recall of main ideas rather than details. Finally, the concept map lecture mainly benefitted those with high prior science achievement. These findings suggest that the visual display in a video lecture may affect the type of ideas remembered, and prior knowledge should be considered when choosing how to present information in a video lecture.

T1  - The impact of chatbots using concept maps on correction outcomes–a case study of programming courses
AN  - 2832636832
AB  - With the development of science and technology, the demand for programmers has increased. However, learning computer programs is not an easy task. It might cause a significant impact on programming if misconceptions exist at the beginning of the study. Hence, it is important to discover and correct them immediately. Chatbots are effective teaching aids, they can assist students in eliminating misconceptions. They also assist teachers to instruct students according to their aptitude, which teachers found it hard to accomplish without technical supports when teaching in large classes. Therefore, this experiment uses chatbots to assist learners in the correction phase. We consider that learners who failed unit quizzes might have misunderstandings in programming concepts. We believe chatbots can teach according to individual misunderstandings and give correct responses to their unclear concepts. It is more effective than traditional teaching methods. In addition, to prevent human-computer interaction barriers, such as picking wrong keywords and giving plausible replies, or learners not being able to express their problems clearly, this experiment also adds concept maps to the chatbots’ dialogue, to work as the dialogue structure for each chatbot. The maps help the chatbots to explain concepts in each unit systematically and logically. The chatbots give questions according to the concepts on the concept maps and ask learners to reply with their answers. An ANCOVA test investigated students’ scores. Result showed the p-value is below 0.001, indicating that the group using concept map chatbots has better correction effects than the other group using only concept maps.

T1  - Diagrams, images and conceptual maps in nursing education
AN  - 2830046912
AB  - The way in which one understands information and concepts, and the way a student works to develop this, is an individual aspect of learning that cannot be universally defined as (at least manifested) the same for everyone. ‘Understanding’ is a broad term, and the way one achieves understanding is dependent on the way that material is presented. In this article, we argue that the philosophy of science can be important to nursing education—in particular, by showing that the way we imbue understanding might depend on the meaning of ‘understanding’. Diagrams and concept maps are meant to guide newly formed knowledge and connections to develop proper thinking (e.g., the order in which nursing students must prioritize data) that a student requires in the field. We argue that whether or not an image/diagram/concept map confers understanding will depend on both what the object is and what we mean by ‘understanding’.

T1  - Academic achievement and intrinsic motivation in higher education students: an analysis of the impact of using concept maps
AN  - 2795263670
AB  - PurposeThe study investigates meaningful learning among higher education students using concept maps (CM) as a learning strategy. The main goals were to understand whether the introduction of CM produced changes in students' academic achievement and intrinsic motivation (IM).Design/methodology/approachIn this quasi-experimental study, academic achievement was collected using achievement tests made in-class, IM through a self-reported questionnaire and the usefulness of CM using an interview. The research sample consisted of 60 undergraduate students enrolled in the first year of an undergraduate occupational therapy (OT) program of a Portuguese polytechnic institute in two different consecutive academic years. Students were assigned to 2 groups (experimental group (EG) – 23 and control group – 37). CM were introduced in the pedagogical process of the EG.FindingsCM produced better academic achievement in the EG. Nevertheless, groups presented a decrease in the levels of IM over time.Practical implicationsThe paper includes implications for the development of CM as a learning strategy to improve students' learning and academic achievement.Originality/valueThis paper fulfills an identified need to investigate the double impact of CM on academic achievement and IM in higher education students.

T1  - Investigating the network structure of domain-specific knowledge using the semantic fluency task
AN  - 2785266424
AB  - Cognitive scientists have a long-standing interest in quantifying the structure of semantic memory. Here, we investigate whether a commonly used paradigm to study the structure of semantic memory, the semantic fluency task, as well as computational methods from network science could be leveraged to explore the underlying knowledge structures of academic disciplines such as psychology or biology. To compare the knowledge representations of individuals with relatively different levels of expertise in academic subjects, undergraduate students (i.e., experts) and preuniversity high school students (i.e., novices) completed a semantic fluency task with cue words corresponding to general semantic categories (i.e., animals, fruits) and specific academic domains (e.g., psychology, biology). Network analyses of their fluency networks found that both domaingeneral and domain-specific semantic networks of undergraduates were more efficiently connected and less modular than the semantic networks of high school students. Our results provide an initial proof-of-concept that the semantic fluency task could be used by educators and cognitive scientists to study the representation of more specific domains of knowledge, potentially providing new ways of quantifying the nature of expert cognitive representations.

T1  - Teaching and Assessing Systems Thinking in First-Year Chemistry
AN  - 2787930074
AB  - Powerful arguments have been made recently to advocate for the introduction of systems thinking in chemistry education to equip graduates to address sustainability challenges. This contribution describes systems thinking activities and an assessment tool that enables meaningful learning in first-year organic chemistry as students engage with the molecular-level foundation and real-world implications of the system under consideration. The activity incorporates concept maps and systems-oriented concept mapping extensions (SOCMEs) as visualization tools to scaffold the development of systems thinking skills. A rubric based on the SOLO taxonomy was designed and used to assess evidence of systems thinking skills demonstrated on SOCMEs. The activity was implemented in a small and a large group of 18 and 219 participants respectively, where findings from both groups are presented. The grading of six SOCMEs by three independent raters proved to be inconsistent at higher thinking SOLO levels, where rater experience was flagged as an area for future improvement to ensure raters are proficient in assessing systems thinking. However, meaningful progress was made to assess the quality of learning. The rubric was an effective tool for formative and low-stakes assessment to drive the teaching and learning of systems thinking in chemistry.

T1  - Using CREATE and Scientific Literature to Teach Chemistry
AN  - 2777765646
AB  - The use of primary literature can be an effective way to expose students to the scientific research process. At the same time, primary literature can be intimidating to many students, particularly those with limited exposure to science research. The CREATE (consider, read, elucidate hypotheses, analyze and interpret the data, and think of the next experiment) method is an evidence-based teaching strategy that uses a structured series of pedagogical tools to allow students to perform intensive analysis of primary literature. The use of CREATE in biology classes increased student self-rated attitudes, confidence, and understanding of science. On the basis of these prior reports, we implemented CREATE in a one-semester, stand-alone, undergraduate chemistry course in which students analyzed a linked series of primary literature articles tracking the trajectory of a specific area of chemistry research. The course was aimed at second-year students, and our goals were to increase student confidence in engaging scientific literature, demystify the scientific process, and help students see themselves as having a role in that process. Pre- and post-course surveys indicated significant increases in understanding of the scientific process, along with gains in self-rated skills and attitudes related to science. Students also demonstrated gains in course content knowledge as assessed by a pre- and post-course concept mapping exercise. Thus, the CREATE method has been implemented in a chemistry teaching context that resulted in increased student knowledge.

T1  - Co-developing a health promotion programme for indigenous youths in Brazil: A concept mapping report
AN  - 2776985599
AB  - Background 
Latin America and the Caribbean Region are home to about 42 million Indigenous people, with about 900,000 living in Brazil. The little routinely collected population-level data from Indigenous communities in the region available shows stark inequities in health and well-being. There are 305 Indigenous ethnic groups, speaking 274 languages, spread across the remote national territory, who have endured long-lasting inequities related to poverty, poor health, and limited access to health care. Malnutrition and mental health are key concerns for young people. Building on our Indigenous communities-academic partnerships over the last two decades, we collaborated with young people from the Terena Indigenous ethnic group, village leaders, teachers, parents, and local health practitioners from the Polo Base (community health centres) to obtain their perspectives on important and feasible actions for a youth health promotion programme.
 Methods 
The report was conducted in the Tereré Village in Mato Grosso do Sul. Concept mapping, a participatory mixed method approach, was conducted in 7 workshops, 15 adults and 40 youths aged 9–17 years. Art-based concept mapping was used with 9 to 11 years old children (N = 20). Concept systems software was used to create concept maps, which were finalised during the workshops. Focused prompts related to factors that may influence the health and happiness of youths. The participatory method gave Terena youths a significant voice in shaping an agenda that can improve their health.
 Results 
Terena youths identified priority actions that clustered under ‘Family’, ‘School’, ‘Education’, ‘Socio-economic circumstances’, ‘Respect’ and ‘Sport’ in response to protecting happiness; and ‘Nutrition pattern’, ‘Physical activity’, ‘Local environment’, and ‘Well-being’ in response to having a healthy body. Through the participatory lens of concept mapping, youths articulated the interconnectedness of priority actions across these clusters such that behaviours (e.g. Nutrition pattern, drinking water, physical activity) and aspirations (being able to read, to have a good job) were recognised to be dependent on a wider ecology of factors (e.g. loss of eco-systems, parent-child relationships, student- teacher relationships, parental unemployment). In response to developing youth health, Terena adults suggested priority actions that clustered under ‘Relationships’, ‘Health issues’, ‘Prevention at Polo Base’, ‘Access to health care’, ‘Communication with young people’, ‘Community life’, ‘Raising awareness’ and ‘School support’. Their priorities reflected the need for structural transformative actions (e.g. Polo Base and school staff working together) and for embedding actions to protect Indigenous culture (e.g. integrating their cultural knowledge into training programmes).
 Conclusions 
Concept maps of Indigenous youths emphasised the need for a health promotion programme that engages with the structural and social determinants of health to protect their happiness and health, whilst those of adults emphasised the need to address specific health issues through preventative care via a school-Polo Base collaboration. Investment in a co-developed school-Polo-Base health promotion programme, with intersectoral engagement, has potential for making Indigenous health systems responsive to the inequalities of youth health, to yield dividends for healthy ageing trajectories as well as for the health of the next generation.

T1  - The effects of project-supported education about food production on teacher candidates’ systems thinking skills
AN  - 2879254170
AB  - Sistem düşüncesi, belirli bir amaç için birbirine bağlı parçaların etkileşimli çalışmasıdır. Küresel gıda üretim süreçleri, sürdürülebilirlik, ekonomi, mühendislik, doğa ve sosyal boyutları içerir. Bu açıdan öğretmen adaylarının sistem düşünme becerilerinin geliştirilmesi önemlidir. Bu çalışmanın amacı, proje destekli eğitimin öğretmen adaylarının gıda üretimine yönelik sistem düşünme becerilerine etkisini incelemektir. Araştırmada karma araştırma deseni ve tek grup ön test-son test deneysel desen kullanılmıştır. Veriler, sistem düşüncesi beceri testi, açık uçlu sorular ve kavram haritalarından elde edilmiştir. Araştırmanın nicel çalışma grubu 100, nitel çalışma grubu ise 30 fen bilgisi öğretmen adayından oluşmuştur. Sistem beceri testi ön test ve son test arasında anlamlı bir fark olduğu bulunmuştur. Öğretmen adaylarının geliştirdikleri kavram haritaları, sistemin yapısını, işlevini ve davranışını anlama düzeyleri ve gıda üretimi ile ilgili sektörler arasında bağlantı kurup kuramamaları açısından değerlendirilmiştir. Araştırmada sistem düşüncesi beceri testi ve kavram haritalarının sistem düşüncesi becerilerini tespit etmede etkili olduğu bulunmuştur. Bu çalışmanın en önemli bulgusu sistem düşüncesinin en temel özelliği olan sistemlerin birbirine bağımlılığının anlaşılması olmuştur.Alternate abstract: Systems thinking is the interactive working of interconnected parts for a specific purpose. Global food production processes include sustainability, economics, engineering, nature and social dimensions. In this respect, it is important to develop the systems thinking skills of teacher candidates. This study aimed to examine the effect of project-supported education on the system thinking skills of teacher candidates on food production. A mixed research design and single-group pre-test-post-test experimental design were used in the research. The data were obtained from the systems thinking skill test, open-ended questions and concept maps. The quantitative study group of the research consisted of 100, and the qualitative study group consisted of 30 science teacher candidates. It was found that there was a significant difference between the system skill test pre-test and post-test. The concept maps developed by the teacher candidates were evaluated in terms of their level of understanding of the system's structure, function and behaviour and whether they could establish a link between the sectors related to food production. In the research, it was found that systems thinking skill tests and concept maps were effective in detecting systems thinking skills. The most important finding in this study was understanding the interdependence of systems, which is the most basic feature of ST.

T1  - Knowledge capture and its representation using concept map in bioinspired design
AN  - 2879185285
AB  - Biological knowledge can be represented using different models textually and diagrammatically. One of the least explored diagrammatic methods for biological knowledge representation is concept map. In this paper, we present the growth in publications for concept map from 1974 to 2021 and attempt to capture the knowledge of phenomenon exhibited by the biological entity and represent its knowledge by information extraction for the use of designers in the bioinspired design process. A preliminary investigation has also been done to determine whether a causal mechanism can be found in the concept map. If yes, whether it is easy to abstract knowledge in a concept map or not. We also present the generic methodology to develop a concept map for any biological text with an example. To develop the concept map, biological knowledge is deconstructed from the text. Comparative text content analysis in biological text and concept has been done to know about redundancy. We then developed a completed concept map and assessed whether the participant understands the biological information without any intervention. The overall aim is to know whether knowledge can be captured and represented using concept maps for bioinspired design. This research aims to provide designers with a methodology to develop their own concept maps for biological entities. The overall goal is to foster meaningful learning and support bioinspired product design.

T1  - High school students' perceptions and experiences of using combined RW and labatorials to understand Newton's laws of motion: Journal Canadien de Physique
AN  - 2870690082
AB  - We discuss the perceptions and experiences of high school students using reflective writing and labatorials to attempt to understand Newtonian concepts of force and motion. The sequencing and content of these activities are centered on targeting students’ key difficulties related to forces and motion. Participants are 210 secondary 5 (grade 11) students, from three private schools in Montreal, who took a physics course during 2017–2018 or 2018–2019. Their ideas and opinions about forces and learning physics were investigated prior to and following the study with (a) three questions from the Force Concept Inventory; (b) a concept map focused on the relations between force and motion, and (c) pre- and post-semi-structured interviews conducted with 12 participants. The gathered data and interviews indicate that the process of combining labatorials with reflective writing improves students’ attitudes towards learning the subject.

T1  - Understanding the Autonomic Nervous System: A How-To Guide for Designing Engaging Pathophysiology and Pharmacology Courses for Nursing Students
AN  - 2867838598
AB  - Aim. The objective of this article is to describe our innovative competency-based approach to teaching nursing students about the autonomic nervous system (ANS). Background. Nurse educators require resources about pedagogical approaches related to ANS instruction. Design and Methods. We implemented an approach based on Kolb’s Experiential Learning Theory, which was piloted in several nursing courses that spanned undergraduate and graduate levels of education. Results. We organized content according to three core ANS concepts: receptors and ligands; neurotransmission; and ANS divisions and reflexes. After students demonstrated mastery of these concepts, we introduced active-learning exercises, such as case studies, interactive games, concept mapping, and simulation-based education. This approach layered clinically-relevant information upon the core concepts. We leveraged student feedback by adding historical, social science, and literary examples into lectures because students reported how this approach made the material engaging. Conclusion. Our approach guides students toward a conceptual understanding of the ANS to support critical thinking and enhance nursing skills, such as interpreting physiologic signals, titrating vasoactive medications, and recognizing ANS disorders.

T1  - Scientific language use and sensemaking in concept maps: Interaction between concept systems, scientific concepts and everyday concepts
AN  - 2849845240
AB  - The interaction between student language use and sensemaking is an area in science learning that needs further elucidation in order to meet government standards in science education. In this study, concept mapping was used to explore the relationship between scientific language use and sensemaking defined as the interaction between the scientific concept system and everyday concepts in order to make sense of a proposed phenomenon. Eighty-eight concept maps from five different school classes and two school systems were analyzed in terms of their language use and concept formation from a Vygotskian perspective. This work proposes an intimate relationship between student language use, concept system formation and sensemaking in science, indicating possible implications for the study of learning as well as formative assessment using concept maps.

T1  - A scoping review comparing different mapping approaches pointing to the need for standardizing concept maps in medical education: A preliminary analysis
AN  - 2849845028
AB  - This study aims to analyze how visual tools, labeled as maps, are built, and used in medical education. Based on the educational model of concept maps (CMs), proposed by Novak and Cañas (2008), and adapted to medicine by Daley and Torre (2010), we are currently analyzing the results of a scoping review following the PRISMA extension methodology, specifically for these purposes. Other visual tools, such as knowledge maps (KMs) and mind maps (MMs), used in medical education, were also included. The search was made through the databases EBSCO, PubMed/MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Eric, using the following items: “concept map*”, “knowledge map*”, “mind map*” and “medical education”. Only articles in English were considered and exclusively in medical education, from undergraduate to resident training. The analysis of selected articles included the following features: construction rules (if they followed Novakian instructions), teaching area, student level (undergraduate, postgraduate/residents), and use for assessment. Other features were the capacity to relate basic science knowledge to clinical concepts, the use of maps with other educational methods, such as problem-based learning (PBL), and providing feedback to students. From a quantitative perspective, the use of CMs is dominant in all phases of medical education. A failure to follow Novakian rules was found in around half of the articles labeled as CMs and KMs. As for MMs, which follow different rules for construction and use, they were considered relevant in helping students to summarize and retain information. Simultaneous use with other educational methods was only found with CMs.

T1  - Improving learning and understanding through concept mapping
AN  - 2849844918
AB  - It is widely accepted that concept maps are a meaningful learning tool. Even so, the use of concept mapping as a meaningful learning tool is probably less common than the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool. In first place, the easiest thing to with a student’s concept map is to apply a rubric and give it a grade. And second, teachers often believe that by using a meaningful learning tool, their students are learning meaningfully while constructing their concept maps. We are then missing on the greatest power of the concept map, its use as a tool to learn meaningfully. In this paper we examine the difference between using concept maps for learning and for assessment, and propose steps on how to move towards the use of the tool to improve students’ learning and understanding.

However, this aspect is difficult to implement in reality, as teachers work with a large number of students and the whole process of formative assessment, especially the evaluation of student performance takes a lot of time. To address this problem, this paper presents an approach in which student performance is collected through a concept map and quickly evaluated using Machine Learning techniques. For this purpose, a concept map on the topic of mechanics was developed and used in 14 physics classes in Germany. After the student maps were analysed by two human raters on the basis of a four-level feedback scheme, a supervised Machine Learning algorithm was trained on the data. The results show a very good agreement between the human and Machine Learning evaluation. Based on these results, an embedding in everyday school life is conceivable, especially as support for teachers. In this way, the teacher can use and interpret the automatic evaluation and use it in the classroom.

T1  - Using concept maps to surf semantic waves in the pursuit of powerful knowledge structures
AN  - 2849844583
AB  - The evolution of concept mapping has benefitted from the robust theoretical basis provided by Ausubelian learning theory. However, for concept mapping to maintain its relevance and to keep pace with the evolutionary changes in the educational context, it is vital that educational researchers and classroom practitioners can augment this theoretical base with contemporary learning theories that will help to improve the application of concept mapping and increase the likelihood that the goal of meaningful learning will be achieved in practice. This involves shifting the focus of concept mapping from product to process and the role of the learner from ‘being’ to ‘becoming.’ The act of concept mapping needs to be viewed as a way of mastering learning rather than of mastering specific content. We propose the consideration of the explicit role of semantic waves as an improvement from simplistic knowledge representation towards the development of more complex knowledge modelling as a way of developing powerful knowledge structures.

AN  - 2847958838
AB  - Conference Title: 2023 2nd International Conference on Advancements in Electrical, Electronics, Communication, Computing and Automation (ICAECA)Conference Start Date:  2023,  June  16 Conference End Date:  2023,  June  17 Conference Location: Coimbatore, IndiaThe information available today is scattered everywhere. The traditional method of learning which is completely text-based takes more time to understand. Students must learn more in less time and also have good knowledge of the concepts which are not only present in the textbooks, but also from external sources. Visual learning techniques are the most well-known effective way to learn more information in less time. When information is presented visually, it is easy to understand the concepts and remember them for a long time. The knowledge graph is used to represent the information with the relationship between the different topics in a visually comprehensive manner. Our project aims in helping students to learn visually with the help of knowledge graphs (or concept maps). The Graphs for various subjects will be available separately and can be used by students to learn interactively. Our project is mainly focused on subjects from the computer science domain. For the knowledge graph construction, the required data is scraped from the internet using Wikipedia and Google Knowledge APIs. Natural language processing (NLP) is used to process scrapped data from the internet which is then processed using a graph database to display the knowledge graph with the data and the relationship connecting the data. All graphs are made in such a way to make a visual impact on learners such that it is easy to read and interpret.

T1  - Development of Systems and Futures Thinking Skills by Primary Pre-service Teachers for Addressing Epidemics
AN  - 2836406534
AB  - Abstract Science educators highlight the importance of developing systems thinking (ST) and futures thinking (FT) for students to make decisions and to be active citizens that address socioscientific problems. The dimensions related to FT take in this study were three implied in ST and two in the appropriation of the future. The aim of this study is to analyse the level of FT-related dimensions developed by a group of pre-service elementary teachers and how far different activities designed to foster them were effective. Written explanations presented by the participants about the origin of pandemics and possible ways to prevent them, as well as videos developed by small groups with the goal to present a campaign for avoiding future pandemics, were analysed. Based on the literature, five dimensions and up to four levels of performances were identified. After completing the activities, participants were able to relate the three spheres of the “One Health” notion to explain the causes of pandemics. Moreover, they established complex cause-effect relationships between the different factors, although they only constructed monocausal relationships when proposing measures. Participants improved their performance in anticipating the future and identifying themselves as agents of change. The elaboration of concept maps facilitated the development of components and behaviour ST dimensions, and the design of the campaign allowed participants to identify themselves as agents of change. The use of these strategies in science education can contribute to the development of a citizenry capable of understanding and acting on systems.

T1  - The concept map as a substitute for lectures: Effects on student performance and mental health
AN  - 2832903172
AB  - In comparison with traditional lectures, active learning methods have the potential to foster learner agency and consequently raise academic performance. However, these methods are often applied with little knowledge about their effectiveness. In this study, we introduced two concept maps in an undergraduate cell biology course, to investigate their effect on student performance, but also mental health, in a quasi-experimental setup. By implementing group tasks into the work, we aimed to reduce feelings of loneliness among the participants, a common phenomenon among students in the study country. We evaluated the effects of the concept maps via exam grades and in an anonymous student survey. Here, we found no increase in student performance after introduction of the active learning task. Students also did not report improvements in their feelings of loneliness. We conclude that this active learning method did not detectably improve student performance or mental health, a result which does not conform to the popular perception of positive effects from active learning. The survey revealed that students do not have a preference for either active learning or traditional lectures, however, the students experienced that the concept map helped them to describe, explain and hypothesize about the topics. Overall, this shows that the concept map method is a valid alternative to traditional lectures, since students perform equally between both learning approaches.

T1  - Designing a Leveled Conversational Teachable Agent for English Language Learners
AN  - 2823983423
AB  - Given the considerable importance of the English language as a common method of global communication, supporting and engaging learning environments for studying English as a second language are essential. In this study, we propose an interactive agent that considers differences in learners’ skill levels to help motivate learners and support independent study. The proposed agent is an AI chatbot that can vary the complexity of its natural language interactions as learners’ skills improve and engage in unstructured conversations with users. We first collected a dataset of English conversations among children and then acquired data on learners’ utterances of words and sentences using an interactive interface for skill evaluation. Based on these datasets, we generated a set of personalized conversational agents by using algorithms to evaluate speakers’ pronunciation and sentences. Finally, an expert in English language learning evaluated the interactive system to ensure that it could support learners with different levels of proficiency and that the application may be expected to help motivate students to learn. The results showed that the interactive teachable agent could help motivate students who may not otherwise be interested in learning by using a more personalized approach tailored to their skill level.

T1  - Bibliometric Analysis of Automated Assessment in Programming Education: A Deeper Insight into Feedback
AN  - 2819443326
AB  - Learning to program requires diligent practice and creates room for discovery, trial and error, debugging, and concept mapping. Learners must walk this long road themselves, supported by appropriate and timely feedback. Providing such feedback in programming exercises is not a humanly feasible task. Therefore, the early and steadily growing interest of computer science educators in the automated assessment of programming exercises is not surprising. The automated assessment of programming assignments has been an active area of research for over a century, and interest in it continues to grow as it adapts to new developments in computer science and the resulting changes in educational requirements. It is therefore of paramount importance to understand the work that has been performed, who has performed it, its evolution over time, the relationships between publications, its hot topics, and open problems, among others. This paper presents a bibliometric study of the field, with a particular focus on the issue of automatic feedback generation, using literature data from the Web of Science Core Collection. It includes a descriptive analysis using various bibliometric measures and data visualizations on authors, affiliations, citations, and topics. In addition, we performed a complementary analysis focusing only on the subset of publications on the specific topic of automatic feedback generation. The results are highlighted and discussed.

T1  - Learning with Interactive Knowledge Representations
AN  - 2812408086
AB  - Computers are promising tools for providing educational experiences that meet individual learning needs. However, delivering this promise in practice is challenging, particularly when automated feedback is essential and the learning extends beyond using traditional methods such as writing and solving mathematics problems. We hypothesize that interactive knowledge representations can be deployed to address this challenge. Knowledge representations differ markedly from concept maps. Where the latter uses nodes (concepts) and arcs (links between concepts), a knowledge representation is based on an ontology that facilitates automated reasoning. By adjusting this reasoning towards interacting with learners for the benefit of learning, a new class of educational instruments emerges. In this contribution, we present three projects that use an interactive knowledge representation as their foundation. DynaLearn supports learners in acquiring system thinking skills. Minds-On helps learners to deepen their understanding of phenomena while performing experiments. Interactive Concept Cartoons engage learners in a science-based discussion about controversial topics. Each of these approaches has been developed iteratively in collaboration with teachers and tested in real classrooms, resulting in a suite of lessons available online. Evaluation studies involving pre-/post-tests and action-log data show that learners are easily capable of working with these educational instruments and that the instruments thus enable a semi-automated approach to constructive learning.

T1  - Exploring Pre-service Science Teachers’ Understanding of Scientific Inquiry and Scientific Practices Through a Laboratory Course
AN  - 2810187973
AB  - The intervention study presented in this paper explored pre-service science teachers’ (PSSTs) understanding of scientific inquiry (SI) and scientific practices (SPs) during a laboratory application in science education course. Thirty-nine secondary school PSSTs, who study in the Science Education Department in a public university in Turkey, enrolled in a 14-week-long course and volunteered to participate in the study. The participants were exposed to a method is called the 4-phase implementation that includes laboratory-based inquiry activities addressing SI and SPs and they completed microteaching presentations. Their understanding of SI and SPs was examined through the course period. The main data sources included Views about Scientific Inquiry (VASI) Instrument and concept maps were used to track the changes in these understandings. The findings indicated that PSSTs had inadequate understanding of inquiry on some aspects even after the treatment. Yet, the method had positive impact in PSSTs’ understanding inquiry especially in terms of facilitating the comprehension that scientific investigations begin with questions, there is no single method in investigations, and explanations are derived from collected data. The concept maps created by some of the participants also supported these results and revealed a more coherent and holistic understanding of SPs by integrating both epistemic and social components into their maps. However, PSSTs did not seem to have totally understood other aspects of inquiry including the inquiry procedures, the research conclusions, and the difference between data and evidence. Further implications are critically discussed in terms of designing future laboratory applications for science education courses.

T1  - Functional Analysis Diagrams in Science and Technology Education
AN  - 2791603240
AB  - With the world currently facing an escalating environmental crisis and major virus disease outbreaks, the need to significantly grow the STEM workforce ranks has never been more urgent. The authors propose a novel teaching methodology involving functional analysis diagrams (FADs) as an educational aid. The paper presents a method to quantitatively assess the effects of the proposed intervention in an educational setting alongside a pilot study conducted in a South Korean secondary school with non-native English-speaking students (n = 39). The written assessment results indicate that the FAD-assisted method can have a measurable effect and have the potential to assist students with lower scores in English. This pilot study’s results suggest that FAD models of engineering systems can enhance knowledge transfers in technology and engineering education. Experimental validation using the proposed method was shown to be feasible and would require a moderate-sized sample (n ≥ 168) for a future full-scale study.

T1  - Effect of self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback on chemistry learning outcome
AN  - 2785244717
AB  - Concept mapping remains widely used in education. However, little is known about how self‐constructed concept maps and peer feedback can improve student learning outcomes in chemistry. We investigated the effects of peer feedback on concept mapping and how it improves students' learning performance in a large second‐semester, introductory chemistry course. Three hundred and twenty students were randomly assigned to one of two concept mapping conditions: self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback and self‐constructed concept map without peer feedback. Each group constructed concept maps that depicted the relationship between concepts on the topic of intermolecular force. The results showed that students in the self‐constructed concept map with peer feedback condition outperformed students in the no peer feedback condition in chemistry learning outcome. Overall, this study demonstrates that peer feedback enhances the effectiveness of learning with generative concept maps. The implications and future directions are discussed.

T1  - Community-Centered Sustainable Ecotourism Planning in the Bossou Forest Reserve, Guinea, West Africa
AN  - 2785243602
AB  - Forest reserves are spaces of conservation and are often spaces of ecotourism as well. Evidence suggests that local community participation in the conservation of the forest reserve space tends to break down under weak ecotourism sector management. The Bossou Forest Reserve (BFR) in Guinea, West Africa has deteriorated considerably due to the fragmentation of the reserve and the inexorable decline in Bossou chimpanzee populations since the 1970s. The situation is largely attributable to several complex and interrelated factors, including the lack of established processes to support meaningful community participation in conservation and ecotourism planning. Ecotourism planning, with the participation of local communities, is considered to strengthen the management of the BFR and conservation connectivity. This paper reports on an approach to sustainable ecotourism planning of the BFR using the Limits of Acceptable Change (LAC) framework to determine the drivers of change and livelihood concerns. Fieldwork undertook in 2019 entailed concept mapping activities which were followed by a participatory geographic information system (PGIS) approach to support community-scale ecotourism planning that considers the multiple needs of stakeholders. Data analysis resulted in a community-centered situational assessment and classification of opportunities, both of which inform ecotourism planning and social-ecological resilience. The study provides baseline data for developing a robust ecotourism management plan capable of coping with the changing internal and external stressors. PGIS-based ecotourism planning can support community priorities and is potentially applicable to other West African areas with similar ecological and livelihood settings.

T1  - Defining the Connotations of Oral Health Literacy Using the Conceptual Composition Method
AN  - 2779567667
AB  - Due to advancements in research, the concept of oral health literacy (OHL) has become rich in connotations, with over 250 definitions present in the literature and government and organizational reports. The diversity of OHL definitions and connotations not only produces conflicting results but also limits the production of accurate OHL measurement and assessment tools while simultaneously hindering the construction of health literacy intervention policies. To clarify the connotations of OHL and establish a scientific basis for evaluation, we conducted a systematic review, searching and analyzing the literature related to the conceptual connotations of OHL. Additionally, we extracted basic, methodological, and OHL conceptual connotation information from the literature. With reference to the review framework, we classified the conceptual connotations of OHL into antecedents of OHL, the core of OHL, mediators, and outcomes of OHL. The comprehensive conceptual connotations of OHL were obtained through a systematic review and concept mapping based on the related literature. Our analysis revealed that the antecedents of OHL can be classified in two categories: personal factors and external factors. The core conceptual connotations of OHL include three core dimensions (with 16 subdimensions): (1) basic skills—literacy, reading comprehension, numeracy, hearing, oral expression, communication, and knowledge; (2) information-related abilities—information acquisition, information understanding, information communication, information evaluation, information utilization, and information decision-making; and (3) oral health maintenance abilities—interpersonal skills, self-regulation, and goal achievement. The mediator of these connotations is oral health behaviors, with oral health being the result of OHL. This study further clarifies the conceptual connotations of OHL, serving as a reference for future OHL-related studies.

T1  - Teach different: The CREATE pedagogy for ecology and evolution
AN  - 2770579423
AB  - Globally, teaching has changed and innovated profoundly in the last 3 years. With novel and more seamless opportunities to use technology and more actively teach visually online or in-person and to engage in inclusive dialogue within and between groups, we can teach very differently now. An innovation proposed a number of years ago and revisited anew in a recent and novel application to ecology and evolution course offerings, and the CREATE pedagogy or Consider, Read, Elucidate the hypothesis or purpose, Analyze and interpret data or evidence, and Think of the next Experiment is an inspiring framework for unique student work and teaching. CREATE proposes that students engage in active reading through specific exercises that are both creative and heavily anchored in critical thinking when working with publications. Here, the palette of CREATE exercises is expanded further for ecology and evolution and affirms that this approach to student engagement with literature can be highly effective in many courses. Furthermore, the application of this pedagogy dramatically influences and likely enhances how one teaches in a lecture setting as an educator making the content in all modalities more engaging and active.

T1  - The Concept of Ocean Sustainability in High School: Measuring the Ocean Literacy of Vocational High School Students in Indonesia
AN  - 2767296949
AB  - In this study, we used propositional concept maps with different ocean-related conceptual sentences to assess the ocean literacy of maritime vocational high school students in Grades 10–12 in Indonesia. Indonesia is the world’s largest archipelagic country, and many aspects of people’s lives, including their jobs, are related to the ocean. Therefore, it is crucial to assess the ocean literacy and related knowledge of students, especially maritime vocational high school students. Thus, in this study, an open-ended questionnaire was employed to acquire data from 255 students at the National Vocational High School 1 Temon in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. A total of 215 males and 40 females participated in this study. In addition to descriptive analysis, we used a one-way analysis of variance and a t-test for statistical inference. The results showed that 11th and 12th graders scored significantly higher in ocean literacy than 10th graders, and female students significantly outperformed male students. Furthermore, student learning was teacher-centered. In this paper, we summarize the results and provide suggestions and references concerning ocean literacy for teachers and high school students.

AN  - 2753529237
AB  - This study examined the effects of concept maps on Senior School students’ achievement in ecology in Ogbomoso, Nigeria. Quasi-experimental design was employed. The population for the study was all SSII Biology students in Ogbomoso South. Four intact classes of 267 students (115 males and 152 females) were sampled. The instrument was Biology Achievement Test. The data were analyzed using t-test, and analysis of covariance findings of the study showed that significant difference exited in the achievement of students taught ecological concepts in biology. It was recommended that biology students should be exposed to concept maps in the learning of biology.

T1  - Supporting reflection to improve learning from self-generated concept maps
AN  - 2741133938
AB  - Creating concept maps is considered to be a powerful means for learning. It requires students to systematically organize and integrate their knowledge, which can foster meaningful learning. However, students scarcely spontaneously engage in the (meta)cognitive processes necessary for effective knowledge integration, such as reflection, which can hamper the effectiveness of concept mapping for learning. This study explores the effect of additional support that stimulates reflection by means of expert examples, reflection prompts, and classroom discussion. First-year technical vocational students (N = 144, Mage = 17.5 years) studied electricity-related topics in an online learning environment and created concept maps about their knowledge. Students’ concept maps were supplemented with either (1) no support (control condition), (2) an expert example (a combined concept map, containing their own and an expert example concept map, with differences highlighted), (3) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually, (4) an expert example and reflection prompts students had to process individually after a teacher-guided classroom discussion. Students in the classroom discussion condition showed higher learning gains compared to all other conditions. This can be explained by the quality of their reflection, which proved to be a significant predictor of learning gain.

T1  - Differential Analysis of the Years of Experience of Higher Education Teachers, their Digital Competence and use of Digital Resources: Comparative Research Methods
AN  - 2737959212
AB  - This study compares the level of digital competence of Spanish higher education teachers in the use of three types of ICT resources in the classroom: digital tools to consume information, digital tools to produce information, and emerging technologies. To measure the level of competence, the validated DigCompEdu Check-In instrument with an ex post facto design is used. The sample consists of 2180 university teachers from Andalusia (Spain) working in different areas of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Sciences, Health Sciences, Engineering and Architecture, Social and Legal Sciences; and classified into three levels of teaching experience: between 0–5 years, 6–14 years, and 15 years or more. The results show that teachers with 15 or more years of experience represent the group with the most significant differences in regard to their level of digital competence when comparing the use of the three types of ICT resources; furthermore, the results were similar for all areas of knowledge. In addition, the visualization or creation of videos, as well as the visualization or creation of posters and concept maps, are the resources that were found to be most significant for the three levels of experience. For each specific area, it is recommended that each of their results is analysed in detail. Finally, further research is recommended to validate these preliminary findings in each of the knowledge areas.

T1  - Expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps by students to promote perceived self-efficacy in learning science
AN  - 2712354540
AB  - BackgroundThe goal of this research was to determine students’ perceived self-efficacy in science classes through involving students in expanding disciplinary core idea (DCI) and interdisciplinary core idea (ICI) maps, as a method to visualize knowledge (utilizing mind mapping and concept mapping) to support students to integrate interdisciplinary learning. The research involved (a) creating (by science educators) eight curriculum-related, disciplinary core idea maps and two interdisciplinary core idea maps; (b) teachers guiding students in an experimental group, to make interdisciplinary connections so as to expand DCI and ICI maps in an intervention lasting a year and a half from grade 10 to 11; (c) providing feedback on students’ developed DCI and ICI maps; (d) administering questionnaires seeking students’ perceptions about their self-efficacy towards core ideas, both before and after the intervention and (e) interviewing science teachers (5) and selected students (25), after the intervention, about their perceptions towards the use and outcomes of their DCI and ICI maps. Besides the experimental group, a control group (no intervention) was involved.ResultsOutcomes showed that the intervention (guiding students in creating disciplinary and interdisciplinary core idea maps to visualize their learning) supported students significantly in their perceived self-efficacy in the fields of Life Science and Earth Science, plus in the use of Models and Systems. In Physics and Chemistry, the students’ perceived self-efficacy was not statistically significantly positive after the conducted intervention. This stemmed from disciplinary core ideas, related to Physics and Chemistry, being more abstract, with students making fewer connections and integrating less new knowledge into the related DCI and ICI maps. In the interviews, both teachers and students stated that the intervention (including expansion of DCI and ICI maps) supported students’ science learning.ConclusionsCreating and expanding disciplinary and interdisciplinary core ideas more clearly indicates students’ learning, through their ability to make meaningful connections, enabling students to raise their self-efficacy in preparing for their future. The results from this research demonstrate that students’ perceived self-efficacy can occur through knowledge visualization by expanding both DCI and ICI maps enabling the making of greater interdisciplinary connections.

T1  - Deliberate errors promote meaningful learning
AN  - 2735923538
AB  - Our civilization recognizes that errors can be valuable learning opportunities, but for decades, they have widely been avoided or, at best, allowed to occur as serendipitous accidents. The present research tested whether greater learning success could paradoxically be achieved through making errors by intentional design, relative to traditional errorless learning methods. We show that deliberately committing and correcting errors even when one knows the correct answers enhances learning-a counterintuitive phenomenon that we termed the derring effect. Across two experiments (N = 160), learners engaged in open-book study of scientific expository texts and were then tested on their retention and higher-order application of the material to analyze a novel news event. Deliberate error commission and correction during study produced not only better recall performance, but also superior knowledge application compared to two errorless study techniques that are popular among students and educational researchers: copying with underlining, and elaborative studying with concept mapping (Experiment 1). These learning benefits persisted even over generating alternative conceptually correct answers, revealing that the derring effect is not merely attributable to generation or elaboration alone, but is unique to producing incorrect responses (Experiment 2). Yet, learners were largely unaware of these advantages even after experiencing them. Our results suggest that avoiding errors in learning may not always be most optimal. Rather, deliberate erring is a powerful strategy to enhance meaningful learning. We discuss implications for educational practice in redesigning conventional approaches to errors: To err is human; to deliberately err is divine.

T1  - Giving feedback on peers’ concept maps as a learning experience: does quality of reviewed concept maps matter?
AN  - 2716775715
AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a powerful learning tool because of the feedback provider’s active cognitive involvement with the products to be reviewed. The quality of peers’ products is naturally an important factor that might influence not only the quality of the feedback that is given, but also the learning arising from this process. This experimental study investigated the effect of the level of quality of the reviewed product on the knowledge acquisition of feedback providers, as well as the role of prior knowledge in this. Dutch secondary-school students (n = 77) were assigned to one of three conditions, which varied in the quality of the learning products (concept maps) on which students had to give feedback while working in an online physics inquiry learning environment. Post-test knowledge scores, the quality of students’ own concept maps and the quality of the feedback given were analyzed to determine any effect of condition on the learning of feedback providers. Students providing feedback on the lower-quality concept maps gave better feedback and had higher post-test scores. There was no interaction with level of prior knowledge. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed.

T1  - Understanding Complex Ecosystems Through an Agent-Based Participatory Watershed Simulation
AN  - 2708875287
AB  - The properties and functions of complex systems apply across a variety of domains of science and are at the heart of the solutions to many global crises facing the world today. As such, understanding of complex systems has been increasingly recognized as a core goal of science education. Learning about complexity-related concepts and phenomena is persistently considered difficult for many students—even at the undergraduate level, but traditional pedagogical approaches have been unsuccessful in teaching complex systems effectively. Evidence indicates that agent-based participatory simulations can be promising for this purpose. Using mixed methods, cross-case analysis, we examined how undergraduates experience changes in their understanding of the watershed as a complex ecosystem with the use of a particular agent-based participatory simulation called the UVA Bay Game. While one of the cases yielded evidence of nonsignificant quantitative change between pre- and post-simulation concept maps, this study observed an overall positive increase of complex system understanding through both concept map analysis and narrative reflections on learning. Our findings extend the current understanding of the role of participatory agent-based simulations in teaching and learning about complex systems in classrooms. Implications and limitations are discussed.

T1  - Effect of Digital Learning Using Augmented Reality with Multidimensional Concept Map in Elementary Science Course
AN  - 2890044837
AB  - This study explores whether learning approaches combining augmented reality and multidimensional concept maps (ARMCMs) would improve learning effectiveness, learning motivation, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load more than multidimensional concept maps (MCMs) and augmented reality (AR) learning do. The study employed a quasi-experimental design, and the subjects were 93 students from an elementary school in Taiwan. By dividing the students into ARMCMs group, MCMs group, and AR group, the results show that the learning with ARMCMs can provide better promotion on learning motivation and positive influences on learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction, and cognitive load.

T1  - A concept mapping-based prediction-observation-explanation approach to promoting students’ flipped learning achievements and perceptions
AN  - 2714789828
AB  - Previous research has illustrated the potential of flipped learning for assisting teachers in designing meaningful activities to promote students’ higher order thinking skills; however, several previous studies have challenged the effects of flipped learning on students’ learning. One of the key problems is the lack of an effective learning approach or tools to engage students in the flipped learning activity. In this study, a concept mapping-based Prediction-Observation-Explanation (POE) approach was incorporated into flipped learning (called CPOE-FL) to enhance students’ scientific learning. Furthermore, a three-group experiment was conducted to assess the effects of the three flipped learning models, comprising the CPOE-FL approach, the POE-FL (incorporating POE into flipped learning) approach, and the C-FL (conventional flipped learning) approach. The experimental results displayed that the CPOE-FL approach can benefit the learning achievements and self-efficacy of the students with respectively lower prior knowledge and lower initial self-efficacy, in comparison with the POE-FL and C-FL approaches. Both the CPOE-FL and POE-FL approaches promoted the students’ inner learning motivation, while the CPOE-FL approach enhanced the students’ critical thinking. This proposed approach could provide a good reference for researchers or school teachers intending to implement POE-based flipped learning in the future.

T1  - Effectiveness of the use of concept maps and simulated cases as a teaching-learning strategy in enhancing the learning confidence of baccalaureate nursing students: A qualitative approach
AN  - 2709763799
AB  - Background: Didactic lectures and exam-oriented learning can lead to students becoming passive learners who rely on rote memory. This learning style negatively impacts their ability to cultivate the core nursing values and critical thinking. Objectives: This study aimed to investigate the impact of a concept mapping teaching-learning strategy on undergraduate nursing students' ability to integrate theoretical biosciences knowledge into care practice and on their skills in critical thinking and teamwork. Methods: A qualitative research design was adopted. A course entitled Evaluation and Analysis of Adult Nursing Cases was developed based on a concept mapping strategy involving 24 simulated cases relevant to medical and surgical nursing. The participants were students from the two-year undergraduate nursing programme at a university in Taiwan. Data were collected from September 2020 to February 2021. Qualitative data were collected from semi-structured face-to-face interviews with 20 students and from 100 reflective reports on students' learning journeys. The data were analysed using qualitative content analysis. Results: Two major themes were identified: (1) changes in learning style and thinking and (2) rewards from learning. The participants reported that their learning style had changed from reliance on rote learning to image memory, and their thinking process from linear (cause-effect) to multifaceted thinking at different levels. The teaching and learning strategies contributed to feelings of ability advancement and psychological safety, which led to learning achievement and confidence. Conclusion: The use of a concept mapping strategy and simulated cases enhanced students' learning by enabling them to integrate theoretical knowledge and improve their thinking abilities. The teaching and learning strategies helped participants in learning about psychological safety and increased their learning confidence.

T1  - Integrating inquiry based learning in physics teacher education through a seminar about processes of gaining knowledge in science
AN  - 2695022607
AB  - Internalizing the process and methods of scientific research is fundamental both for young people who are getting prepared to work as scientific researchers, as well as for those who participate in social discourses on scientific issues as responsible citizens. In addition, many current problems can not only be solved from a specialist perspective; interdisciplinary cooperation plays an important role in research and society. It is therefore important that teachers know teaching concepts that enable students to acquire competencies to be prepared for these challenges in life. To implement this, a new pre-service teacher study curriculum was developed as part of the MINTplus2 (engl. STEMplus2) project at TU Darmstadt, which conveys interdisciplinary teaching approaches, especially about STEM. As a part of this project, we developed a new seminar which focusses especially on didactic concepts like inquiry-based learning in order to prepare pre-service science teachers to convey their students the methodological knowledge of the scientific research process. This paper shows the seminar structure embedded in the whole project and the first evaluation results with n=14 concept maps of seven students that show that there is a measurable increase in knowledge regarding the seminar topic.

T1  - Developmental Considerations in a Problematic Ecology: Achieving Equity and Socially Just Learning Environments for African American Adolescents With Emotional and Behavioral Challenges
AN  - 2673084614
AB  - This article critically discusses the ecology of public schools in the United States: systemic barriers and associated biases that permeate these learning contexts and derail efforts to close opportunity gaps for African American adolescents with emotional and behavioral challenges. Using results from a mixed-methods study, we illustrate the ubiquity of an a-developmental perspective that guides perceptions of what is needed to keep these students in and successful at school. A close examination of school mental health providers’ perceptions of what is important and feasible in public school contexts shows recommended interventions to be necessary but not sufficient. We highlight important considerations in the reframing of schools as a dynamic developmental system and conclude with recommendations about how to harness adolescents’ strengths to generate strategies that move us toward more equitable and socially just schooling.

T1  - Lessons Learned From the Glaserian Grounded Theory Approach: Professionalizing as a Basic Social Process in Elite Athletes’ Lifestyle
AN  - 2758346542
AB  - This paper presents a qualitative study conducted using the Glaserian grounded theory (GT) method. Glaser’s approach to GT differs from Strauss and Corbin’s method, which is more widespread. There are some differences in the focus on participants’ concerns, staying in the research environment for an extended period to discover participants’ main concerns and the emergence of a basic social process around the core category. The Glaserian GT method was used to understand elite athletes’ lifestyles. Two groups of athletes and non-athletes were recruited for the interview as the sample. The core category was determined through iterative coding, memoing, theoretical sampling, and theoretical sorting. There were overlaps in these phases; they fluctuated back and forth and were not as clear-cut as they could be. Results showed the lifestyle components of elite athletes. Besides identifying participants’ main concerns, the results also demonstrated how to address them over time. It is a category of a basic social process named “professionalizing.” Lastly, the steps of creating a concept map are explained practically, which in addition to sports science scholars, can be considered by researchers in other fields.

T1  - The Pittsburgh Study: Learning with Communities About Child Health and Thriving
AN  - 2660785974
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted structural inequities that are barriers to thriving for children in neighborhoods with concentrated disadvantage. Health systems are increasingly addressing health-related social needs. The “Pittsburgh Study” is a longitudinal, community-partnered study focused on child and adolescent thriving and racial equity. This initiative will elucidate critical influences on childhood health and thriving, evaluate developmentally appropriate interventions to improve outcomes from birth to high school, and establish a child health data hub. Integration of community members into scientific inquiry, rapid data-to-action cycles, and workforce development are strategies health systems may consider to enhance child health equity.

T1  - An integrated concept mapping and image recognition approach to improving students' scientific inquiry course performance
AN  - 2647943947
AB  - Scholars and researchers generally believe that scientific inquiry is an important activity for cultivating students' applied knowledge and high‐level thinking ability. The process of scientific inquiry can promote students' learning motivation and trigger their higher‐order thinking ability. However, students may not have enough prior knowledge or they may lack inquiry experience, which may influence the effectiveness of their inquiry learning. Besides, in a scientific inquiry environment assisted by technology, students must face abundant and diverse learning resources, and may not effectively organize and carry out advanced cogitation to solve problems. Therefore, this research proposed an integrated concept mapping and image recognition (IR) approach to help students effectively acquire and organize knowledge in the process of scientific inquiry. This study applied a quasi‐experimental design to verify the effect of this proposed approach. The experimental group conducted the concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach, whilst the control group conducted the conventional IR‐based learning approach to evaluate the students' performance in terms of their learning motivation and learning achievements. The participants were two classes of 10th‐grade students in northern Taiwan. One was the experimental group with 22 students, whilst the other was the control group with 22 students. The experimental results show that the students learning with the CM‐IR learning approach had better learning achievement, attitudes and intrinsic motivation, as well as higher mental load than those learning with the conventional IR‐based learning approach. Accordingly, several suggestions are provided for future research in this field.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicWith the development of information technology, AI has attracted the attention of researchers.Image recognition (IR) is one of the AI applications, and has been used to support learning in various educational fields.Researchers have indicated that concept mapping is an effective instructional strategy and promotes students' knowledge construction.What this paper addsA concept mapping‐based IR (CM‐IR) learning approach is proposed to improve students' scientific inquiry performance.A quasi‐experimental design was conducted with 10th‐grade students on the ‘Plant identification’ unit of the scientific inquiry course.The experimental results show that the proposed approach can significantly improve students' learning achievement, learning motivation and learning attitude.Implications for practice and/or policyThe CM‐IR learning approach could be an effective method to facilitate students' learning performances and motivation in scientific inquiry.It is worth promoting the CM‐IR learning approach in school settings since it is low‐cost and enables learning anywhere using mobile devices.Scholars and educators are encouraged to work on how AI technologies applications can be applied to support learning.

T1  - Effects of Concept Mapping and Guided Discovery Instructional Strategies on Students’ Achievement in Redox Concept of Chemistry in Oyo State, Nigeria
AN  - 2798556511
AB  - The study determined the effects of concept mapping and guided discovery instructional strategies on student’s learning achievement in Redox concept in Chemistry in Oyo State, Nigeria. The pretest-posttest control group quasi experimental design with 3x2 factorial matrix was adopted, while six schools with one intact class each; two each for experimental groups and two for control group were used. A total of 176 senior secondary school 2 Chemistry students participated in the study. A validated Chemistry Student Achievement Test (r = 0.77) was used for data collection, while Analysis of covariance and Bonferroni post hoc were used to analyze the data collected at 0.05 level of significance. There was a significant main effect of treatment (F(2, 175) =11.84; p<0.05, partial η2 = 0.13) on student’s achievement. The participants in concept mapping strategy obtained the highest post achievement mean score (12.71), followed by guided discovery instructional strategy (9.24) and conventional strategy (8.60) groups. There was no significant main effect of gender on student’s achievement. There was no significant two- way interaction effect of treatment and gender on student’s achievement in Redox concept of chemistry. Concept mapping and guided discovery instructional strategies enhanced student’s achievement in Redox concept of chemistry. It is therefore recommended that chemistry teachers should adopt these strategies to improve student’s achievement in Chemistry.

T1  - Are You a STEM Teacher?: Exploring PK-12 Teachers' Conceptions of STEM Education
AN  - 2680631204
AB  - This study explores teachers' conceptions of STEM education at the beginning of an online graduate course for practicing PK-12 teachers (n=20). A grounded theory approach was used to analyze open-ended survey data and concept maps. Teachers in the study interpreted STEM teaching from either a disciplinary or an integrated perspective. Their conceptions of STEM education within their concept maps fell into one or more of six categories: (1) utilitarian; (2) acquisition of disciplinary knowledge; (3) activities and resources; (4) access to meaningful problem-solving experiences; (5) advocacy for systemic change; and (6) buzzwords. This study reveals the complexity of teachers' conceptions of STEM education as they prepare to integrate STEM in their classrooms. The use of concept maps as a formative assessment can better position teacher educators and professional developers to move teachers toward a more sustainable integrated perspective of STEM teaching.

T1  - Does Learning from Giving Feedback Depend on the Product Being Reviewed: Concept Maps or Answers to Test Questions?
AN  - 2640575654
AB  - Giving feedback to peers can be a valuable learning experience for a feedback provider. However, different types of products require different types of feedback, which, in turn, may lead to different learning outcomes. The current study investigates the effect on the learning of feedback providers of reviewing different types of products. Secondary school students (n =127) were randomly assigned to one of the two conditions: giving peer feedback on either concept maps or answers to open-ended test questions. Both types of product, created by the researchers, were comparable with regard to content: they included the same misconceptions and were both of average quality. Giving peer feedback was part of a chemistry lesson delivered in an online inquiry learning environment. Students’ post-test scores, their own learning products, and the quality of the provided feedback were analysed to check for an effect on learning. There was no difference in post-test scores between the conditions, but the quality of the provided feedback predicted post-test scores. This indicates that it is not the type of product reviewed that matters, but the effort that students put into giving feedback. Possible implications for practice and further research directions are discussed.

AN  - 2638586952
AB  - Purpose>Interpretive research in management accounting and control provides rich insights from empirically based studies, but it has been criticised for lacking generalisability and potential subjectivity. On the latter, triangulation is useful, and this paper aims to offer some insights on a triangulation technique thus far not commonly reported in management accounting/control research.Design/methodology/approach>Drawing on a study of the roles of management accountants in performance management systems, this paper offers some insights from empirical experiences on the use of concept maps as a tool to assist triangulation and improve understanding of complex empirical phenomena.Findings>The concept maps as utilised revealed additional insights which were not recounted by interviewees during the normal interview time. This is a potentially important finding for consideration of future researchers.Practical implications>In this paper, how concept maps were used is detailed, and it is hoped that future researchers will find their use beneficial in interview settings.Originality/value>Thus far, concept maps seem under-utilised in management accounting and control research. This paper gives some initial insights on how they may be used in case study settings.

T1  - A meme-based approach for enhancing student engagement and learning in renal physiology
AN  - 2643277291
AB  - As educators around the world are exploring new approaches to keep students involved in remote learning during the pandemic, we investigated the utility of memes in promoting engagement in the online environment. Medical students enrolled in a human physiology course at the College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Sohar, Oman were provided with an option to create memes related to the learning outcomes in renal physiology. One hundred forty-six of 280 students chose to create memes (52%), and the remaining students chose to submit either a labeled diagram or a concept map. Students uploaded their work in the discussion forum of the learning management system. All students enrolled in the course were given an opportunity for interaction with the uploaded content by commenting and upvoting thereafter. Students were requested to give anonymous feedback on their experience specifically on the activity related to memes. Feedback received from 142 of 280 students through anonymous comments was subjected to thematic analysis. Based on the analysis of the data, we found that memes elicited interest in the topic, facilitated peer interaction, simplified complex ideas, enhanced retention of associated concepts, and fostered a positive learning environment.

T1  - An Internet Articles Retrieval Agent Combined With Dynamic Associative Concept Maps to Implement Online Learning in an Artificial Intelligence Course
AN  - 2670144309
AB  - Online learning has been widely discussed in education research, and open educational resources have become an increasingly popular way to help learners acquire knowledge. However, these resources contain massive amounts of information, making it difficult for learners to identify Web articles that refer to computer science knowledge. This study developed an Internet articles retrieval agent combined with dynamic associative concept maps (DACMs). The system used text mining technology to analyze keywords to filter computer science articles. In previous research, concept maps were manually constructed; in this study, such maps can be automatically and dynamically generated in real time. In a case study of a fundamental course of artificial intelligence, this study designed two experiments to compare students’ learning behaviors while using this system and the Google search engine. The results of the first experiment showed that the experimental group searched for more knowledge articles on computer science using this agent, compared to the control group using the Google search engine. The learning performance of the experimental group was significantly better than that of the control group, while the cognitive load of the experimental group was significantly lower than that of the control group. Furthermore, the results of the second experiment showed that the learning progress of students using the agent was significantly greater than that of students who used the Google search engine. This illustrates that the agent effectively filtered computer science articles, and DACMs helped students gain a deeper understanding of academic concepts and knowledge related to artificial intelligence.

T1  - Muslims and Mental Health Services: A Concept Map and a Theoretical Framework
AN  - 2627872795
AB  - Muslim populations in Western countries are growing, and they face biopsychosocial, spiritual, and economic challenges. Although Islam gives utmost attention to mental health stability, Muslims tend to underutilize mental health services. Mental health professionals, whether they be researchers, practitioners, or trainers working in schools, colleges/universities, mental health agencies, and research institutions, are well positioned to serve Muslims. Mental health professionals can address Muslims’ biopsychosocial and spiritual issues and enhance their quality of life. In the current study, as the authors, we (a) reviewed 300 peer-reviewed manuscripts on Muslim mental health to understand how researchers have used concept maps or theoretical frameworks to design their empirical research, (b) prepared a comprehensive concept map based on the literature review to determine the central concepts affecting Muslims’ approach to the use of mental health services, and (c) proposed a contextual theoretical (conceptual) framework. We titled the framework as Muslims’ approach to use of mental health services based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Theory of Reasoned Action (TPB/TRA) in the context of a Social Ecological Model (SEM). We drew the framework based on TPB/TRA, SEM, and the review of Muslim mental health literature (the concept map). The concept map and the framework provide the most important constructs about challenges Muslim’s face when attempting to utilize mental health services. Future researchers can use the concept map and the framework to conduct theoretically and evidence-based grounded empirical research. We provided implications for researchers, practitioners, educators, and social advocates wishing to contribute to service provision to this population.

T1  - Ho‘ouna Pono implementation: applying concept mapping to a culturally grounded substance use prevention curriculum in rural Hawai‘i schools
AN  - 2850727344
AB  - BackgroundDespite their potential to ameliorate health disparities and address youth substance use, prevention programs have been poorly disseminated and implemented across Hawai‘i, which begs the question: Why are effective prevention programs not being used in communities most in need of them? Implementing and sustaining culturally grounded prevention programs is critical to address equitable healthcare and minimize health disparities in communities. The field of implementation science provides frameworks, theories, and methods to examine factors associated with community adoption of these programs.MethodOur project applies concept mapping methods to a culturally grounded youth drug prevention program with state level educational leadership in rural Hawai‘i schools. The goal is to integrate barrier and facilitator salience collected through teacher and school staff surveys and specific implementation strategies to regionally tailored implementation plans on Hawai‘i island. This protocol paper describes the concept mapping steps and how they will be applied in public and public-charter schools.DiscussionImproving prevention program implementation in rural schools can result in sustained support for populations that need it most. The project will integrate implementation science and culturally grounded methods in rural Hawai‘i, where most youth are of Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander descent. This project addresses health disparities among Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander youth and provides actionable plans for rural Hawai‘i communities to implement effective prevention programming.

T1  - Understanding, Formalizing, and Reconstructing Mental Models with an Online Tool for Serious Discussions
AN  - 2833082612
AB  - We live in a time when humanity faces many existential threats - climate change, resource depletion, biodiversity loss, and refugee crises. Wicked problems need to be properly approached and cannot be solved without human participation, which is hard to organize and support. Participatory modeling (PM) is one method that facilitates stakeholders' engagement in the decision-making process and enables collaboration to achieve a mutually acceptable solution. Mental models are essential tools in PM as they are informal representations of how the world works. The way we perceive, behave, and decide is also influenced by our mental models. Direct observation, learning, and experience can help in maintaining and updating our mental models. At the same time, mental models are constantly relied upon to reason, explain, design, communicate, act, predict, and explore. Overall mental models play an essential role across all domains of human agency. So, a tool that helps to formalize computer simulations from the mental models expressed by a group within a given problem situation will be of much benefit for practitioners from various fields like behavioural science, economics, education, and sustainability as they can gain many insights. We developed a real-time, moderated tool, named Discussoo, for understanding and formalizing mental models of participants of online discussions. Users are presented with a topic to debate, on which they can express their opinions/thoughts in the form of comments. Users can also respond or expand on other users’ opinions and/or initiate a new line of discussion. The discussion chain is then mined in real-time, using an ensemble of algorithms (including but not limited to concept mining, topic modeling, and sentiment analysis) to extract opinions, keywords, and concepts. This information is transcribed into formal models using Concept maps, Causal Loop Diagrams, and Networks Diagrams as the discussion evolves. To provide feedback, the system presents users with dynamic visualizations of the collective mental model, which they can use as contextual information to refine and update their individual mental models. Targeted moderator comments can also introduce feedback to steer or "nudge" the discussion towards a desirable collective mental model, outcome, consensus, or agreement. Discussoo can be used in a variety of settings and problem situations, where the steering of collective mental models could improve the functioning, resilience, or sustainability of a given system or used by policy makers or any other organization who would benefit from a more direct, transparent and meaningful engagement of their stakeholders.

T1  - SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF FACE-TO-FACE ACTIVE LEARNING INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN TO ONLINE SYNCHRONOUS FORMAT DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC
AN  - 2736354089
AB  - Before the pandemic, an introductory pharmaceutics course was redesigned to integrate active deep-learning tasks. Due to COVID-19 pandemic restrictions, the instructor decided to implement a fully synchronous online course format. The primary objective of this study was to analyze the effectiveness of the transfer to the online synchronous context by monitoring its impact on students' performance, perceptions, and beliefs. Findings from this study indicated that highly integrated active learning tasks successfully transferred to the online format. That is, student performance, perceptions, and opinions were similar or slightly better when compared with the face-to-face format of the course.

T1  - Incorporating Immediate Online Feedback System and Concept Map into Electrical Circuits Course
AN  - 2735384739
AB  - Conference Title: 2022 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems (ISCAS)Conference Start Date:  2022,  May  27 Conference End Date:  2022,  June  1 Conference Location: Austin, TX, USAProviding immediate feedback to students of their level of understanding of a concept is important for effective learning and for the instructor to decide to either review the concept or move forward to another. This paper demonstrates concept mapping and a student response system to provide immediate feedback in an Electrical Circuits course. We showed how students’ learning is improved when they receive immediate online feedback about their state of learning from their peers and the instructor. The same course was taught differently in two consecutive years, one with immediate feedback and concept mapping and the other without. The assessment of the impact on students learning using immediate online feedback and concept mapping presented through the student grades for the same course in the two years. The results showed that immediate feedback and concept mapping have a significant and positive effect on student performance.

T1  - Identifying and understanding disease burden in patients with inflammatory bowel disease
AN  - 2734650885
AB  - ObjectivePhysicians tend to focus on biomedical targets while little is known about issues important to patients. We aimed to identify critical concepts impacting patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).DesignWe performed a survey of patients with IBD in biologic therapy (n=172) and used a validated qualitative method called group concept mapping (GCM) in patient workshops. The survey included 13 questions on attitudes toward symptoms and issues related to IBD. In the eight workshops, patients (n=26) generated statements later clustered into concepts identifying issues impacting a patient’s life. Patients ranked the statements.ResultsIn the survey, patients’ mean age were 40 years (SD 13), 53% were women, and 38% had ulcerative colitis. They identified fatigue (57%) and stool frequency (46%) as the most critical symptoms impacting their daily lives regardless of disease activity. In the GCM workshops with Crohn’s disease (n=13) (median age 42 years (IQR 39–51) and 62% were women), 335 statements divided among 10 concepts were generated, and the three most important concepts were ‘Positive attitudes’, ‘Accept and recognition’, and ‘Sharing knowledge and experiences in life with Crohn’s disease’. In the workshops with ulcerative colitis (n=13) (median age 43 years (IQR 36–49) and 69% were women), 408 statements divided into 11 concepts were generated; the most important concepts were ‘Take responsibility and control over your life’, ‘Medication’, and ‘Everyday life with ulcerative colitis’.ConclusionFocusing solely on IBD symptoms, patients identified fatigue and stool frequency to impact daily life the most. However, when investigating the disease burden in a broader perspective beyond classic IBD symptoms, patients identified concepts with focus on emotional health to be most important.Trial registrationThe Copenhagen University Hospital, Herlev and Gentofte approved the questionnaire and methodology (work-zone no: 18015429).

T1  - Facilitating Concept Map Analysis: Generating and Evaluating Representative General Chemistry Concept Maps with a Novel Use of Image J, Gephi, JPathfinder, and R
AN  - 2733789614
AB  - Concept maps are powerful tools used to reveal challenges in students’ learning. However, their use introduces complexities when a large group of students’ conceptualizations need to be examined. In this study, concept maps of 344 general chemistry students were analyzed after grouping them based on achievement in chemistry, math proficiency, and gender. The analysis was also expanded with the consideration of eccentricity values and the extended chemistry triplet. Although some similarities exist between the map of high-achieving students in chemistry and that of high-performing students in the Mathematics Placement Test (MPT), the calculated eccentricity values show interesting variations. On the other hand, the analysis of the map of the low-performing students in MPT and that of low-achieving students in chemistry revealed no clear patterns of symbolic, macroscopic, and submicroscopic terms. Practical suggestions were included to increase the use of representative maps in different assessment and teaching scenarios.

T1  - An evaluation of critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic
AN  - 2731086873
AB  - Purpose>The ability to manage the COVID-19 pandemic is contingent upon the ability to effectively manage its heterogeneous knowledge resources. Knowledge mapping represents a great opportunity to create value by bringing stakeholders together, facilitating comprehensive collaboration and facilitating broader in-depth knowledge sharing and transfer. However, identifying and analysing critical knowledge areas is one of the most important steps when creating a knowledge map. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to appraise the critical knowledge areas for managing COVID-19, and thereby enhance decision-making in tackling the consequences of the pandemic.Design/methodology/approach>The methodological approach for this study is a critical literature review, covering publications on knowledge management, knowledge mapping and COVID-19. EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, TRID, Web of Science and Wiley Online Library were searched for full text, peer-reviewed articles written in English that investigated on critical knowledge areas for managing the spread of COVID-19. After full screening, 21 articles met the criteria for inclusion and were analysed and reported.Findings>The study revealed seven critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. These are cleaning and disinfection; training, education and communication; reporting guidance and updates; testing; infection control measures, personal protective equipment; and potential COVID-19 transmission in health and other care settings. The study developed a concept knowledge map illustrating areas of critical knowledge which decision-makers need to be aware of.Practical implications>Providing decision-makers with access to key knowledge during the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be crucial for effective decision-making. This study has provided insights for the professionals and decision-makers identifying the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic.Social implications>The study advances the literature on knowledge management and builds a theoretical link with the management of public health emergencies. Additionally, the findings support the theoretical position that knowledge maps facilitate decision-making and help users to identify critical knowledge areas easily and effectively.Originality/value>This study fills gaps in the existing literature by providing an explicit representation of know-how for managing the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper uses an objective and qualitative approach by reviewing related publications, reports and guidelines in the analysis. The concept map illustrates the critical knowledge areas for managing the COVID-19 pandemic.

T1  - Vocational Training With Microlearning—How Low-Immersive 360-Degree Learning Environments Support Work-Process-Integrated Learning
AN  - 2728572222
AB  - In-company training is facing new challenges in preparing employees for the demands of digitalized and automated manufacturing. New training concepts like microlearning are necessary to support work-process-related learning. To handle the limitations of microlearning, we develop a 360-degree learning system to demonstrate a realistic work environment and overcome the lack of design knowledge supporting the motivation and performance of employees using such systems. Based on a systematic literature review and semistructured interviews, we have developed design requirements for interactive 360-degree learning environments. We used a workshop-based mixed-method approach with interviews, concept maps, and video analysis to evaluate the motivation and performance of precision mechanics within a prototypical work-process-oriented learning environment in an intercompany vocational training center. The results show a positive effect on learning outcomes and motivation. In addition, the ease of use and sense of presence while using the learning environment are rated as high. We contribute to theory by shedding new light on learners’ motivation and performance within work-process-oriented interactive 360-degree learning environments. Furthermore, we offer guidelines for developing interactive 360-degree learning environments against the background of the current metaverse discussion.

T1  - Making Sense of and Navigating the Stem Vapor: A Qualitative Study of a Single School Community’s Attempts to Understand the Stem Institution
AN  - 2719106122
AB  - Despite its significant role in every level of education, the definition of the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics movement, or STEM, has remained elusive, becoming so vaporous as to provide little meaning. As education organizations navigate the STEM institution, they must collectively make sense of its norms, goals, and practices. Yet little is known about this process, including what sense is made, contributing factors, and implications. This paper describes a study guided by relational ethnography conducted in one K-8 school community that investigates how its members make sense of the STEM institution through cycles of interpretation and action. Sensemaking is investigated through interviews, concept maps, and surveys conducted with nine teachers, administrators, and external partners in the community along with analysis of school and external organization documents. Results are organized around three themes: the external nature of STEM, the process of sensemaking, and collective sensemaking in partnerships. First, the tension between the messy, amorphous institution of STEM and the organizational and personal context of teachers, disciplines, school, and community is described. It is proposed that the interpretation of STEM as external to the local context may contribute to a problem of curriculum narrowing, whereby aspects of disciplinary instruction, namely higher-order thinking skills, are also omitted. Second, four key factors influencing sensemaking of STEM are demonstrated: individual frames, disparate messaging from the environment, collaboration, or the lack thereof, and external partnerships. The factors are shown to provide dual obstacles to implementation of STEM as well as to contextual, collective sensemaking about STEM. Third, an investigation of external partnerships provide evidence for the institutions’ messy and inequitable qualities. The paper concludes with a theory that resistance to STEM implementation demonstrated by study participants suggests problems lie not with a lack of clear institutional messages, but with an understanding by teachers that STEM, as presented, has little to do with their practice. Therefore, efforts to use STEM as a vehicle for implementing standards-based practices like higher-order thinking skills may be problematic. The paper concludes with proposals for research understanding the conflict between STEM and contextual, disciplinary practice, including epistemological and structural tensions.

T1  - Using Systems Maps to Visualize Chemistry Processes: Practitioner and Student Insights
AN  - 2716517325
AB  - Discussing socio-scientific issues in a secondary chemistry classroom poses a challenge to traditional classroom practice because students and teachers need to think more broadly about chemical processes. Allowing students to create open-ended maps to generate and represent their understanding of socio-scientific issues while also learning chemistry theory can develop Systems Thinking capacity in students. This manuscript presents three vignettes of the classroom use of mapping exercises within separate action research studies, involving diverse school types, curricula, chemistry topics and student groups. The mapping exercises were effective to engage students in the development of Systems Thinking and were readily integrated into different curricula. Sequential student-generated maps for chemical processes illustrate increasing sophistication in their Systems Thinking approaches.

T1  - Same yardstick, different results: efficacy of rubrics in science education assessment
AN  - 2707689835
AB  - Assessments have become integral to today's teaching and learning. Within the world of assessments, there are two paramount ideologies at work: assessments for learning and assessments of learning. The latter are typically administered at the end of a unit or grading period and evaluate a student’s understanding by comparing their achievement against a class, nationwide benchmark, or standard. The former assesses a student’s understanding of a skill or lesson during the learning and teaching process. Assessment for learning enables teachers to collect data that will help them adjust their teaching strategies, and students to adjust their learning strategies. In order to achieve this goal, teachers can make use of several assessment tools, such as concept maps, oral presentations, peer review, portfolios, examinations, written reports, and rubrics. The use of rubrics not only makes the teacher’s standards and result grading explicit but can give students a clear sense of what the expectations are for a high level of performance on a given science assignment. In this study, quantitative data were collected from tasks, assessed by 10 teachers who were purposefully sampled; while qualitative data were collected from interview responses of the same teachers to explore the extent of uniformity in the use of rubrics. The researchers compared and analyzed the different scores, allocated by the respective participants, and analyzed the qualitative data using qualitative data analysis. The study suggests that if interpreted and used well, rubrics support learning by enabling an efficient, consistent, objective, and quick way of assessing students’ work thereby facilitating learning.

T1  - Strengthening Deep Learning in a Professional Doctorate Pharmaceutics Course: Perceived Impact on Students' Self-Efficacy
AN  - 2701145995
AB  - To stimulate and strengthen a culture of deep learning associated with problem-solving, two complementary instructional strategies, productive failure and instructor-designed concept maps, were introduced to pharmacy students in an introductory pharmaceutical course. This study describes the impact of the two instructional deep-learning strategies on pharmacy students' perceptions and beliefs. The analysis of a proposed path model indicated that students' perceived impact of the two instructional strategies were significant predictors of self-efficacy. The results of this study indicated that the combination of the productive failure and instructor-designed concept maps significantly impacted students' perceptions and beliefs on their ability to perform well in the course. The qualitative data related to the perceived strengths and weaknesses provided additional support for these findings and revealed more details regarding the perceived benefits of this instructional strategy. Future research will focus on student-generated concept maps' impact on transfer problems associated with productive failure.

T1  - Reflection of Concept Modelling on Student Teachers’ Learning Experiences From a Primary Education Perspective
AN  - 2688904093
AB  - It is important to be able to make better informed decisions about issues such as sustainability and climate change that have both personal and global impact as early as possible in life. Primary teachers have a significant role in supporting students’ learning and understanding of these concepts. One important teaching skill that needs to be improved for understand sustainable development is the creation of meaningful generalizations, including models. Therefore, the learning experiences of pre-service primary teachers (N = 28) in regard to modelling was our focus. The results of our case study indicated concrete and visual modes as most common in student teachers’ experiences and understandings of modelling. The symbolic mode is less in evidence and an understanding of gestural and verbal models is rather unambiguous. Thus, we see a need and the potential to improve teaching and learning experiences in teacher education about the modelling of complex concepts.

T1  - Seek-and-Find-Drawings in the Research of Students’ Conceptions in Computer Science Education
AN  - 2662097131
AB  - Conference Title: 2022 IEEE Global Engineering Education Conference (EDUCON)Conference Start Date:  2022,  March  28 Conference End Date:  2022,  March  31 Conference Location: Tunis, TunisiaResearch into students’ conceptions is inherently challenged with appropriately transferring profound research questions into suitable research instruments. This applies in particular, but not exclusively, to studies with primary school students. In order to investigate individuals’ conceptions, besides linear-linguistic questionnaire procedures, classically guided interviews are used, also triangulated with each other or further sub-instruments (e.g. concept mapping techniques). For this latter purpose, seek-and-find-drawings offer a good opportunity, both paper based and digital. This paper presents research on primary school students’ conceptions of computers in everyday objects and illustrates a methodical opportunity regarding the use of seek-and-find-drawings in Computer Science Education research. In the presented study, 60 primary school children were presented with a seek-and-find-drawing depicting several everyday encounter situations with computing systems. According to the results, primary school students understand not only personal computers, smartphones, tablets, video gaming consoles and (video) cameras, but in few cases also refrigerators, air conditioners and cars as systems containing (embedded) computers. The experience from the presented paper based hidden objects study can be used especially for future research projects.

T1  - Using A Three-Tier Multiple-Choice Diagnostic Instrument Toward Alternative Conceptions Among Lower-Secondary School Students In Taiwan: Taking Ecosystems Unit As An Example
AN  - 2641949920
AB  - This research is conducted to identify the scientific conceptual cognition of ecosystem and the corresponding alternative conceptions by lower-secondary school students in Taiwan. Concept mapping, interviewing, and two-tier diagnostic test cannot make explicit reasoning pathways that students may use. Therefore, its purpose is to develop, validate, and utilize a three-tier multiple-choice diagnostic instrument for the ecosystem concept (TDIEC). The instrument can assist teachers in analyzing their students’ reasoning. This does not only distinguish alternative conceptions from lack of knowledge but also determines the percentages of false positives and false negatives. One hundred and six students were tested with this instrument in Taiwan. The data analysis reveals common alternative conceptions shared by students, indicating that 35.59% of the samples had inaccurate conceptualizations of ecosystems. Common alternative conceptions of ecosystems include the following: (i) Only biological components constitute an ecosystem; (ii) The Venus flytrap and pitcher plants are preys; (iii) Competition is synonymous to predation; (iv) Ecological balance refers to the sustainable circulation of energy and matter in the environment; and (v) The simpler the species, the more stable the ecosystem. It concludes with the interpretation of the results, suggestions for the application of the TDIEC, and correct alternative conceptions in Ecology classes.

T1  - Enhancing higher education student well-being through social prescribing: a realist evaluation protocol
AN  - 2638123216
AB  - IntroductionUK higher education (HE) student numbers are increasing and students report higher levels of mental health and well-being issues. Social prescribing links individuals to community-based, non-medical support. It is widely implemented throughout the UK, and is supported by the Welsh Government. This protocol presents an evaluation of a new social prescribing service to enhance student well-being, a first for UK HE students.Methods and analysisA realist evaluation to articulate why, how and to what extent and circumstances social prescribing works for students, using a mixed-methods sequential design of four cycles. Cycle 1 informs the model and programme theory development of how the model works; activities include a Realist Review, Group Concept Mapping and producing bilingual short films about the evaluation and model. Cycle 2 involves secondary analysis of routine service data, and outcome measurements from students receiving a social prescription. Cycle 3 uses reflective diaries and qualitative realist interviews with stakeholders to understand the process and outcome of the model. Cycle 4 concludes with a world café workshop with stakeholders to agree and finalise the framework specification of ‘how, why, when and to what extent’ the model works. A meta-matrix construction will determine convergence, complementarity or discrepancy across the cycles. An advisory group of key stakeholders informs each cycle.Ethics and disseminationUniversity of South Wales Life Sciences and Education Ethics Committee and Wrexham Glyndwr University (WGU) Research Ethics Sub-Committee approved secondary data analysis of participant demographics (200 805LRL:USW, id441:WGU), outcome measurement tools (200 902LR:USW, id441:WGU) and qualitative data collection (200 804LR:USW, id449:WGU). The authors will publish findings in peer-reviewed journals, produce an evaluation report to the funder and a short film for dissemination via stakeholders, university networks, United Nations Regional Centre of Expertise in Wales, PRIME Centre Wales, Wales School for Social Prescribing Research, conferences and social media.

T1  - PIMCA: A New Alternatives to Physics Learning Model
AN  - 2635865044
AB  - The general development of knowledge in physics particulary, requires the ability to understand the right and obey the principles. This study purposed to carried out the use of learning models to ensure a quality learning process with the right concepts and avoid misconceptions. The learning model is also adaptive to the 4.0 era demands and the special situation of the pandemic era. The learning model is PIMCA (presentation-idea mapping-conceptualization-assessment formative). The PIMCA learning model is based on the main theories of educational psychology, such as behavioristic, cognitive, constructivist, and humanistic. It was conducted to students in the physics education department at Manado State University, used experimental study in various fields of physics studies such as waves, optics, electricity, and magnetism, it was found that the average achievement of learning progress from the pre-test and post-test was 73.14%. Likewise, in terms of conceptual understanding of physics, namely from idea maps and concept maps, an average increase of up to 84% is obtained. The major findings of this study indicate that the PIMCA learning model can be effectively used as an alternative in learning physics. Study using PIMCA learning models needs to be continued to be applied to the learning of physics in the field of mechanics and modern physics, as well as in the learning of mathematics, science, including biology-chemistry-geology and astronomy, and engineering.

T1  - Evolution of hospitality and tourism technology research from Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology: a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis
AN  - 2634820747
AB  - Purpose>Information and communication technologies have been widely implemented and made radical changes for several decades in the hospitality and tourism industry. This rapid development also generates considerable data in social media. This trend opens the door to analyze unstructured data and gain increased attention of a qualitative research approach from hospitality and tourism researchers and industry professionals. Therefore, this paper aims to describe how a computer-assisted qualitative data analysis (CAQDA) approach can be used in the hospitality and tourism technology literature to uncover the trends and thematic concepts of hospitality and tourism technology research and their dynamics in Journal of Hospitality and Tourism Technology (JHTT)Design/methodology/approach>To achieve the proposed research goals, the current study used CAQDA software, Leximancer, to analyze 218 articles published in JHTT between Volume 1(1) in 2010 and Volume 10(4) in 2019. Based on the rigorous CAQDA processes, the study performed the thematic analysis using all articles and subgroup analyses in the five-year periods.Findings>Using CAQDA, the study reveals the critical research trends and insights on hospitality and tourism technology for 10 years in the JHTT. The findings of this study can provide strong evidence of what hospitality and tourism technology research topics have been examined and how these topics were connected and changed over time. More importantly, the current study illustrates how the CAQDA approach can be applied to uncover the hidden trends and thematic concepts from text data in the hospitality and tourism literature.Originality/value>This study is the first attempt to apply CAQDA software to identify research trends and thematic concepts and gain insights from past JHTT’s articles. Moreover, this study applies this software to describe how hospitality and tourism researchers can use one of the modern computer-assisted qualitative techniques. Based on the findings of this study, theoretical and methodological implications for hospitality and tourism researchers are provided. More importantly, the current study presents the specific guidelines of how the CAQDA approach can be used for the literature review.

T1  - Belonging in Science: Democratic Pedagogies for Cross-Cultural PhD Supervision
AN  - 2632722557
AB  - This research used Novakian concept mapping and interview techniques to track changes in knowledge and understanding amongst students and their supervisors in the course of full-time research towards a laboratory science-based PhD. This detailed longitudinal case study analysis measures both cognitive change in the specific subjects that are the topic for research, and the understanding of the process of PhD level research and supervision. The data show the challenges for students and supervisors from different national, ethnic, cultural, and academic backgrounds and traditions with a focus on how this impacts the PhD research process and development. Working cross-culturally, and often in a setting different from either the student or the supervisor’s background and training, can lead to a lack of common language and understanding for the development of a pedagogically oriented supervisory relationship. Documenting change in knowledge and understanding among PhD students and their supervisors is key to surfacing what the joint processes of mutual democratic research and of supervision may entail. This study explores how one of these key processes is a student’s developing sense of belonging (or non-belonging). Specifically, this paper engages the concepts of belonging, and democratic education through mutual learning, to explore the practices of working across national, cultural, ethnic, and diverse academic backgrounds, for both supervisors and students. Doctoral study is understood as a situated context in which belonging also acts as a gateway for who can join the global scientific community.

T1  - Sustaining student wellness in higher educational institutions: Possible design principles and implementations strategies
AN  - 2629556633
AB  - Popular discourse identifies education as the cure for many of society’s ills. However, surviving university is often seen as a period in which students face a unique array of challenges. Many students begin their tertiary education as holistically-well individuals, but due to the stressors related to University, students often show incremental signs of psychological, physical and emotional distress. These often lead to a decrease in academic competence and severe professional ramifications. The aim of this study was to identify design principles and explore the perceptions of professionals concerning possible implementation strategies that could be suitable for Higher Educational Institutions, particularly Health Science and Medical School students. A qualitative, three-phase multi-approach design was used in this study. Phase one was conducted by means of an explorative desktop literature review, there after phase 2 included a self-management, self-coaching and appreciative coaching concept map, that was aligned to concepts within the current individual wellness literature and in phase 3, Appreciative Inquiry based focus group discussions were held with various professional in the field of coaching, education, and healthcare. Wellness programmes are impacted by the fact that Higher Education Institutions face unique challenges such as time, financial constraints, and an already overloaded curriculum. Five design principles were described, and various implementation strategies explored. There is a fundamental necessity to address the distortion of wellness within HE. A key finding in this study suggests that combining self-coaching, appreciative coaching and self-management principles could facilitate a successful individual wellness programme for higher educational students.

T1  - Are Elementary Preservice Teachers Floating or Sinking in Their Understanding of Buoyancy?
AN  - 2619747250
AB  - This research study investigated conceptions about buoyancy held by 55 elementary preservice teachers enrolled in a science methods course who participated in an instructional intervention designed to increase their knowledge about buoyancy. Pre- and post-concept maps were analyzed using a paired sample t test and thematic analysis was used to interpret narratives, drawings, and interview data. There was a statistically significant difference (t = −3.504, p = .001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD = .879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The total number of accurate propositions increased between the pre- and post-concept maps. The drawings revealed that most participants (66%) had alternative conceptions about how gravity is related to buoyancy and the role it plays in floating and sinking. Data from the interviews triangulated with other data sources that showed gains in scientific conceptions such as opposing forces (53%) and surface area (33%), while documenting the persistence of serious alternative conceptions about floating and sinking (49%), the key role of fluid density (56%), and density of an object (62%).

T1  - Building upon the foundational science curriculum with physiology-based grand rounds: a multi-institutional program evaluation
AN  - 2609935086
AB  - Introduction: Vertically integrating physiology into patient care has the potential to improve clinical reasoning. Clinical Physiology Grand Rounds (CPGR) is a case-based teaching method that brings together students from all years of medical school to focus on linking clinical presentations to core basic science concepts including anatomy, physiology, and pathophysiology. In this study, we describe the implementation of CPGR at two different institutions in the United States and assess student-reported outcomes.Methods: We survey students who participated in CPGR at Columbia University College of Physicians & Surgeons (P&S) and Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC). Subjects were queried across three domains: the benefits of attending, the impact of concept maps, and the impact of the mixed-learner environment.Results: Despite differences in session leadership and the underlying medical school curricula, conference attendees reported similar benefits at the two schools included in this study. Students overwhelmingly (92.9%) reported that remembering clinical presentations was easier when they understood the underlying physiology. They also reported gaining a true understanding of concepts that were previously memorized (87.5%). Both clinical (92.5%) and preclinical students (93.1%) valued the mixed-learner environment as a component of the conference.Discussion: By assuring a mixed-learner environment with near-peer interactions, using concept maps as a teaching tool, and rigorously linking clinical presentation and management to physiological concepts, we found that the key benefits of CPGR were replicable across different institutions, despite several local differences in how CPGR was implemented, led, and conducted.

T1  - Improving Elementary Grade Students’ Science and Social Studies Vocabulary Knowledge Depth, Reading Comprehension, and Argumentative Writing: a Conceptual Replication
AN  - 2598838059
AB  - This experimental study aimed to replicate and extend a previous efficacy study of an elementary grade content literacy intervention that demonstrated positive effects on students’ vocabulary knowledge depth, argumentative writing, and reading comprehension. Using a cluster (school) randomized trial design, this replication experiment was conducted with 5,494 first- and second-grade students in 30 elementary schools in an urban school district located in the southeastern USA. Teachers implemented thematic lessons (20 lessons) that provided an intellectual framework for helping students who acquire networks of related vocabulary knowledge while learning science and social studies content. Teachers integrated thematic lessons, concept mapping, and interactive read-alouds of conceptually related informational texts to enable their students to build networks of vocabulary knowledge and to transfer this knowledge to argumentative writing and collaborative research activities. Confirmatory analyses replicated positive findings on science vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.50) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.24) and also extended positive findings to social studies vocabulary knowledge depth (ES = 0.56) and argumentative writing (ES = 0.44). Positive and statistically significant findings were not replicated on domain-general reading comprehension. Exploratory analyses indicated that students’ vocabulary knowledge depth partially mediated the impact of content literacy instruction on domain-specific argumentative writing outcomes.

T1  - The role of health literacy in cancer care: A mixed studies systematic review
AN  - 2596927167
AB  - Background 
Patients diagnosed with cancer face many challenges and need a good understanding of their diagnosis and proposed treatments to make informed decisions about their care. Health literacy plays an important role in this and low health literacy has been associated with poorer outcomes. The aims of this review are to identify which outcomes relate to health literacy in patients with cancer, and to combine this through a mixed studies approach with the patient experience as described through qualitative studies.
 Methods 
Four electronic databases were searched in January 2021 to identify records relating to health literacy and patients with cancer. Records were independently screened then assessed for inclusion by two reviewers according to the following criteria: patients aged ≥18 years with cancer, English language publication AND health literacy measured with validated tool and measured outcome associated with health literacy OR qualitative study exploring the role of health literacy as patients make decisions about health. Quality was independently assessed by two reviewers. A narrative synthesis was performed, and findings integrated through concept mapping. This systematic review was registered with PROSPERO, entry CRD42020166454.
 Results 
4441 records were retrieved. Following de-duplication, 2496 titles and abstracts were screened and full texts of 405 papers were reviewed for eligibility. 66 papers relating to 60 studies met the eligibility criteria. Lower health literacy was associated with greater difficulties understanding and processing cancer related information, poorer quality of life and poorer experience of care. Personal and situational influences contributed to how participants processed information and reached decisions about their care.
 Conclusion 
This review highlights the important role of health literacy for patients with cancer. Outcomes are poorer for those who experience difficulties with health literacy. Further efforts should be made to facilitate understanding, develop health literacy and support patients to become more involved in their care.

T1  - Using DIME maps and STEM project-based learning to teach physics
AN  - 2652818361
AB  - Purpose>The purpose of this study is to examine a week-long science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) project-based learning (PBL) activity that integrates a new educational technology and the engineering design process to teach middle and high school students the concepts involved in rotational physics. The technology and teaching method described in this paper can be applied to a wide variety of STEM content areas.Design/methodology/approach>As an educational technology, the dynamic and interactive mathematical expressions (DIME) map system automatically generates an interactive, connected concept map of mathematically based concepts extracted from a portable document format textbook chapter. Over five days, students used DIME maps to engage in meaningful self-guided learning within the engineering design process and STEM PBL.Findings>Using DIME maps within a STEM PBL activity, students explored the physics behind spinning objects, proposed multiple creative designs and built a variety of spinners to meet specified criteria and constraints.Practical implications>STEM teachers can use DIME maps and STEM PBL to support their students in making connections between what they learn in the classroom and real-world scenarios.Social implications>For any classroom with computers, tablets or phones and an internet connection, DIME maps are an accessible educational technology that provides an alternative representation of knowledge for learners who are underserved by traditional methods of instruction.Originality/value>For STEM teachers and education researchers, the activity described in this paper uses advances in technology (DIME maps and slow-motion video capture on cell phones) and pedagogy (STEM PBL and the engineering design process) to enable students to engage in meaningful learning.

T1  - Self-Descriptions of High-Performing and Regular-Performing Primary School Students: An Open, Exploratory Study
AN  - 2586679952
AB  - This study examined self-descriptions of high-performing students and other students and compared the descriptions of these two groups. The concept map, with the open-ended question “Who am I?,” was completed by 133 high-performing students and 160 other students. The self-descriptions of these students were subdivided into eleven categories. High-performing students reported mainly characteristics and skills, followed by sport. This pattern was reversed for the other students. School or scholastic skills, both positive and negative, were mentioned more often by high-performing students. Other notable differences between those groups and specific age and gender differences are discussed. The insights from this study are relevant for science, because studies concerning self-concept of primary school students are scarce, and for educational practice, because teachers might use concept maps in their classroom.

T1  - A System Dynamics Approach to Entrepreneurship Applied to the Case of the Creative Arts Industry
AN  - 2753743557
AB  - This paper presents a new approach for innovative entrepreneurial thinking by integrating a number system thinking and system dynamics tools. The proposed approach is applied in the case of the creative arts industry, where it is demonstrated how from a static picture provided by a traditional tool such as the Business Model Canvas (BMC) we can get to a dynamic model with causal feedback loops among the main elements of the business environment. Such a system dynamics model would significantly support spotting opportunities, enhancing creativity, and valuing ideas in order to promote innovation and differentiation. This is in line with the work done on developing innovative thinking competencies for Creative Arts entrepreneurship, which is a European project co-funded by the Erasmus + programme. Such innovative thinking competencies would also support the European Entrepreneurial Competencies Framework (Entrecomp). As a result new business strategies may be formulated and explored on their future effectiveness prior to implementation. Further, the proposed approach would be useful for finding ways to accelerate the diffusion of innovation by configuring important variables, such as advertising and promotion expenditure, as well as investing on building a brand name via good reputation. Such a systemic configuration would increase product/service adoption rate, which in turn would increase the chances for survival and prosperity of the entrepreneurial venture.

T1  - Reflections on How Tinnitus Impacts the Lives of Children and Adolescents
AN  - 2717340961
AB  - Objectives The aim of this study was to generate a conceptual framework describing which aspects of children and adolescents' lives are affected by chronic tinnitus.Design Views and experiences of 32 participants from two participant groups informed this study: (a) a tinnitus group, consisting of adults who had experienced tinnitus during childhood and/or adolescence and primary carers of children/adolescents with tinnitus, and (b) a clinicians' group, consisting of clinicians who provided care for children/adolescents with tinnitus. Participants produced statements describing aspects of children/adolescents' lives that may be affected by chronic tinnitus. Key concepts were identified through the processes of sorting the statements and rating them for degree of associated impact.Result Participants identified 118 unique aspects of the lives of children/adolescents who may be affected by chronic tinnitus. These were clustered into four concepts: (a) emotional well-being, (b) academic performances, (c) social/relationa, and (d) auditory/cognitive processing. At a group level, participants rated the impact of tinnitus as above a slight degree but below a moderate degree of impact. However, individual participant's ratings indicated a range of perceived impact for each statement.Conclusions The experience of chronic tinnitus during childhood and adolescence extends beyond the mere perception of sound. The perception of tinnitus may impact a child's emotional well-being, academic performances, social/relational, and auditory/cognitive processing. The impact of tinnitus in one aspect of a child's life may influence other aspects of their life. While at a group level, participants regarded the impact of tinnitus as “somewhat more than mild” to “less than moderate”; individual participant's ratings indicate that the impact from chronic tinnitus may be highly individual and highlighted the importance of individual assessment and management. Clinically, tinnitus management during childhood and adolescence may be improved if clinicians consider the impact and manifestation of tinnitus within each child's daily life and tailor tinnitus education and management strategies accordingly.

T1  - Collective conceptualization of parental support of dual career athletes: The EMPATIA framework
AN  - 2575311281
AB  - Background 
This study aimed to use a concept mapping methodology to develop a European framework of the needs of parents/guardians (P/G) for supporting athletes combining sport and education (dual career, DC).
 Methods 
By means of a concept mapping methodology, 337 French, Irish, Italian, Portuguese, and Slovenian parents sorted and rated 80 potential statements associated to parenting DC athletes.
 Results 
Five distinct clusters emerged: 1. P/G’ roles, needs and awareness to support athletes, including 22 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2–4.2 pt); 2. Requirements for effective planning of DC pathway, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.2–4.5 pt); 3. Educational opportunity, including 13 statements (mean:3.5; range: 3.1–4.0 pt); 4. Policy and provision for DC, including 19 statements (mean:3.7; range: 3.1–4.2 pt); and 5. Athletes’ lifestyle & self-management, including 7 statements (mean:4.0; range: 3.5–4.5 pt). Estimates of effect size (Partial eta-squared) were calculated for ANOVAs to assess the degree of variability on the statement importance ranking as the dependent variable accounted for by the demographic data.
The concept mapping showed good validity (stress value: 0.11) and high reliability (rSHT: 0.99, rSHM: 0.98; rRR:0.98). One-third of the statements indicated differences (p<0.05) in relation to the P/Gs’ gender and the athletes’ education level, competition level and sport typology.
 Conclusion 
In synthesizing the opinions, experience and needs of P/Gs of DC athletes the present framework provided sound theoretical underpinnings to inform the development of an online educational programme for empowering parenting DC athletes (https://edu.empatiasport.eu/eng/), as well as be a foundation for future Pan-European DC research on how these statements interact with each other, in different European contexts.

T1  - Promoting children's inquiry performances in alternate reality games: A mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach
AN  - 2561258704
AB  - Active inquiry plays a key role in science education. To facilitate children's motivation, alternate reality games are applied to engage children actively in inquiry in authentic learning contexts. However, the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of game puzzles increase the difficulty for children to conduct effective inquiries. To achieve successful inquiry‐based learning, concept mapping is an effective learning strategy to guide children to organise related information as well as to brainstorm for possible solutions. Accordingly, this study proposes a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach for environmental education. A quasi‐experimental study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the conventional questioning approach in game‐based inquiry‐based learning. The results showed that the proposed approach had a more significant effect on learning achievement, critical thinking, and learning attitude than the conventional questioning approach. However, cognitive overload negatively affected the children's learning. Besides, it was found that improper use of concept maps could limit their creative problem‐solving performances.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this topicAlternate reality game (ARG) significantly promotes children’s learning motivation and engagement of game‐based inquiry learning activities.Most children have difficulties in learning with ARGs due to the complexity of real‐world contexts and the ambiguity of the puzzles.Children cannot construct knowledge effectively without proper learning supports in their cognitive process; however, it is challenge to provide proper learning supports without distracting children from gaming.What this paper addsAn ARG with a mobile concept mapping‐based questioning approach (ARG‐CMQ) was applied to facilitate meaningful inquiry‐based learning for children in different real environments (school campuses and in science museums).Both quantitative and qualitative analyses were examined to identify the effect of different learning strategies to support children learning with ARGs.ARG‐CMQ improved children’s learning achievement, critical thinking and learning attitude better than conventional ARGs.ARG‐CMQ might limit children’s divergent thinking and influences their creative problem‐solving performance.Implications for practice and/or policyARG‐CMQ is a potential approach for inquiry‐based learning in real environments, especially in improving learning perceptions and higher‐order cognitive abilities.ARG‐CMQ can be used to support competency‐based education.

T1  - How is clinical credibility defined in nursing? A concept mapping study
AN  - 2557933102
AB  - AimTo develop a working definition of ‘clinical credibility’ in nursing science.MethodsThis is stage 2 of a registered report. Concept mapping methodology, 1. Preparation, 2. Generation of statements (brainstorming), 3. Structuring of statements (prioritising/clustering), 4. Representation of statements, 5. Interpretation of maps and 6. Utilisation of maps were used. Part 1 of our registered report followed the required items on the SPIRIT 2013 checklist. Part 2 was reporting the results of our study adhered to the STROBE reporting guidelines.ResultsParticipants (n = 67) from three stakeholder groups participated in this study. Nursing students (n = 23), nurses and other healthcare professionals (n = 23), and patients (within the last 12 months) (n = 21).Participants (n = 62) generated statements (n = 429) in response to the question: ‘What does clinical credibility mean to you?’. Following statement reduction, participants (n = 61) prioritised and clustered (n = 80) statements. The data were analysed using the concept mapping software, Ariadne. A visual ‘concept map’ was produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by all participants. The final concept map had nine clusters. In order of importance these are as follows: 1. Safe practice, 2. Communication, 3. Patient‐centred care, 4. Accountable, 5. Professional practice, 6. Clinical competence, 7. Teaching attributes, 8. Contemporary expert and 9. Leadership. This study was undertaken over an eight‐month period.ConclusionClinical credibility is not necessarily about contemporary clinical practice. It is a multidimensional construct of which current clinical practice is one element.

T1  - How is clinical credibility defined in nursing? Protocol for a concept mapping study
AN  - 2557932641
AB  - AimTo develop a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science.BackgroundIn both academic and clinical settings, the phrase “clinical credibility” is used when discussing the education of health professionals. No clear definition for the concept is evident in the academic literature. To date, there has not been a study undertaken to develop a working definition of clinical credibility in nursing science.MethodsThis protocol is stage 1 of a registered report. We will use concept mapping to compare and organise views of three stakeholder groups: nursing students (n = 20) from years 2 or 3 of a three‐year Bachelor of Nursing Programme, nurses and other health professionals (n = 20) still practising within a clinical setting, and people who have recently been inpatients in hospital (n = 20). First, participants will take part in separate stakeholder focus groups to generate statements about “What is clinical credibility?”. Second, the same participants will complete two tasks: (1) rank the importance of each statement (prioritising) and (2) put the statements that appear to go together into groups (clustering). The data will then be analysed using a specialised software program called Ariadne. A visual “concept map” will be produced showing the importance and relationship of each statement as viewed by the participants. The projected timeline for the study is one year. The paper complies with the SPIRIT 2013 guidelines for study protocols adapted for mixed methods research.ConclusionThe findings of this study will provide a working definition of the concept of “clinical credibility” in nursing science.Relevance to clinical practiceThe findings can be used to develop a measure of clinical credibility to predict student satisfaction and patient safety outcomes.

T1  - Concept Mapping and Summary Writing as Complementary Strategies for Developing EFL Content Comprehension
AN  - 2622241522
AB  - This is an exploratory study in an undergraduate EFL business-writing course studying participants' ability to read, comprehend, and represent text visually using concept mapping (CM), summary writing, and social network analysis techniques as complementary strategies. The idea with this experiment was to explore if students are capable of analyzing business and technology information from technical readings in a way to represent it graphically with CMs and social networks. Preliminary data from the case study showed that students were reasonably successful in processing texts on topics related to the Tesla electric car company's business and technology models. Multiple iterations and guided instructions when designing CMs demonstrated the interplay of various actors, processes, interactions, and contexts. Student performance indicated significant expertise with CM design and text summarization but inadequate performance designing social networks, indicating the necessity for more structured instructions and practice.

T1  - Teaching and learning of electric charge with PIMCA model
AN  - 2555407044
AB  - Research on the physics learning of electric charge has been carried out using MR-SR (Multiple Representation and Semiotic Resources). The research aims to find out the outcomes of student learning using the PIMCA learning model (Presentation, Idea Mapping, Conceptualization, and Assessment formative) introduced and developed by Cosmas Poluakan. The research was conducted at the Department of Physics, Manado State University, with 22 pre-service teacher students as respondents using the One Group Pre-test-Post-test Design. The instruments used in the form of pre-test and post-test which have been tested and validated. The research implementation stage starts from the pre-test, and then the implementation of physics learning follows the 4 steps of the PIMCA model. The results of data processing and analysis obtained an average pre-test score is 18,88 and an average post-test score is 75,16. There was an increase in concept mastery. In the idea mapping stage only 2 concepts are correct to drafting concept mapping, 6 are correct from 10 concepts that were used as references. PIMCA MR-SR learning model is very effective in helping students find and understand the correct concepts of physics. The use of the PIMCA MR-SR as a new model in the teaching and learning process is very effective in learning physics, mathematics and science or in the STEM area.

T1  - Analyzing student thinking reflected in self-constructed cognitive maps and its influence on inquiry task performance
AN  - 2550951667
AB  - Higher-order thinking is crucial to inquiry learning. It is important to investigate how students think in inquiry contexts. Given the tacit nature of higher-order thinking, cognitive maps (e.g., concept maps, reasoning maps) have been used to externalize thinking and have shown promising effects in terms of improving inquiry task performance. However, few studies have analyzed student-constructed maps that reflect the thinking underpinning students’ inquiry task performance. This study aimed to address this gap. Sixty-nine 11th grade students worked in small groups to explain a fish die-off phenomenon in a virtual ecosystem and collaboratively constructed an integrative cognitive map to facilitate thinking during the task. The map comprised a concept map (representing conceptual thinking about relevant subject knowledge) and a reasoning map (representing the reasoning process). Regression analyses showed that the quality of the student-constructed maps, particularly the reasoning maps, was a significant predictor of inquiry task performance assessed based on students’ written explanations of the phenomenon. Although the quality of the concept maps was not a significant predictor of inquiry task performance, it did predict the quality of the reasoning maps. Student thinking reflected in concept mapping and that reflected in reasoning mapping play different roles in inquiry learning.

T1  - Using the physiology of normal aging as a capstone integration exercise in a medical physiology course
AN  - 2546648320
AB  - As the Baby Boomer generation reaches old age, there has been a significant increase in the number of older adults needing healthcare over the past decade. The physiology of aging is therefore a highly relevant topic for the preclinical medical curriculum. I describe a new capstone unit on the physiology of aging, placed at the end a medical physiology course, to provide a vehicle for integration of prior learning about physiology of each individual body system. Students were provided with online self-study modules as preparation for a mandatory small group case-based learning activity. A detailed case of an elderly female patient being assessed for fall risk was provided. Students were required to document a "Review of Systems" predicting decreased system functions due to senescence and to prepare a group concept map illustrating how physiologic deficits contributed to fall risk in the patient. Students successfully completed the activity and reported generally good satisfaction with the experience. The activity was judged an effective tool for students to consolidate prior learning and to apply physiology to an important medical topic. The lesson also provided several opportunities for curriculum integration with cell biology, biochemistry, anatomy, and clinical skills components.

T1  - School-STEM Professionals’ Collaboration: a case study on teachers’ conceptions
AN  - 2541584417
AB  - The motivation for the design of this study was to understand the possibility and impact of the involvement of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) professionals on school STEM education. This involved two stages, with the design of a set of authentic STEM inquiry activities firstly and implementation in primary classrooms secondly. Five teachers from a local primary school, who were making their first attempt in implementing STEM learning with students at senior primary levels, participated in this study. The teachers worked collaboratively with an Environmental Scientist with support from the research team to design authentic STEM activities to solve a problem which is currently affecting the school environment. The study used a qualitative approach with teachers’ pre- and post- concept maps, self-reflections and interviews to capture changes in teachers’ STEM conceptions. The findings showed that “School-STEM Professionals’ Collaboration” had a positive impact on teachers’ conceptions of STEM education and STEM professionals.

T1  - The development of a simple solar energy heater as a stem based instructional material for high school students
AN  - 2540792191
AB  - This preliminary research aims to design instructional material for high school students. The research method used in this development is ADDIE (Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation). The developed Instructional Material refers to the NGSS (Next Generation Science Standards)’s first dimension. Our design and development stage includes five parts, namely designing and building the equipment, applying the equipment to measure some physical quantities, data analysis, the effectiveness of teaching and learning, and developing lesson plan for teaching and learning. The result of the development is a comprehensive Simple Solar Energy STEM project lesson plan. This project could discuss various integrated topics, processes, or phenomena such as fusion process in a star, greenhouse effects, electromagnetic waves, alternative energy, thermal physics, and lenses which can be depicted in a concept map. The core competencies, time allocation, assessment, and concept map are incorporated into the lesson plan as part of the instructional material. The designed STEM heater project has discrepancies of 16% and 6.8% compared to advanced tools. These discrepancies are tolerable for educational purposes. The STEM Project is also applicable in every school as it is simple and the material is easy to find.

T1  - Giving Feedback on Peers’ Concept Maps in an Inquiry Learning Context: The Effect of Providing Assessment Criteria
AN  - 2529011494
AB  - Giving and receiving peer feedback is seen as an important vehicle for deep learning. Defining assessment criteria is a first step in giving feedback to peers and can play an important role in feedback providers’ learning. However, there is no consensus about whether it is better to ask students to think about assessment criteria themselves or to provide them with ready-made assessment criteria. The current experimental study aims at answering this question in a secondary school STEM educational context, during a physics lesson in an online inquiry learning environment. As a part of their lesson, participants (n = 93) had to give feedback on two concept maps, and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions—being provided or not being provided with assessment criteria. Students’ post-test scores, the quality of feedback given, and the quality of students’ own concept maps were analyzed to determine if there was an effect of condition on feedback providers’ learning. Results did not reveal an advantage of one condition over the other in terms of learning gains. Possible implications for practice and directions for further research are discussed.

T1  - A Concept Mapping Activity to Enhance Pharmacy Students' Metacognition and Comprehension of Fundamental Disease State Knowledge
AN  - 2542473614
AB  - [...]year pharmacy students in a problem-based learning course were responsible for self-directed learning of foundational knowledge for 14 disease states.

Keywords: metacognition, concept mapping, pharmacy education, active learning INTRODUCTION In the current age of rapid advancement of medical practice, pharmacy students must acquire skillstobecome critical thinkers and self-directed, lifelong learners.

Two studies involving pharmacy students found that high-performing students demonstrate more accurate self-assessment of their abilities compared to low-performing students, and are better able to identify incorrect items on an examination.2,3 A study evaluating pharmacy students' confidence level and willingness to seek help with answering drug-information questions found they were overconfident and less willing to ask for help with unfamiliar topics.4 Pharmacy graduates should be able to examine and reflect on their personal knowledge, skills, and abilities; therefore, it is imperative that pharmacy curricula implement learning strategies using metacognition.

Concept maps are graphical representations depicting concepts related to one another, and are used as an educational technique to improve understanding of course material, integrate didactic and experiential knowledge, and encourage higher-order learning.5 Concept mapping activities have demonstrated improved meta-cognitive accuracy and increased critical-thinking skills in assessments evaluating nurses and pediatric medical residents.6-8 Concept mapping is currently being used in pharmacy curriculums to teach disease states and the Pharmacists' Patient Care Process, as well as for assessment purposes.9-11 Performing concept mapping may improve pharmacy students' metacognition through utilization of judgement of learning12 and reflection.

T1  - The Effects of Digital Concept Cartoons and Digital Concept Maps on Eliminating Middle School Students’ Misconceptions in the Mathematics Course: An Experimental Research
AN  - 2678457612
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of digital concept cartoons and maps in eliminating misconceptions of secondary school students. The research was conducted with 67 students who were studying at three different branches of 7th grade of secondary school. The research was conducted according to semi-experimental design with pre-test, post-test control group, and quantitative and qualitative research methods (mixed pattern) were used together. Accordingly, the mathematics classes in the Study Group I were conducted by the DCC method and the mathematics courses in the Study Group II were conducted by the DCM, and the mathematics courses in the control group were processed by traditional teaching method. In order to determine the students’ misconceptions before and after the experiment, Misconception Test was used which was applied as Pre-test and Post-test. In addition, students’ opinions and observation processes related to the use of DCC and DCM in mathematics class were included in the experimental process. As a result of the data analysis, there was no statistically significant difference between Study Group I, Study Group II and control group when the results of the Misconception test of the control and study groups were compared. In addition, students stated that the use of DCC and DCM in mathematics course have advantages such as making the courses enjoyable, drawing attention, increasing interest in the course, and visualizing the course topics. In the direction of the findings obtained from the research, various suggestions were made to the teachers and researchers about the use of DCC and DCM in secondary school mathematics courses.

T1  - Powering up flipped learning: An online learning environment with a concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy
AN  - 2499836017
AB  - Scholars have suggested that flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinking skills. Problem posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking skills. However, it has been reported as a challenging task for most students. Research evidence has indicated the potential of engaging students in group learning with step‐by‐step hints when conducting problem‐posing activities. Therefore, this study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning. To understand the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, a flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school. Seventy‐five fifth graders from three classes were divided into experimental group A, experimental Group B and a control group. Students in Group A used the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy for flipped learning (CMPP‐FL), students in Group B used the problem‐posing strategy‐based flipped learning, while students in the control group used the conventional flipped learning strategy. The results showed that the CMPP‐FL was effective in terms of improving students' learning performance, especially for students with higher levels of critical thinking tendency.Alternate abstract:Lay DescriptionWhat is already known about this topicFlipped learning enabled teachers to have more class time to engage students in applying knowledge.Scholars have suggested that the value of flipped learning can be enhanced by designing effective in‐class learning activities to improve students' higher order thinkingProblem‐posing has been recognized as such a learning strategy that has great potential for improving students' higher order thinking.What this paper addsThis study proposed a multilevel concept mapping‐based problem‐posing strategy to assist students in completing the problem‐posing tasks in flipped learning.A flipped learning system was developed and adopted in the science class of an elementary school.It was also found that the results showed that the concept map‐guided problem‐posing strategy was effective in terms of improving students' flipped learning performance, especially for those with higher levels of critical thinking tendency.Implications for practice and/or policyEmploying concept maps as a guidance for problem posing is a promising approach.It is worth investigating the impacts of the concept map‐guided problem posing approach on the students with different personal characteristics, such as knowledge levels or motivational levels.It is worth applying the approach to other courses in the future to further explore its effectiveness.

T1  - The Development Learning Activities Using Three Levels of Chemical Representation for Enhance Upper Secondary Students’ Organic Chemistry Concepts
AN  - 2511968945
AB  - The purpose of this study is to develop chemistry learning activities using three levels of chemical representations for enhancing upper secondary students’ organic chemistry concepts. The three levels of chemical representations are an important framework in chemistry education. Many students held misconceptions in organic chemistry because of students’ incapability to connect among the three levels of chemical representations. Development chemistry learning activities using three levels of chemical representations started by analyzing the applications of such a framework in organic chemistry lessons. The teaching strategy would follow the Life-Observation-Notation or LON approach. Chemistry learning activities were developed and received a quality examination by three experts who have experience in teaching chemistry to assess the content validity that arranged the chemistry learning activities according to the content. There are many teaching strategies used in these learning activities, such as concept map, demonstration, analogy, and hands on activities were developed. The learning activities provide abilities to relating the phenomena at a macroscopic level to a microscopic and symbolic level. The learning activities are expected to develop students’ understanding of chemical phenomena and organic chemistry concepts.

T1  - Effects of different concept map activities on chemistry learning
AN  - 2493709190
AB  - There is widespread evidence showing that concept maps are effective for learning. However, little is known about the effects of various concept map activities. We conducted an experiment to examine the comparative effectiveness of three concept map activities: (i) translating a complete map to a paragraph format, (ii) filling in concepts in a partial map, and (iii) filling in labels in a partial map. Undergraduate students enrolled in an introductory general chemistry course were randomly assigned to the three groups. Each concept map depicted the relationships between concepts on the topic of reaction enthalpy. Results showed that the map-translation group significantly outperformed the fill-in-concepts and fill-in-labels groups in conceptual understanding indicated by open-ended questions while there were no significant differences among the three groups in conceptual understanding indicated by multiple-choice questions.

T1  - Static and interactive concept maps for chemistry learning
AN  - 2493709162
AB  - Over 40 years of research, concept maps have shown that they are beneficial for learning. However, much of this research has been conducted in laboratory settings. Although there are a few studies conducted in the classroom, there is little understanding of the instructional efficacy of using different types of concept maps. In a between-subjects design, the present study investigates the effects of learning chemistry in a large undergraduate classroom with three concept mapping activities: static, fill-in-concepts, and fill-in-labels. Students reviewed a static map or completed a fill-in-the-blank concept map. Results show that students studying static concept maps outperformed those who engaged with the fill-in-the-blank concept maps. Further, prior knowledge was found to be a significant predictor of learning performance. Additional findings show that the accuracy of completing partial concept maps mediates the influence of concept map format on learning. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.

T1  - Real-world ethics in palliative care: A systematic review of the ethical challenges reported by specialist palliative care practitioners in their clinical practice
AN  - 2491566097
AB  - Background:  Ethical issues arise daily in the delivery of palliative care. Despite much (largely theoretical) literature, evidence from specialist palliative care practitioners about day-to-day ethical challenges has not previously been synthesised. This evidence is crucial to inform education and adequately support staff.  Aim:  To synthesise the evidence regarding the ethical challenges which specialist palliative care practitioners encounter during clinical practice.  Design:  Systematic review with narrative synthesis (PROSPERO registration CRD42018105365). Quality was dual-assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Tabulation, textural description, concept mapping and thematic synthesis were used to develop and present the narrative.  Data sources:  Seven databases (MEDLINE, Philosopher’s Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched from inception to December 2019 without language limits. Eligible papers reported original research using inductive methods to describe practitioner-reported ethical challenges.  Results:  A total of 8074 records were screened. Thirteen studies from nine countries were included. Challenges were organised into six themes: application of ethical principles; delivering clinical care; working with families; engaging with institutional structures and values; navigating societal values and expectations; philosophy of palliative care. Challenges related to specific scenarios/contexts rather than the application of general ethical principles, and occurred at all levels (bedside, institution, society, policy).  Conclusion:  Palliative care practitioners encounter a broad range of contextual ethical challenges, many of which are not represented in palliative care ethics training resources, for example, navigating institutional policies, resource allocation and inter-professional conflict. Findings have implications for supporting ethical practice and training practitioners. The lack of low- and middle- income country data needs addressing.

T1  - Developing a clinical presentation dental education model and a pilot test
AN  - 2487848772
AB  - IntroductionAccurate clinical decision‐making of dentists should be based on their knowledge and experience. In the past 10 years, interest in competency‐based dentistry education has rapidly increased, but there has been little attention paid to methods of improving dental education competency. The purpose of this study was to develop a clinical presentation education model that provides opportunities for students to practice problem‐solving from the moment they greet the patient so that students can obtain the practical experience of competency‐based education and the effectiveness of this model can be confirmed through pilot test.MethodsThis article is divided two parts: First, developing the clinical presentation dental education model (CPDEM) and Second, a pilot study adopted CPDEM. To confirm the effectiveness of this model, the students' satisfaction, their perception of self‐achievement were analysed.ResultsClinical presentation dental education model has been developed to provide practice‐related education experience and provide linkage between basic science and clinical science. The result of applying this education model to 10 students as a pilot test was shown an overall high satisfaction level. In addition, self‐achievement students’ reported of all intended competencies was higher than for non‐participating students of this model.ConclusionsThis study focuses on practical education centring on clinical presentation. This model could get a meaningful and realistic experiences through the practice using clinical presentation of patients, use their metacognition for organizing and memorizing the patient's case by using concept map. It can be used as a future instructional method to enhance students' competency.

T1  - An innovative pharmacology curriculum for medical students: promoting higher order cognition, learner-centered coaching, and constructive feedback through a social pedagogy framework
AN  - 2531557744
AB  - Background
Ongoing developments in medical education recognize the move to curricula that support self-regulated learning processes, skills of thinking, and the ability to adapt and navigate uncertain situations as much as the knowledge base of learners. Difficulties encountered in pursuing this reform, especially for pharmacology, include the tendency of beginner learners not to ask higher-order questions and the potential incongruency between creating authentic spaces for self-directed learning and providing external expert guidance. We tested the feasibility of developing, implementing, and sustaining an innovative model of social pedagogy as a strategy to address these challenges.
Methods
Constructivism, communities of practice, and networked learning theory were selected as lenses for development of the model. 365 first-year medical students participated between 2014-2018; they were introduced to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics via 15 online modules that each included: learning objectives, a clinical vignette, teaching video, cumulative concept map, and small group wiki assignment. Five-person communities organized around the 15 wiki assignments were a key component where learners answered asynchronous, case-based questions that touched iteratively on Bloom’s cognitive taxonomy levels. The social pedagogy model’s wiki assignments were explored using abductive qualitative data analysis.
Results
Qualitative analysis revealed that learners acquired and applied a conceptual framework for approaching pharmacology as a discipline, and demonstrated adaptive mastery by evaluating and interacting competently with unfamiliar drug information. Learners and faculty acquired habits of self-directed assessment seeking and learner-centered coaching, respectively; specifically, the model taught learners to look outward to peers, faculty, and external sources of information for credible and constructive feedback, and that this feedback could be trusted as a basis to direct performance improvement. 82-94% of learners rated the social pedagogy-based curriculum valuable.
Conclusions
This social pedagogy model is agnostic with regard to pharmacology and type of health professional learner; therefore, we anticipate its benefits to be transferable to other disciplines.

T1  - Through the Stakeholders' Eyes: An Evaluation of a Transnational Biomedical Research Training Program Advancing the Growing Practice of Global Health Education
AN  - 2665129487
AB  - BackgroundInfluenced by Embrace the World, Pitt’s strategic plan for its global vision the University of Pittsburgh (Pitt) has enhanced its involvement in transnational knowledge sharing endeavors over several decades. The School of Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh has been directly involved in a global health education initiative involving transnational biomedical research training and scientific skills development. The program involves hosting young Chinese medical professionals or Visiting Chinese Medical Professionals (VCMP) from Tsinghua School of Life Sciences, Beijing, China who work alongside members of the “laboratory community.”Statement of Dissertation of PracticeThis dissertation of practice is an evaluation of this transnational biomedical research training program. The program evaluation includes the assessment of stakeholder perspectives to identify program strengths, areas for development, opportunities, barriers, and goals. Identifying these areas helps develop an understanding of the responsiveness of the system to this transnational training program.MethodsPersonal interviews and focus groups combined with secondary data analysis of the Methods and Logic in Biomedicine curriculum, exit interview surveys designed and conducted by personnel from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine (UPSOM), and contractual objectives were used to identify global health education practices in this transnational training program. A strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and barriers (SWOB) analysis was conducted. Data was coded using NVivo software.ResultsStudy participant groups’ perspectives align and disconnect in program goals, strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and barriers. Effort, generation of data, and personal development are identified as main themes in how each group defines productivity. The “laboratory community” is identified as a system supporting this transnational training program. Reported as an area for development is the espoused value of diversity and inclusion.ConclusionsThis transnational training program in biomedical research is a special niche within global health education. The system supporting this program at the University of Pittsburgh has shown adaptability to challenges. Outcomes of this global health education program are the development of scientific skills sets and the evolution of a young physician scientist.

T1  - INTERDISCIPLINARY TEACHING OF NERVE CELL ELECTROSTATICS AND ELECTROKINETICS USING INTERACTIVE CONCEPTUAL MAPS
AN  - 2641592339
AB  - In 2020, due to the restrictions imposed by the Covid-19pandemic, the education system passed a fundamental change. Both students and teachers had to acquire new skills in a world with access to a multitude of written or audio-visual information. The role of the teacher in the education process has changed. As his central role diminished, the teacher assumed the position of mentor. This position is reflected in the integration in lessons of modern learning methods that teach the student to use the information he can find from the comfort of his home. The paper presents the neuron, as a cell of the nervous system, an interdisciplinary subject, through interactive concept maps. The conceptual map is realized on two levels, on the first level being presented the nervous system, and on the second level the physical quantities characteristic of the nerve cell membrane and the calculation of their values. The electrostatics and electrokinetics of the nerve cell membrane and its equivalent wiring diagram are presented. By using interactive concept maps, the teacher can present the essential concepts punctually, being necessary to understand them in order to solve new situations in disciplines related to physics. The presentation in Microsoft Office Power Point 365, introduced in the concept map, contains a 3D model of the neuron from its own library of 3D models and has hyperlinks to a video from an online source and to the educational site Mozaweb with interactive 3D content adapted to home learning through maths and information technology.

T1  - What Does Black-body Radiation Mean for Pre-Service Physics Teachers?
AN  - 2638079252
AB  - This study aims to determine pre-service teachers’ conceptual understanding of black-body radiation. Designed as a qualitative study, it was realized by employing a case study, which is one of the descriptive research methods. The study group consists of 18 pre-service teachers enrolled as seniors. An opinion form and a concept map were used as data collection tools. In other words, results were intended to be comparatively examined by using two different qualitative data collection methods. Pre-service teachers’ answers were analysed with the help of answer sculptures. At the end of the study, it was determined that while pre-service teachers generally have the correct conceptual structure, they still have some specific points. It was seen that pre-service teachers have problems with understanding especially the Wien law and electromagnetic radiation taking place in black-body radiation.

T1  - Integrating Sustainable Education into An Ict Curriculum: A Study into the Role Of 'Technology Stewardship' in Achieving Transformative Learning Toward Sustainability in a Saudi Arabian ICT Training Context for Pre-Service Teachers
AN  - 2637955120
AB  - This qualitative study explores Saudi pre-service teachers’ experience of building understandings of sustainability in an ICT context. It aims to enhance transformative learning toward sustainability through integrating aspects of sustainable education into ICT curricula. It details the epistemic approaches adopted in the research, one oriented around 'technological stewardship', and explores evidence of paradigmatic shifts stemming from that approach. Action research, as seen by Kemmis (2010), with some aspiration of participatory action research, was chosen as a methodological framework, because it allows the active and collective engagement of the pre-service teachers into a learning experience, which enables access to practical data. Through the data collection methods used (Padlet, drawing maps, WhatsApp, focus group and interviews), this study brings new insight into the actual learning practices and the development of technology stewardship processes by pre-service teachers, and how they expand knowledge, perception and practices as related to sustainability.The findings of this study contribute to a growing body of knowledge in the field of sustainable education, transformative learning and technology stewardship. It adds more understanding and develops a rich picture of the technology stewarding processes with regard to sustainable education. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of the engagement in a proto-community, and the practicing of technology stewarding, in advancing sustainable education and transformative learning. Through engagement in practices like decision making about relevant resources, negotiating and developing information trajectories, developing relations with others and validating and appreciating different insights, pre-service teachers develop essential skills for sustainable education and transformative learning. These skills include developing learners’ critical thinking, holistic thinking, problem solving skills (knowing), adaptive thinking, integrative thinking (seeing), and collective action skills (doing) (Sterling, 2007). Moreover, the findings suggest that the learners build rich knowledge about sustainability and its relation to technology, and at the same time develop different levels of technology stewarding responsibilities, through gradually engaging in three levels of learning and practice: ‘learning’, ‘leading’, and ‘empowerment’. Eventually, the study suggests a pedagogical framework for designing a transformative learning experience toward sustainability in an ICT context.The above insights might benefit Saudi educational policy makers, revealing possible ways for integrating sustainable education into curricula. Furthermore, it provides practical ways for educators to plan and design a learning experience that could lead to transformative learning toward sustainability. Moreover, it offers a base knowledge for researchers who are interested in studying technology stewardship as a way of enhancing transformative learning toward sustainabilit

T1  - Implementation Of Ssi Concept Mapping As A Dynamic Learning Environment To Enhance Students' Scientific Performance
AN  - 2612823247
AB  - The presented research focuses on verifying the confluent application of concept mapping (CM) and socio-scientific issues (SSI) according to the value-laden and moral dilemma orientation to construct problem-solving performance. This research sets up some perspectives for all 146 participants, including 139 students and 7 experts. All findings reveal that the design of SSICM contexts includes a rebuttal process and incense claim to improve students' argument response (16.4%), to increase content knowledge and illuminate their science learning by argumentations. To develop an assessment tool with high validity and reliability (Cronbach's α > .9) and find positive presentations of all learning attitudes in the SSICM context, learning environment and results will concern the best argumentation process. Students’ interview responses and SWOT analysis of teachers indicate that SSICM's use of argument in the classroom is a real benefit. The research provided a better paradigm of attempts to combine analytical and academic hypotheses to explain literature sources by teachers, researchers, textbook developers, and editors.

T1  - Preparing Datasets of Surface Roughness for Constructing Big Data from the Context of Smart Manufacturing and Cognitive Computing
AN  - 2612753150
AB  - In smart manufacturing, human-cyber-physical systems host digital twins and IoT-based networks. The networks weave manufacturing enablers such as CNC machine tools, robots, CAD/CAM systems, process planning systems, enterprise resource planning systems, and human resources. The twins work as the brains of the enablers; that is, the twins supply the required knowledge and help enablers solve problems autonomously in real-time. Since surface roughness is a major concern of all manufacturing processes, twins to solve surface roughness-relevant problems are needed. The twins must machine-learn the required knowledge from the relevant datasets available in big data. Therefore, preparing surface roughness-relevant datasets to be included in the human-cyber-physical system-friendly big data is a critical issue. However, preparing such datasets is a challenge due to the lack of a steadfast procedure. This study sheds some light on this issue. A state-of-the-art method is proposed to prepare the said datasets for surface roughness, wherein each dataset consists of four segments: semantic annotation, roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system. These segments provide input information for digital twins’ input, modeling, simulation, and validation modules. The semantic annotation segment boils down to a concept map. A human- and machine-readable concept map is thus developed where the information of other segments (roughness model, simulation algorithm, and simulation system) is integrated. The delay map of surface roughness profile heights plays a pivotal role in the proposed dataset preparation method. The successful preparation of datasets of surface roughness underlying milling, turning, grinding, electric discharge machining, and polishing shows the efficacy of the proposed method. The method will be extended to the manufacturing processes in the next phase of this study.

T1  - Creating a Concept Map for ICS Security – A Delphi Study
AN  - 2612527965
AB  - Conference Title: 2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)Conference Start Date:  2021,  Oct.  13 Conference End Date:  2021,  Oct.  16 Conference Location: Lincoln, NE, USAThis Research Full Paper presents the results of a Delphi study. Industrial Control Systems (ICS) is a term used to describe highly integrated and mutually dependent systems made up of a complex network of hundreds of thousands of interconnected control systems. These systems usually incorporate different mass production and distribution elements to accomplish an industrial purpose. These highly integrated and mutually dependent systems have been deployed to manage, monitor, and control industrial infrastructure to provide essential services, such as electricity, energy, chemical, food and beverage, water, gas, oil, and traffic control systems. As these internet-connected systems and technologies continue to grow globally, the risks and threats of ICS cyberattacks' are rapidly increasing. If left susceptible to cyberattacks, any significant stoppage or interruption can cause real-world damages, considerable loss, and undesirable events. ICS security, the process of keeping these systems secure, is becoming a challenging priority for industrial organizations. A recent study conducted by the Center for Strategic International Studies (CSIS) showed that across eight countries of I.T. decisionmakers, 82 % of employers reported a cybersecurity skills shortage, and 71 % believe this talent gap poses direct and observable harm to their organization. A report by (ISC)2 found that there is a vast ICS cybersecurity workforce gap, and the cybersecurity workforce needs to grow 89% to meet industry needs in the United States and 145% to close the skills gap worldwide. The major factor driving the market is the increasing number of complex cyber-attacks on ICS systems, requiring a high demand for trained and skilled professionals in the ICS cybersecurity field. In 2016, a CSIS survey of IT employers found that only 23 % believed education curriculums were fully training students to join the cybersecurity industry. Likewise, in 2018, ISACA found that 61 % of institutes believe that fewer than half of those filling cybersecurity positions were qualified for the job. The current education curriculum lacks essential cybersecurity programs and degrees. It does not provide a strong foundation for building the role-specific knowledge necessary to meet the needs of the cybersecurity workforce. This deficiency needs to be urgently addressed through the creation of multiple, flexible programs in industrial control systems security. One of the first steps in this development is to identify the most critical knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to become proficient in ICS security. This paper reports on a Delphi study designed to identify these foundational concepts and create a concept map based on the findings. This study used the Delphi method to develop the concept map. A selection of 25 experts in ICS security from academia, industry, and government were contacted and asked to outline a list of core knowledge areas. The researchers developed a summary of the experts' opinions. Two more rounds of input and feedback were solicited from the panel of experts. This paper describes the process and the resulting concept map describing the landscape of ICS cybersecurity.

T1  - Assessing Student Perceptions of Emerging Concepts in Power & Energy Systems via Concept Maps: Rubric Development
AN  - 2612523091
AB  - Conference Title: 2021 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)Conference Start Date:  2021,  Oct.  13 Conference End Date:  2021,  Oct.  16 Conference Location: Lincoln, NE, USA[Work in Progress] The grid of the (near-) future is envisioned as an intelligent system consisting of millions of smart devices and interconnected decision-makers that can be monitored, supervised, and controlled in real-time. This emerging paradigm calls for a revamping of the power and energy engineering curriculum, with the goal of developing a future workforce with strong foundational skills in not only traditional power systems topics, but also in renewable energy and distributed resources grid integration and in data analytics. This paper presents the vision and the preliminary work of an ongoing engineering education project aimed at improving students' skill sets in renewable energy-integrated power distribution system analysis with data analytics. The project will develop an integrated research-oriented power engineering curriculum that uses active and situated learning pedagogy. This paper presents the preliminary assessment methodology used by the project team to evaluate the current curriculum's effectiveness in developing students' conceptual knowledge of these emerging concepts. Concept maps are used and a scoring rubric is being developed. The data gathered through this graded concept maps will guide the project team in their curriculum redesign.

T1  - Knowledge sharing, knowledge transfer and SMEs: evolution, antecedents, outcomes and directions
TT  - Knowledge sharing in SMEs
AN  - 2605005465
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to systematically synthesize the extant literature of knowledge sharing (KS) and knowledge transfer (KT) in the small and medium enterprise (SME) context and to contribute with predictions of emerging themes.Design/methodology/approachApplied is a systematic literature review using three bibliometric techniques: (1) textual analysis for keywords and abstracts to identify the research hotspots, (2) co-citation analysis of references to identify the evolution of KS and KT in SME and (3) bibliographic coupling analysis of documents to synthesize antecedents and outcomes.FindingsA conceptual map emerges from the review to reveal the antecedents of KS and KT at the individual, group and organizational levels. The analysis shows the strategic importance of KS and KT for the SME context. Specific findings include: (1) KS and KT are involved in enhancing SMEs strategic focus for human resources, including organizational learning, customer relations, creativity, higher profit and positive effects on operational processes and decision-making. (2) Innovation, trust and performance are identified as central human factors linked to KS and KT in SMEs. (3) Human resource (HR) management research could contribute to KS and KT in the SME domain by exploring KS- and KT-based practices, linking the emergence of innovation and innovative behaviors to these practices, leading to a better understanding of strategies that enable the long-term storage and retrieval of tacit and explicit knowledge as organizational memory in the SME context.Originality/valueThis paper is one of the first to systematically review KS and KT in SMEs and propose a concept map. The research adds value to the growing literature of KS and KT and exposes the need for more specific activities to support SME managers, as well as HR managers, who need to facilitate KS and KT in SMEs.

T1  - Analysis of Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, and Behavioral Intention on Extended Scratch-Build Concept Mapping Tool
AN  - 2604948536
AB  - Conference Title: 2021 7th International Conference on Electrical, Electronics and Information Engineering (ICEEIE)Conference Start Date:  2021,  Oct.  2 Conference End Date:  2021,  Oct.  2 Conference Location: Malang, IndonesiaThis study investigated the extent of students’ perceptions of the Extended Scratch-Build learning tool. ESB is a computer-based extension concept mapping application that allows learners to expand their previous concept map in promoting improved meaningful learning. ESB approach has been shown to enhance students’ understanding and knowledge structure positively. However, there is no information on the extent of learners’ intentions in using the ESB tool. Users’ perceptions are considered essential in determining their intention to adopt the system development in the future. This study involved the Technology Acceptance Model to determine the students’ degree of acceptance using concept mapping. The perceived ease-of-use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention questionnaires were used to investigate users’ intentions further. The results showed that the learners perceived positive responses on ESB as ease of use and a valuable learning tool. The students agree that the ESB approach is a promising tool and suitable for use in future learning.

T1  - Comparative Investigation of Full and Focused Network Feedback on Students’ Knowledge Structure and Learning
AN  - 2604884220
AB  - STEM education has an important role in students’ learning, and one of the challenges in learning STEM is students’ conceptual understanding during the learning process. For example, in many engineering courses, the instructors often employ methods which are predominantly limited to “chalk and talk”. This type of hands-off teaching method discourages students’ engagement with the topic; therefore, many students’ understandings of it are at the surface level. Summary writing is an effective approach for helping learners to integrate and understand the STEM content. In this investigation, the tool Graphical Interface of Knowledge Structure (GIKS) asked students to write a summary essay of lesson content. Next/ Following this, GIKS generated a network map as feedback of the term-term association, which allowed students to reflect on their essay content and structure. This also allowed the instructor to review the essay results simultaneously.In this investigation, knowledge structure referred to an individual’s cognitive structure. In the prior pertinent literature, it was also referred to as individual’s structural knowledge, conceptual network, conceptual representation, conceptual structure, knowledge organization, and semantic structure. Network maps provided a way to understand knowledge structure and could show the transition of knowledge from novice to expert.Network feedback could serve as a form of structural feedback, a form of feedback that directly intended to alter the structure of term-term associations. This research focused on two types of network feedback: Full network feedback and Focused network feedback. Full network feedback referred to the ordinary view of domain content, while in contrast the Focused network feedback allowed a closer look at a few key sub-branches or specific areas of this content. Ultimately, the Full network map provided the broader understanding of the content knowledge, whereas the Focused network map emphasized the most central and important information. Thus, the difference between Full network map and Focused network map depended on whether the Focus located on the overall domain or a key sub-branch of the content.The research questions in this dissertation included:• Which network feedback leads to a better novice/student’s learning performance?• Will students use and value this approach?• What is the influence of students’ achievement goal orientation in this structural feedback approach?In order to investigate and respond to the research questions, the learning performance of students in an engineering course using GIKS, who were randomly assigned to receive either Full network feedback or Focused network feedback, were compared. The control group was Full network feedback and the experimental group was the Focused network feedback. Participants’ knowledge structure was measured at three times. Findings indicated that Focused network feedback relative to Full network feedback had a significant impact on individual’s knowledge structure (KS) improvement in 45 days after the treatment.

T1  - The Effect of a Combined Curriculum According to the Concept Map and Hierarchical Learning in Learning the Skill of Stabbing for the Novice Hookah Players
AN  - 2604880319
AB  - Some, through lines or arrows, write on them the word linking to clarify the relationship between one concept and another, as it highlights its role in finding the appropriate method that shows the interconnected chains between concepts in the educational curriculum, which facilitates the absorption of the learned skill and achieve effective learning, especially if there is a process of linking between concepts and learning The hierarchy, which depends on various patterns that work on the occurrence of learning according to what the learner sees and in the desired manner for the learned skill, and thus access to a good educational product, especially through which the learner can solve the problems he faces, hence the importance of research in using the concept map strategy and hierarchical learning to acquire knowledge from both sides.

(12) of them are a main research sample, for each group (6) players, and (2) of them are a sample for the exploratory experiment, after which the method of measuring the skill of the challenge was determined, then the exploratory experiment, and then the tribal tests that took place on Monday at three o'clock in the afternoon on 1/2 /2021 in the fencing hall in Al-Hussein neighborhood, and from then on, the integrated educational curriculum was applied according to (the map of concepts and hierarchical learning) for the members of the experimental group in order to facilitate learning the skill of stabbing for players of the blind weapon, and the implementation period of the educational curriculum took (4) weeks with two educational units per week.

Researchers and specialists have given a lot of attention to this for the sake of advancement, development and progress in this field, which was positively reflected on the performance of coaches or teachers in their selection The strategies that are important and appropriate to the level of learning so that there is a kind of continuity in the duties given to learners and their appearance at an appropriate level in the level of sports activities and this is consistent with what is presented by the map of concepts that play an important role in organizing and controlling the teaching and learning process as they are graphic forms that link concepts to each other through lines or Arrows on which the word linking is written to clarify the relationship between one concept and another Where it highlights its role in finding the appropriate method that shows the interconnected chains between the concepts in the educational curriculum, which facilitates the absorption of the learned skill and the achievement of effective learning, especially if there is a process of linking between concepts and hierarchical learning that depends on various patterns that work on the occurrence of learning according to what the learner sees and how The desired ability of the learned skill and thus access to a good educational outcome, especially through which the learner can solve the problems facing him, and this increases when the visual-spatial perception of the player develops as it increases the comprehension and understanding and improves learning for the player's performance through the use of visual forms and images that depict the most important main ideas that need ability Highly visual in order to understand many concepts well, and for this reason fencing is one of the games that has witnessed rapid development in recent years and increased interest in it and has become influenced by experts and specialists and finding methods to teach the skillful performance of learners and develop their level through the use of various scientific methods that help to learn and master basic skills and accuracy Its performance and development, hence the importance of research in strategic use A map of concepts and hierarchical learning to acquire knowledge from the theoretical and practical sides, especially if the visual perception plays a role in the educational curriculum.

In order to keep pace with modernization and development in the sports fields, especially in terms of learning and breaking with tradition, and after reviewing the scientific sources, the researcher decided to go into choosing a map of concepts and merging them with hierarchical learning in a case that may be the first in the level of educational curricula and linking them to what is consistent through learning skills The basic principle of dueling for beginners is that there are hierarchical and sequential steps that lead to the application of the cognitive and applied aspects of the educational curriculum, which may sometimes depend on the visual-spatial perception, in the belief of the researcher that these variables will facilitate the learning process in a way that exceeds the usual level of learning.

AB  - IntroductionMechanisms explain how implementation strategies work. Implementation research requires careful operationalisation and empirical study of the causal pathway(s) by which strategies effect change, and factors that may amplify or weaken their effects. Understanding mechanisms is critically important to replicate findings, learn from negative studies or adapt an implementation strategy developed in one setting to another. Without understanding implementation mechanisms, it is difficult to design strategies to produce expected effects across contexts, which may have disproportionate effects on settings in which priority populations receive care. This manuscript outlines the protocol for an Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality-funded initiative to: (1) establish priorities for an agenda to guide research on implementation mechanisms in health and public health, and (2) disseminate the agenda to research, policy and practice audiences.Methods and analysisA network of scientific experts will convene in ‘Deep Dive’ meetings across 3 years. A research agenda will be generated through analysis and synthesis of information from six sources: (1) systematic reviews, (2) network members’ approaches to studying mechanisms, (3) new proposals presented in implementation proposal feedback sessions, (4) working group sessions conducted in a leading implementation research training institute, (5) breakout sessions at the Society for Implementation Research Collaboration’s (SIRC) 2019 conference and (6) SIRC conference abstracts. Two members will extract mechanism-relevant text segments from each data source and a third member will generate statements as an input for concept mapping. Concept mapping will generate unique clusters of challenges, and the network will engage in a nominal group process to identify priorities for the research agenda.Ethics and disseminationThis initiative will yield an actionable research agenda to guide research to identify and test mechanisms of change for implementation strategies. The agenda will be disseminated via multiple channels to solicit feedback and promote rigorous research on implementation mechanisms.

T1  - Identifying Occupational Therapy Research Priorities in Trinidad and Tobago: A Group Concept Mapping Study
AN  - 2585198685
AB  - In Trinidad and Tobago, occupational therapy is an emerging profession with limitations in the number of practitioners and the scope of practice. With the development of a new Master of Science Occupational Therapy programme in the country, the profession is continuously growing. There has been an increased demand for culturally relevant research to build the occupational therapy evidence base locally. However, the narrow range of occupational therapy literature in the country makes it difficult to highlight research gaps and decipher what research areas should be prioritised to best impact occupational therapy practice at present. This group concept mapping study is aimed at identifying priority areas for occupational therapy research in Trinidad and Tobago from the perspectives of occupational therapy students and practitioners. Participants brainstormed and contributed specific research ideas they would like to see developed in the country. Individually, participants sorted these ideas into themes and rated each idea based on perceived importance and feasibility. Using the GroupWisdom™ software, multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were applied to the sort data to create idea clusters within a concept map. Rating values were analysed to determine priority research themes within the concept map. The resulting concept map illustrated seven research priorities: Contextualising Practitioner Development, The Realities of Emerging OT Practice, Localising Mental Health OT, Occupation and Participation of Children and Youth, School-based OT in the Local Context, OT with Special Populations, and OT Contributions to the Public Health Sector. These findings represent the research needs of the occupational therapy profession in Trinidad and Tobago and will help to focus future researchers’ efforts to expand the local evidence base.

T1  - The Pre-Production Plans on Designing a Promotional Video for Project-based Language Learning: A Case Study with Smart Toilets
AN  - 2583618872
AB  - This pilot project undertook an effort to understand how the pre-production plans on designing a promotional video in a project-based language learning classroom could be unveiled with undergraduate EFL computer science junior-level students. The central idea of the project was to explore the efficacy of digital storytelling as a method for developing professional communication skills in English. The specific case study chosen for the project was on intelligent toilets, and the pre-production movie design activities as assignments were designed in the syllabus as a community outreach effort in trying to promote awareness about intelligent toilets as a commercial product, and the necessity and benefits of intelligent toilets for consumers who might not be aware of it’s reach. Assignments such as designing storyline and screenplay, print and video poster design, visual storyline with concept mapping, storyboarding and conference presentation design and delivery not only focused on understanding how students handle different design and analysis software, and technical documentation in a group setting, but also the extent to which they could successfully work with their team collaboratively, and in the process improve professional communication. The project could not explicitly and objectively measure the learning outcomes for professional communication, but it helped us explore the extent to which the group assignments requiring substantial group communication and coordination could be worked through successfully, and students’ self-reported impression about the course materials, in general, and the working dynamics of the group. It’s an established fact that successful group communication and coordination, and such group-based technical communication activities require multiple interactions, iterations and repeated and prolonged exposure. However, within the limited scope of this pilot project, the researchers could identify moderately successful efforts being made both for the assignments and in terms of the team effort.

T1  - Concept Mapping Strategy: An Effective Tool for Improving Administration Nursing Students' Knowledge and Attitude
AN  - 2582236706
AB  - Abstract Background: Concept mapping, a learning strategy used to understand key concepts and relationships between concepts, has been suggested as a method to plan and evaluate nursing care.

Materials and Methods:a true - experimental design was conducted in faculty of nursingZagazig University, three tools were used for data collection namely; pre/posttest knowledge questionnaire, rubric for assessing concept map, and attitude assessment tool Results:Before implementing the training the highest percentages of nursing students had poor level of knowledge (92.5%), while all nursing students had good level of knowledge after implementing training.

Keywords: Concept mapping; Nursing administration; students; attitude Introduction: Rapid scientific and technological advanced in the health care mean that nurses need to keep learning and engage in professional education so that they can continue to provide safe and quality care.

The possible explanation for these results may be due to that the faculty of nursing is predominantly attended by females and nursing considered a feminist career and entering of male to the faculties of nursing is recent in Egypt in general and in Zagazig university in particular, as well as the system of study in the faculty require attendance the theoretical lectures and clinical training in the hospital and prepare assignments this put students under overload and stress and have no time to marry and take a family responsibility.

T1  - Toward Interdisciplinary Learning: Development and Validation of an Assessment for Interdisciplinary Understanding of Global Carbon Cycling
AN  - 2582193019
AB  - This study developed and validated an assessment that measures interdisciplinary understanding using the topic of carbon cycling, the Interdisciplinary Science Assessment for Carbon Cycling (ISACC). This work was motivated by the need to assess interdisciplinary understanding, defined as the ability to solve problems requiring knowledge and skills from multiple disciplines. Levels of a construct map for interdisciplinary understanding were generated and refined in the construct-modeling design process (Wilson 2005). Key concepts in carbon cycling to be assessed were determined based on experts’ concept maps and analysis of the Next Generation Science Standards. The final version of the ISACC includes 11 multiple-choice (MC) items and eight constructed-response (CR) items covering nine key concepts. Of these 19 items, six are single-disciplinary items and 13 are interdisciplinary items. Four hundred fifty-four students in grades 9–16 were recruited and administered the ISACC. For the CR items, scoring rubrics were developed and used by a group of evaluators to code student responses. Two item response theory models, a two-parameter logistic model and a generalized partial credit model, provided evidence of the construct validity of the items. All items reflected unidimensionality and local independence and showed moderate internal consistency (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.782). All except one were a good fit to the models. The findings suggest that the ISACC is a promising tool to assess interdisciplinary understanding of carbon cycling. Future directions include research into test fairness across gender and ethnic/racial groups and further development to cover typical high school students’ knowledge more thoroughly.

T1  - Molecular Orbital Theory—Teaching a Difficult Chemistry Topic Using a CSCL Approach in a First-Year University Course
AN  - 2576395500
AB  - Collaboration is regarded as one of the core competences of the 21st century when it comes to complex problem solving. In response to high dropout rates among STEM students, we developed a digital-collaborative intervention on a difficult topic, MO theory, for first-year chemistry students. First, students work independently in a Digital Learning Environment (DLE). Afterwards, they collaborate in small groups and create Concept Maps on MO theory. We evaluate this intervention through knowledge tests, tests of attractiveness, cognitive load, and usability during the DLE and concept mapping process, as well as audio and screen recordings during the collaborative group processes. This paper presents the detailed study design together with results from a first study in January 2021, focusing on the practicability of the intervention and students’ feedback. Overall, each small group succeeded in creating a Concept Map. Students rated all phases of the intervention as attractive, with high usability and low cognitive load, although the interactive videos scored better for attractiveness and usability than the concept mapping process. On that basis, first adjustments for a second cycle of the intervention, which will be conducted in January 2022, were derived.

T1  - Effects of Strategy Training and Elaboration vs. Retrieval Settings on Learning of Cell Biology Using Concept Mapping
AN  - 2576392956
AB  - Concept mapping (CM) can be an effective strategy to facilitate understanding-based learning of complex and abstract scientific content. In our study, we tried to answer two questions that have not yet been clarified: (1) How effective is CM if the learners do not have the textual learning material available when constructing their concept maps (retrieval setting) in contrast to when the material is available (elaboration setting)? (2) Do potential effects of the two settings depend on the intensity of a previous CM strategy training? To this end, we established a quasi-experimental four-group plan and collected data of N = 93 undergraduate students. The participants received either a detailed CM strategy training or just a short introduction and were then asked to apply CM in a retrieval or elaboration setting. The quality of constructed concept maps and content-related learning success were assessed to determine potential group differences. Overall, our results show a significantly positive but setting-independent effect of the CM strategy training on methodical CM skills. However, the different setting conditions differed neither regarding concept map quality nor content-related learning success, implying that CM in retrieval settings could be as effective as in elaboration settings.

T1  - Fostering Learning with Incremental Scaffolds During Chemical Experimentation: A Study on Junior High School Students Working in Peer-Groups
AN  - 2565460506
AB  - Scaffolds are considered to be a promising method of supporting learning. In this study, we investigated the learning efficacy of scaffolds in an inquiry-based learning scenario. Three tasks posed a question/problem to facilitate inquiry-based learning, and scaffolds offered the answer/solution in multiple steps (so-called incremental scaffolds). The use of the scaffolds was voluntary and students’ learning efficacy was compared with a traditional teaching approach. A total of N = 105 seventh graders participated in the quasi-experimental study. Incremental scaffolds were available to the students in the treatment group. Students in the control group received the same question/problem but could only ask the teacher about the answer/solution. Concept maps were used at pre- and posttest to assess conceptual knowledge acquisition. In-line with our hypothesis, results show that students in the treatment group outperformed controls concerning conceptual knowledge acquisition. Regarding the number of misconceptions students used, there were no differences between the groups. Our study indicates that incremental scaffolds are an appropriate method to provide students with the exact help they really need. Based on our findings, we offer practical implications and recommendations for future research.

T1  - Comprehension-Oriented Learning of Cell Biology: Do Different Training Conditions Affect Students’ Learning Success Differentially?
AN  - 2565140238
AB  - Concept Mapping (CM) is a learning strategy to organize and understand complex relationships, which are particularly characteristic of the natural science subjects. Previous research has already shown that constructing concept maps can promote students’ meaningful learning in terms of deeper knowledge and its more flexible use. While researchers generally agree that students need to practice using CM successfully for learning, key parameters of effective CM training (e.g., content, structure, and duration) remain controversial. This desideratum is taken up by our study, in which three different training approaches were evaluated: a CM training with scaffolding and feedback vs. a CM training without additional elements vs. a non-CM control training. In a quasi-experimental design, we assessed the learning outcome of N = 73 university students who each had participated in one of the trainings before. Our results suggest that an extensive CM training with scaffolding and feedback is most appropriate to promote both CM competence and acquisition of knowledge. From an educational perspective, it would therefore be advisable to accept the time-consuming process of intensive practice of CM in order to enable students to adequately use of the strategy and thus facilitate meaningful learning in terms of achieving sustained learning success.

T1  - Are Cross-Border Classes Feasible for Students to Collaborate in the Analysis of Energy Efficiency Strategies for Socioeconomic Development While Keeping CO2 Concentration Controlled?
AN  - 2562212908
AB  - Education is critical for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 concentration, but collaboration between countries is also critical. It is a global problem in which we cannot isolate ourselves. Our students must learn to collaborate in seeking solutions together with others from other countries. Thus, the research question of this study is whether interactive cross-border science classes with energy experiments are feasible and can increase awareness of energy efficiency among middle school students. We designed and tested an interactive cross-border class between Chilean and Peruvian eighth-grade classes. The classes were synchronously connected and all students did experiments and answered open-ended questions on an online platform. Some of the questions were designed to check conceptual understanding whereas others asked for suggestions of how to develop their economies while keeping CO2 air concentration at acceptable levels. In real time, the teacher reviewed the students’ written answers and the concept maps that were automatically generated based on their responses. Students peer-reviewed their classmates’ suggestions. This is part of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education project on energy efficiency using APEC databases. We found high levels of student engagement, where students discussed not only the cross-cutting nature of energy, but also its relation to socioeconomic development and CO2 emissions, and the need to work together to improve energy efficiency. In conclusion, interactive cross-border science classes are a feasible educational alternative, with potential as a scalable public policy strategy for improving awareness of energy efficiency among the population.

T1  - Looking Deeper: Using the Mobile Microscope to Support Young Children’s Scientific Inquiries
AN  - 2562196608
AB  - This study adopted a quasi-experimental design with the support of qualitative information to investigate the impact of the mobile microscope on students’ science learning outcomes in a laboratory setting. The duration of the educational experiment was 5 weeks. Research participants comprised 56 third graders from two different classes at a public elementary school in Taiwan. Two classes with an equal number of students formed the experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group employed mobile microscopes to support their scientific inquiries, whereas students in the control group used only tablet computers to facilitate their science learning. A standardized test was developed to measure students’ basic understanding of botany. Additionally, semi-structured concept mapping was employed as an alternative non-standardized test to evaluate students’ natural science learning. The quantitative findings indicated a significant instructional effect in the students’ concept mapping but not in the standardized test. The qualitative results revealed that mobile microscopes might motivate students to actively engage in knowledge discussion and sharing during plant observation.

T1  - Exploration of Middle School Students’ Ideas of Fine Dust Issues Using Issue Concept Maps
AN  - 2560076326
AB  - This study introduces issue concept maps (IC map) as an instructional tool for exploring students’ idea about socio-scientific issues (SSI). By visualizing students’ ideas in two dimensions, context and occurrence, IC maps represent what kinds of ideas students have on the issues, and how their ideas change and connect. In the study, we implemented a SSI program on fine dust for 77 seventh graders and used IC maps to investigate how their ideas changed after the program. Students collaboratively constructed IC maps in groups before and after the program. Results show that the number of ideas written on IC maps significantly increased after the program from 92 to 254 ideas, indicating that the program contributed to enhancing students’ awareness about the issues in terms of its causes, effects, and countermeasures at various context levels. Students also presented a greater variety of types of connections among their ideas after the program.

T1  - Development of a behavioral taxonomy of agility in the workplace
TT  - Workplace Agility
AN  - 2559999830
AB  - PurposeThe concept of workforce agility has become increasingly popular in recent years. However, defining it has sparked much discussion and ambiguity. Recognizing this ambiguity, this paper aims to inductively develop a behavioral taxonomy of workforce agility.Design/methodology/approachThe authors interviewed 36 experts in the field of agility and used concept mapping and the critical incident technique to create a behavioral taxonomy.FindingsThe authors identified a behavioral taxonomy consisting of ten dimensions: (1) accepting changes, (2) decision making, (3) creating transparency, (4) collaboration, (5) reflection, (6) user centricity, (7) iteration, (8) testing, (9) self-organization, and (10) learning.Research limitations/implicationsThe authors’ research contributes to the literature in that it offers an inductively developed behavioral taxonomy of workforce agility with ten dimensions. It further adds to the literature by tying the notion of workforce agility to the performance literature.Practical implicationsThe authors’ results suggest that it might be beneficial for companies to take all workforce agility dimensions into account when creating an agile culture, starting agile projects, integrating agility into hiring decisions or evaluating employee performance.Originality/valueThis paper uses an inductive approach to define workforce agility as a set of behavioral dimensions, integrating the scientific as well as the practitioner literature on agility.

T1  - Investigating the Factors that Influence Technology Acceptance of an Educational Game Integrating Mixed Reality and Concept Maps
AN  - 2557991386
AB  - Conference Title: 2021 International Conference on Advanced Learning Technologies (ICALT)Conference Start Date:  2021,  July  12 Conference End Date:  2021,  July  15 Conference Location: Tartu, EstoniaWith the rapid development of mobile learning technologies as well as relevant hardware and software platforms, there is a bright prospect for mixed reality (MR) applying in the field of education. However, appropriate knowledge navigation and concept arrangement methods are urgent to diminish students’ cognitive load in the virtual learning environment. In this preliminary study, concept maps were selected as scaffolding tools to help students navigate through the MR learning space, and an educational game prototype named MMRCM integrating MR and concept maps was developed to investigate students’ technology acceptance about it. Considering the novelty of this new type of MR application, an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was constructed with the MR game design elements and the concept map usefulness as external factors. A middle school physics experiment using MMRCM was conducted to help students learn the abstract concepts of friction. The evaluation results showed that the model’s external factors have significant correlations with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The findings indicated explicit intention to use MMRCM, which implied that MR gaming and concept maps could be integrated as an effective instructional tool in science education.

AN  - 2531701611
AB  - An experimental study to assess the effectiveness of concept mapping on depression among students in selected colleges of Gandhinagar. The main objective of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of concept mapping on depression among students in selected colleges of Gandhinagar. The 'General system model' adopted from Ludwg Von Breatalanaffy was used as the conceptual framework. A quantitative approach with true experimental study design was used to achieve the objective of the study. The samples consisted of 60 students of selected colleges of Gandhinagar. The samples are divided into two groups, 30 students in control group and 30 students in experimental group. The control group was treated using traditional method and the experimental group was treated using traditional method and concept mapping both. The simple random sampling technique was used to collect the sample. A structured questionnaire was used to assess the knowledge of student of selected colleges and the tool was found reliable. In the present study it is seen that control group improved in scores when it was given traditional method and experimental group who was given concept mapping along with traditional method improved more in scores as compared to control group.

T1  - Exploring Students’ Science-Related Career Awareness Changes through Concept Maps
AN  - 2531399060
AB  - The current article addressed middle school (13–15 years old) students’ science-related career awareness (SCA) and aimed to determine the effects of a longitudinal intervention, which focused on integrating career education into science teaching, using a pre- and post-test design. During the intervention, five teaching/learning modules (TLMs) were implemented in science lessons that enabled students to experience being (1) an electrical engineer, (2) a food technologist, (3) a forensic scientist or a civil engineer, (4) a team member of oil catastrophe simulation clean-up team, and (5) a customs’ officer. Concept mapping was used to determine the changes in students’ SCA. The suitability of this technique was validated through semi-structured focus group interviews. It was found that concept mapping enabled detection of progression in the intervention students’ SCA among both boys and girls. The interviews provided valuable input on how students interpreted science-related occupations and relevant competences, when constructing their concept maps. An implication from this study was that SCA supportive teaching and learning modules or other similar teaching methods needed to be an inherent part of science teaching to support students making well informed decisions, either towards or away from science-related careers.

T1  - An innovative pharmacology curriculum for medical students: promoting higher order cognition, learner-centered coaching, and constructive feedback through a social pedagogy framework
AN  - 2491104881
AB  - Background 
Ongoing developments in medical education recognize the move to curricula that support self-regulated learning processes, skills of thinking, and the ability to adapt and navigate uncertain situations as much as the knowledge base of learners. Difficulties encountered in pursuing this reform, especially for pharmacology, include the tendency of beginner learners not to ask higher-order questions and the potential incongruency between creating authentic spaces for self-directed learning and providing external expert guidance. We tested the feasibility of developing, implementing, and sustaining an innovative model of social pedagogy as a strategy to address these challenges.
 Methods 
Constructivism, communities of practice, and networked learning theory were selected as lenses for development of the model. Three hundred sixty-five first-year medical students participated between 2014 and 2018; they were introduced to pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics via 15 online modules that each included: learning objectives, a clinical vignette, teaching video, cumulative concept map, and small group wiki assignment. Five-person communities organized around the 15 wiki assignments were a key component where learners answered asynchronous, case-based questions that touched iteratively on Bloom’s cognitive taxonomy levels. The social pedagogy model’s wiki assignments were explored using abductive qualitative data analysis.
 Results 
Qualitative analysis revealed that learners acquired and applied a conceptual framework for approaching pharmacology as a discipline, and demonstrated adaptive mastery by evaluating and interacting competently with unfamiliar drug information. Learners and faculty acquired habits of self-directed assessment seeking and learner-centered coaching, respectively; specifically, the model taught learners to look outward to peers, faculty, and external sources of information for credible and constructive feedback, and that this feedback could be trusted as a basis to direct performance improvement. 82–94% of learners rated the social pedagogy-based curriculum valuable.
 Conclusions 
This social pedagogy model is agnostic with regard to pharmacology and type of health professional learner; therefore, we anticipate its benefits to be transferable to other disciplines.

T1  - Are Cross-Border Classes Feasible for Students to Collaborate in the Analysis of Energy Efficiency Strategies for Socioeconomic Development While Keeping CO2 Concentration Controlled?
AN  - 2486919842
AB  - Education is critical for improving energy efficiency and reducing CO2 concentration, but collaboration between countries is also critical. It is a global problem in which we cannot isolate ourselves. Our students must learn to collaborate in seeking solutions together with others from other countries. Thus, the research question of this study is whether interactive cross-border science classes with energy experiments are feasible and can increase awareness of energy efficiency among middle school students. We designed and tested an interactive cross-border class between Chilean and Peruvian eighth-grade classes. The classes were synchronously connected and all students did experiments and answered open-ended questions on an online platform. Some of the questions were designed to check conceptual understanding whereas others asked for suggestions of how to develop their economies while keeping CO2 air concentration at acceptable levels. In real time, the teacher reviewed the students’ written answers and the concept maps that were automatically generated based on their responses. Students peer-reviewed their classmates’ suggestions. This is part of an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Science Technology Engineering Mathematics (STEM) education project on energy efficiency using APEC databases. We found high levels of student engagement, where students discussed not only the cross-cutting nature of energy, but also its relation to socioeconomic development and CO2 emissions, and the need to work together to improve energy efficiency. In conclusion, interactive cross-border science classes are a feasible educational alternative, with potential as a scalable public policy strategy for improving awareness of energy efficiency among the population.

T1  - Facilitating knowledge construction in mobile learning contexts: A bi‐directional peer‐assessment approach
AN  - 2484696716
AB  - With the advancements in technology networks, mobile learning has been extensively applied in teaching contexts, enabling closer interaction between students and authentic environments. Previous studies have indicated that, when learning in real‐world contexts, students need to interact with real learning targets and peers as well as the digital learning content; thus, effective learning strategies or tools are generally required for helping them organize knowledge and for promoting peer interactions. As a result, the present study developed a bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system, which not only engages students in assessing peers’ concept maps, but also encourages them to evaluate or respond to peers’ ratings and comments. To explore the effectiveness of this learning system, the study conducted an experiment in elementary science classes. A total of 101 fifth graders from four classes were recruited to participate in the study. Two classes were assigned to the experimental group and two to the control group. The experimental group adopted the bi‐directional peer‐assessment approach, while the control group adopted the conventional peer assessment approach for concept mapping. The results reveal that the bi‐directional peer‐assessment‐based concept mapping system can not only increase students’ learning achievement and the completeness of their concept mapping, but can also enhance their critical thinking tendency and the feedback quality of their peer assessment.

T1  - Constructing online concept maps in CMap Cloud collaboratively: Connecting pathways in case scenarios
AN  - 2480152096
AB  - Learning metabolic pathways is vital for understanding biochemical processes and all of their implications for life. Their learning in the virtual environment is complex and generative learning strategies, such as the construction of online conceptual maps, can help in this process. This article presents a proposal for the collaborative construction of virtual concept maps on metabolism by students in the CMap Cloud browser application (free). A sequence of steps is suggested, which include online group brainstorming and discussions, peer assessment, and teachers feedback. This proposal is flexible and can be adapted to the didactic and technological reality of each teacher.

T1  - Quality of concept maps is affected by map building strategies
AN  - 2480151844
AB  - Concept‐maps are widely used to assess students' conceptual understanding in different subject areas. Conventionally, it is mostly built maps which are assessed. In this study, we explore if “concept‐mapping” could be used as a case for constructive alignment of both the process and the outcome of learning. Specifically, we have studied how a simple measure of looking at the order in which concept map elements‐concepts (cards, C), links (arrows, A), and linking phrases (phrases, P)‐ are placed on the working space reveals information about the quality of the final generated map. We report findings from analysis of the concept‐mapping process in two separate groups of university students (N = 38 (18 + 20)) who were asked, individually, to build concept maps related to two separate concepts in biology and chemistry respectively. We found that, across both groups, students consistently followed the same order of element placement that they began with and found significant differences in the quality of eventual maps resulting from students' map building strategies. Our results suggest that the quality of students' concept maps depends considerably on the strategy used to build it, and point to the supplementary role that the physical working space of the concept‐mapping exercise offers to students' own working memory as a possible explanation for these quality differences.

T1  - Building Science Language: Principles for integrating science and vocabulary instruction
AN  - 2501216393
AB  - Science is a great time to focus on language development in the elementary classroom. Participation in science requires that students use language to present claims, engage in argumentation, and partake in science and engineering process skills. Over the years, Nelson and Allen have noted the importance of vocabulary in their students' ability to participate in the language of science. Research also notes a clear link between children's early experiences, including exposure to rich vocabulary, and academic success. They decided to examine ways to effectively integrate vocabulary instruction in science and set out to develop a list of core principles to help guide this cross-curricular integration. Their goal was to support student vocabulary development, which in turn would support the development of science language and the ability of all students to fully participate in science.

T1  - Using primary literature on SARS‐CoV‐2 to promote student learning about evolution
AN  - 2462588030
AB  - The ongoing COVID‐19 pandemic caused by SARS‐CoV‐2 has caused widespread deaths, illnesses, and societal disruption. I describe here how I pivoted a discussion‐based senior biology capstone course to include a multiweek module surrounding one primary literature paper on the evolution of SARS‐CoV‐2 and the subsequent scientific discourse about the paper. Using a gradual reveal of the paper following the CREATE method (consider, read, elucidate, and think of the next experiment), I challenged students to learn new evolutionary principles and critically analyze the data surrounding the evolution and transmission of SARS‐CoV‐2 presented in the paper. I also provide general advice for implementing this module in future courses.

T1  - Using concept maps to understand mechanical physics concepts in high school students
AN  - 2571215769
AB  - The work presents a didactic proposal on the use of concept maps, for the understanding of mechanical physics. A didactic intervention based on Ausubel’s theory was applied with the following activities: design, implementation and application of workshops based on real physical situations, where the elaboration of concept maps is the central axis, under the quantitative paradigm of interpretative level and action research method. The informants were 43 tenth grade students from a public educational institution located in the Department of Norte de Santander, Colombia. The results obtained showed that the use of concept maps as a didactic intervention favoured the significant learning of classical mechanics concepts. It was evident that the participating students achieved reflective analysis about the resolution of problems about the concepts of mechanics.

T1  - Course Achievement Evaluation Using Concept Map in Traditional Learning
AN  - 2570906979
AB  - Concept map (CM) has been proved to be pretty efficient in learning assessment. Existing CM-based learning assessment methods tend to compare a CM delivered by a student against a standard version or expert version. This manuscript employs CM as a technique to assess students’ learning performance from the results of a bunch of traditional performance assessments. The experimental results show a more comprehensive result for interpreting students’ learning performance and provide some indications of the gap between teaching and learning for future teaching reforms.

T1  - The Safe Care Framework™: A practical tool for critical thinking
AN  - 2454416550
AB  - Safe, effective and ethical clinical decision-making in nursing depends on critical thinking, yet there is no consensus on the educational strategies that are most effective in developing and refining this foundational skill. A qualitative inquiry among graduating Bachelor of Science in Nursing students sought to determine whether one such educational strategy, an operationalized critical thinking framework, would assist nursing students to better understand acute care patients' complex profiles. The Safe Care Framework™, consisting of the ‘Concept Map Template’ and the ‘Priority Setting Tool Template’, was developed using a constructivist pedagogical approach. The framework illustrates and operationalizes the systematic critical thinking processes that expert nurses use to provide safe, comprehensive care. Thematic analysis of qualitative survey results revealed the following three main themes; (1) greater organization and understanding of patient data; (2) guiding of assessments and priorities of care; (3) better communication with others, and several subthemes. Thus, the Safe Care Framework™ may be a practical operational tool that can support novice nurses in developing critical thinking skills. This framework adds to the literature on innovative pedagogy for nurse educators.

T1  - Fostering successful and sustainable collaborations to advance implementation science: the adolescent HIV prevention and treatment implementation science alliance
AN  - 2438842447
AB  - IntroductionHIV continues to devastate the adolescent population in sub‐Saharan Africa (SSA). The complex array of interpersonal, social, structural and system‐level obstacles specific to adolescents have slowed progress in prevention and treatment of HIV in this population. The field of implementation science holds promise for addressing these challenges.DiscussionThere is growing consensus that enhanced interactions between researchers and users of scientific evidence are important and necessary to tackle enduring barriers to implementation. In 2017, the Fogarty International Center launched the Adolescent HIV Prevention and Treatment Implementation Science Alliance (AHISA) to promote communication and catalyse collaboration among implementation scientists and implementers to enhance the cross‐fertilization of insights as research advances and the implementation environment evolves. This network has identified key implementation science questions for adolescent HIV, assessed how members’ research is addressing them, and is currently conducting a concept mapping exercise to more systematically identify implementation research priorities. In addition, AHSA pinpointed common challenges to addressing these questions and discussed their collective capacity to conduct implementation science using the shared learning approach of the network. Specifically, AHISA addresses challenges related to capacity building, developing mentorship, engaging stakeholders, and involving adolescents through support for training efforts and funding region‐/country‐specific networks that respond to local issues and increase implementation science capacity across SSA.ConclusionsInnovative platforms, like AHISA, that foster collaborations between implementation science researchers, policymakers and community participants to prioritizes research needs and identify and address implementation challenges can speed the translation of effective HIV interventions to benefit adolescent health.

T1  - Investigating the validity of web-enabled mechanistic case diagramming scores to assess students’ integration of foundational and clinical sciences
AN  - 2423335393
AB  - As medical schools have changed their curricula to address foundational and clinical sciences in a more integrated fashion, teaching methods such as concept mapping have been incorporated in small group learning settings. Methods that can assess students’ ability to apply such integrated knowledge are not as developed, however. The purpose of this project was to assess the validity of scores on a focused version of concept maps called mechanistic case diagrams (MCDs), which are hypothesized to enhance existing tools for assessing integrated knowledge that supports clinical reasoning. The data were from the medical school graduating class of 2018 (N = 136 students). In 2014–2015 we implemented a total of 16 case diagrams in case analysis groups within the Mechanisms of Health and Disease (MOHD) strand of the pre-clinical curriculum. These cases were based on topics being taught during the lectures and small group sessions for MOHD. We created an overall score across all 16 cases for each student. We then correlated these scores with performance in the preclinical curriculum [as assessed by overall performance in MOHD integrated foundational basic science courses and overall performance in the Clinical and Professional Skills (CAPS) courses], and standardized licensing exam scores [United States Medical Licensing Exam (USMLE)] Step 1 (following core clerkships) and Step 2 Clinical Knowledge (at the beginning of the fourth year of medical school). MCD scores correlated with students’ overall basic science scores (r = .46, p = .0002) and their overall performance in Clinical and Professional Skills courses (r = .49, p < .0001). In addition, they correlated significantly with standardized exam measures, including USMLE Step 1 (r = .33, p ≤ .0001), and USMLE Step 2 CK (r = .39, p < .0001). These results provide preliminary validity evidence that MCDs may be useful in identifying students who have difficulty in integrating foundational and clinical sciences.

T1  - Concept Maps for Structuring Instruction and as a Potential Assessment Tool in a Large Introductory Science Course
AN  - 2502214710
AB  - Concept maps make connections between ideas apparent, and thus would seem ideally suited to demonstrate learning. Yet, they are not widely used by instructors, particularly in large university classes. In this paper we review the strengths and rationale behind concept maps and provide examples we have used to structure content for one of our introductory courses. A rubric that focuses on propositions was used to grade student-created concept maps on a final exam administered to 293 students. These grades are compared to those of multiple-choice questions, short answers, and an essay on the same exam. We find poor correlation between concept maps and the other instruments, and stronger correlations between short answers and multiple choice, as well as between short-answer content grades and essay writing grades. We speculate that concept maps may be less influenced by student language skills and short-term memory than written answers, and that concept maps should be used as an alternative assessment of higher order thinking skills.

T1  - Using Remap RT (Reading – Concept Mapping – Reciprocal Teaching) Learning Model to Improve Low- Ability Students' Achievement in Biology
TT  - Uporaba učnega modela Remap RT (branje - zaznavanje konceptov - vzajemno poučevanje) za izboljšanje úspešnosti dijakov z nizkimi dosežki v biologiji

AB  - The main aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the Remap RT (Reading - Concept Mapping - Reciprocal Teaching) learning model on low-ability students' achievement in biology. This quasi-experimental research made use of a pre-test-post-test non-equivalent control group design. The population of this research was 125 tenth-grade students from the Natural Science classes aged around 16 years old. Four classes were randomly selected as the samples, and they were divided into two groups: two classes belonged to the high ability classes, and the other two were categorised into the low ability groups. The students' achievement was measured using an essay test. The results of the test were analysed using ANCOVA. The findings indicated that 1) students who learned using Remap RT had better academic achievement in biology than students who learned using a conventional method; 2) students with high academic ability had better academic achievement than students with low academic achievement; and 3) low-ability students who learned using Remap RT and high-ability students who learned using a conventional method had equal academic achievement. The results of the research suggest that Remap RT was effective in improving lowability students' achievement in biology.Alternate abstract:Glavni cilj raziskave je bil preučiti učinke učnega modela Remap RT (branje - oblikovanje konceptov - vzajemno poučevanje) na uspehe dijakov z nizkimi dosežki v biologiji. Ta kvazieksperimentalna raziskava je uporabila zasnovo s predpreskusom in popreskusom iz neekvivalentne kontrolne skupine. V raziskavi je sodelovalo 125 dijakov desetega razreda iz naravoslovnih razredov, starih približno 16 let. Štirje razredi so bili naključno izbrani v vzorec in razdeljeni v dve skupini: dva razreda sta sodila v skupino z visokimi dosežki, dva pa v skupino z nizkimi dosežki. Dosežki dijakov so bili testirani z vprašanjem esejskega tipa. Rezultati testa so bili analizirani z uporabo ANCOVA. Ugotovitve so pokazale, da so: 1) dijaki, ki so se učili z uporabo Remap RT, dosegli boljše akademske dosežke v biologiji kot tisti, ki so se učili s konvencionalno metodo; 2) dijaki z visokimi dosežki na akademskem področju uspešnejši kot dijaki z nizkimi dosežki; 3) dijaki z nizkimi dosežki, ki so se učili z uporabo Remap RT, in dijaki z visokimi dosežki, ki so se učili s konvencionalno metodo, imeli enake akademske dosežke. Izsledki raziskave kažejo, da je bil model Remap RT učinkovit pri izboljšanju dosežkov dijakov z nizkimi dosežki v biologiji.

T1  - Gaming in Nursing Education: Recent Trends and Future Paths
AN  - 2418009138
AB  - Background:
Game-based learning has attracted much attention in education in recent years due to its ability to increase student motivation and engagement in learning. This study reviewed the literature to answer the research questions: What learning outcomes have been linked to games in nursing education? What are potential gaps in the field's knowledge regarding games in nursing education?
Method:
A systematic literature search was completed in CINAHL and Google Scholar from 2009–2019 with the keywords of games, gaming, and nursing education.
Results:
A total of 49 papers were identified; of these, 34 were excluded, and 15 empirical studies were evaluated. The majority reported beneficial learning outcomes, such as increased knowledge, higher test scores, and positive student comments. Several methodological weaknesses were noted, such as small sample sizes, convenience samples, and lack of control groups or randomization.
Conclusion:
Games have the potential to prepare new nurses for improved clinical decision making. More robust research methodologies are needed to confirm best practices for educators. [J Nurs Educ. 2020;59(7):375–381.]

T1  - Increase the hierarchy concept map score through the modification in the 2nd stage of problem-based learning
AN  - 2570352257
AB  - The research aimed to calculate the increase of student’s hierarchy concept map (CM) scores through the modification of problem analysis and learning issue (2nd stage of problem-based learning (PBL)) using question instructional techniques. The type of research is classroom action. Research subjects were 36 X grade students. Research procedures: planning, action, observation, and reflection. Research data is the percentage of hierarchy CM score which is calculated based on the Expert CM score according to the material in each cycle. Data validity is done by confirming the percentage of hierarchy CM score with the result of interviews and documentation of the learning process in each cycle. The analysis techniques use reduction, presentation, and drawing a conclusion. The results show that the average increase in hierarchy percentage scores from pre-cycles to cycle I was 25% and cycle I to II was 38%. The number of students who experienced an increase in percentage hierarchy scores from pre-cycle to cycle I was 83% and cycle I to II by 90%, thus the modification of instructional techniques in problem analysis and learning issues PBL increased the students’ CM hierarchy score.

T1  - The profile changes in pedagogical content knowledge of pre-service biology teachers based on the concept maps
AN  - 2570351790
AB  - Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) is the teacher’s expertise gained since becoming a student. There are changes in PCK for prospective teacher students during lecture and changes can be seen based on the concept map. This study aims to analyze the changing profile of prospective PCK teachers based on concept maps. This study was conducted for biology education students at one of the private universities in West Java during the 2017/2018 school year. Participants are 6 people. Participants are asked to make a speciation concept map during evolution, micro teaching and PPL. Concept maps were analyzed using qualitative descriptive analysis. The results show changes in the concept map that includes changes in the form of concept maps from simple to complex, increasingly meaningful and easily understood as propositions, and only important concepts emerge. Based on this, PCK changes with increasing education and training experience of prospective teachers.

T1  - Concept map and problem-based learning
AN  - 2570350744
AB  - The research aims to calculate the increase of student’s Concept Map (CM) scores through the implementation of Problem-Based Learning (PBL). The research is a classroom action. Research procedures include planning, observation, implementation, and reflection. The subjects were 34 X grade students. The data were collected by observation, assessment, interviews, and documentation. CM scores were calculated as a percentage based on expert CM. The research data consisted of the percentage of students’ CM scores, performance assessment, the implementation of PBL syntax, interviews, and documentation of the learning process. The validity test used data triangulation. The analysis techniques are through reduction, data presentation, and drawing conclusions. The results show that the percentage of CM scores in the pre-cycle, cycle I, and cycle II, respectively have a range of values of 4.62-20.80%; 11.56-24.25%; and 12.14-30.86% with an average increase in the first cycle is 10.96%, and the second cycle is 4.06%. The increase in the average percentage of CM score is supported by the linear increase in the average components of H, P, B, and E, thus the application of PBL is able to increase the percentage of CM scores based on the linear increase in the average components of H, P, B, and E.

T1  - Using a Concept Map With RECALL to Increase the Comprehension of Science Texts for Children With Autism
AN  - 2401627511
AB  - Learning science is important for students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as knowledge of science allows students to understand their natural world, and science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education is increasingly emphasized in schools. Reading to learn science is, therefore, a vital skill in today’s schools for all students. Using a single-case reversal design, this study evaluated the effectiveness of Reading to Engage Children with Autism in Language and Literacy (RECALL; a shared reading intervention) combined with a concept map on the ability of young children with ASD to answer comprehension questions from science text. Two 5-year-old boys with ASD participated in this study. Results indicated that RECALL combined with a concept map was effective in increasing participants’ correct responding to comprehension questions from science text. Implications for intervention and research are discussed.

T1  - Application of Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory in teaching/learning medical biochemistry and molecular biology
AN  - 2407368290
AB  - “Didn't understand or not fully understand” is the most common situation that students experience when they learn medical biochemistry and molecular biology (MBMB). Therefore, the primary task of teaching MBMB is to help students overcome the difficulties in “conceptual understanding.” The core of the solution to these problems lies in the acquisition and application of cognitive skills. The key to applying Ausubel cognitive assimilation theory (A's CAT) is to expand the knowledge capacity of students’ cognitive structure through the purposeful “production” and employment of advanced organizers, with which students can replace “rote learning” with “meaningful learning” and ultimately develop an interest in MBMB courses. The results showed that the application of A's CAT did not only encourage the students to use cognitive skills to learn and understand MBMB knowledge and overcome the barrier to learning that results from the characteristics of the MBMB course, but also expanded and deepened the MBMB course contents. As a branch of learning theory, A's CAT provides practical methods for the several hypotheses of learning theory. Among these, the advanced organizer strategy realizes the organization and reorganization of new knowledge; the progressive differentiation strategy reduces the difficulty of complex and abstract knowledge; the implementation of the advanced organizer strategy and integrative reconciliation strategy forms the concept map. Taken together, the application of A's CAT includes cognitive strategy and metacognitive strategy when the cognitive process is conducted in a meaningful way. More importantly, application of A's CAT guides students to participate in active learning and builds “scaffolding” for the teaching/learning MBMB of student‐centered goals.

T1  - Analyzing the structure of basic quantum knowledge for instruction
AN  - 2401217670
AB  - In order to support students in the development of expertise in quantum mechanics, we asked which concepts and structures can act as organizing principles of non-relativistic theory. The research question has been addressed in a multi-step process based on the analysis of categorization studies, on a content analysis of a sample of undergraduate textbooks, and on the results of existing research on learning difficulties. The answer consists of seven concept maps, intended as models of the organizing principles of quantum knowledge needed to account for the results of measurement and time evolution. By means of these instruments, it is possible to visualize and explore the different facets of the interplay between the vector structure of the quantum states and the operator structure of the observables, and to highlight the educational significance of the relations between observables. The maps can be used by instructors as a support for helping students build a well-organized knowledge structure and by researchers as a basis for the design of investigations into student understanding. While this framework may be adapted to different approaches and interpretive stances, it provides indications in favor of a spin-first approach over a waves-first one.

T1  - Lifelong learning and the structure of professionals' thinking, on the example of case conceptualisation
AN  - 2401072072
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this study was to investigate the relationship between the elements of psychotherapists’ informal education and features of concept maps reflecting the properties of thinking structure.Design/methodology/approachTo study the structure of professional thinking, a complex diagnostic task (computer-aided conceptual mapping task) was used. The diagnostic task consisted of categorising the client’s statements, presenting relations between the categories and concept maps accounting for problems reported by the client and contributing factors and links between them.FindingsThe obtained results showed that self-education, through participation in scientific conferences and attending training courses, was significantly associated with the number of perceived causal relationships between categories and the number of perceived reciprocal links between conceptual categories.Originality/valueThis research show factors which may contribute to more reliable case conceptualisation in psychotherapy. The method used to measure integrative complexity was original.

T1  - Effectiveness of analytical thinking–based module to improve students’ learning outcomes using concept map
AN  - 2569825527
AB  - The effectiveness of 21st century learning emphasizes higher order thinking skills, one of which is analytical thinking. The analytical thinking–based module used includes indicators based on the integration of analytical-thinking aspects and Concept Map components. This study aimed to measure improvement in student learning outcomes using Concept Map through an analytical thinking-based module. The research method used was quasi-experimental with a field test design in the form of a pretest-posttest non-equivalent control group design. Participants were 66 students divided into control class using conventional modules and experimental class using analytical thinking–based modules. The calculation of students’ Concept Map scores is based on the Concept Map experts. The data were analyzed using the Ancova test. The effectiveness results showed: 1) the average score of the Concept Map of the experimental class (81.39%) was higher than the control class (47.89%), 2) the average score of the Concept Map component in the experimental class was higher than the control class, but the cross-link score obtained the lowest score. Concept Map is a powerful tool for educating new knowledge and supporting learning outcomes because has a positive effect on improving students’ learning outcomes and assessment of long-life learning in the teaching and learning process.

T1  - Investigating grade-12 students’ cognitive structures about the atomic structure: a content analysis of student concept maps
AN  - 2419503551
AB  - There is a close relationship between chemistry and physics in the context of atomic structure, which is usually covered in both courses at the secondary-school level. However, little emphasis has been put on determining whether the students developed correct understanding of the quantum structure when they studied it in both the courses. The purpose of this study was to reveal – by using the concept mapping tool – the cognitive structures used by twelfth-grade students to understand atomic structure. One hundred forty-five students from three secondary schools in Ankara, Turkey participated in the study. The qualitative content analysis technique was employed to analyse concepts, levels of connection, and linking phrases in students’ concept maps drawn for the atom. The analysis results revealed that the students had a limited understanding of the quantum structure of the atom, even after studying the topic in chemistry and physics courses. They relied on classical ideas to understand atomic structure. The results suggest that concepts related to atomic structure should be appropriately used not only within a particular subject (e.g. physics) but also across the two subjects to help students understand the scientifically correct atomic structure. Further, several other implications for secondary-school science teaching are discussed.

T1  - Implementing Alternative Assessment Strategies in Chemistry Amidst COVID-19: Tensions and Reflections
AN  - 2847845944
AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic in the first quarter of 2020 resulted in the worldwide disruption of teaching and learning in main stream schools and in institutes of higher learning. Singapore was not spared. With the closure of schools in early April, it was imminent that the delivery and assessment of our freshman general chemistry course must be overhauled for the new semester. While the delivery of Home-based Learning (HBL) was a challenge for all educators, it was a mammoth roadblock for chemistry courses because of laboratory classes. Besides being thrusted to learn and use new technology tools for online lessons, instructors also had to quickly explore and design alternative assessments to substitute in-person written examinations and tests. This paper documents the struggles that played out in the decision to implement concept map assessments and “split-half” laboratory classes for safe distancing. Although these interventions are not novel, we confronted tensions as we sought to address academic integrity, administrative guidelines, and our own inadequacy particularly in concept map assessments. In light of positive and negative feedback from both staff and students, lessons were drawn to enhance future implementation and for further research.

T1  - Analysis of Teaching Techniques and Scheme of Work in Teaching Chemistry in Rwandan Secondary Schools
AN  - 2733856031
AB  - This study aims at determining the effect of the pedagogical technique most frequently used while implementing the competency-based curriculum (CBC) in teaching chemistry in senior two (S2) classes (age range 14-16) and the teachers’ alignment with the scheme of work. It was conducted in 10 selected Rwandan secondary schools using a teacher survey, teacher interviews and the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) in the period from 27 May to 8 July 2019. The result of the analysis reveals that teaching chemistry using group work-related techniques that engage more learners does not have any relationship to teachers moving slowly compared to the scheme of work of S2 chemistry. Therefore, this study recommends more support for teachers to use active learning techniques in teaching chemistry in S2 for the effective implementation of the CBC.

T1  - Effectiveness of Concept Mapping Based Teaching Methods on Grade Eight Students’ Conceptual Understanding of Photosynthesis at Ewket Fana Primary School, Bahir Dar, Ethiopia
AN  - 2733851824
AB  - Concept mapping helps learners to understand complex ideas. However, studies confirming that statement are scarce. A quasi-experimental and Design-based approaches were applied to understand the effectiveness of concept mapping based teaching method on grade eight students’ conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. Two sections of grade eight consisting of 103 students were selected randomly. Pretest results were used to assign students as experimental and control groups and treated with concept mapping and lecture methods, respectively. The post-test results of the two study groups revealed a statistically significant difference indicated that students’ treated with concept mapping method exhibited better conceptual understanding on the concept of photosynthesis than those treated with lecture method. This study suggests that science teachers should apply concept mapping method to teach science concepts systematically. The use of concept mapping method in science classes can help students to better understand the important concepts.

T1  - Improved Concept Map-Based Teaching to Promote a Holistic Earth System View
AN  - 2548516603
AB  - Like some other countries, seldom being sometimes addressed in classes, the Earth system approach is not emphasized enough in Portugal, nor is the interconnection between the geosphere, hydrosphere, atmosphere, and biosphere. To evaluate the Earth system holistic view of a group of 8th grade (13–15 years old) Portuguese students from a public school of the north of Portugal, an improved conceptual map-based to approach Earth system was investigated. After learning about concept mapping, students were asked to collaborate in the production of four conceptual maps regarding each one of the geochemical and biogeochemical cycles, further combining these maps in a common one. Through teamwork-based task, each group was asked to establish relations between the cycles, integrated into each one of the four Earth subsystems. The final combined maps demonstrated that, in the first phase, students had some difficulties in completing the pre-designed improved maps, being more evident in the rock cycle. Contrarily, the food chain cycle revealed fewer mistakes and more appropriate terms were added. In the second phase, the students exhibited difficulties in relating the cycles to the four subsystems and the remaining cycles, drawing many arrows without any kind of connecting words. Nevertheless, in general, students have realized how to build an improved concept map but do not possess a holistic view of the Earth system.

T1  - Aligning implementation and user-centered design strategies to enhance the impact of health services: results from a concept mapping study
AN  - 2546845045
AB  - Background
Innovative approaches are needed to maximize fit between the characteristics of evidence-based practices (EBPs), implementation strategies that support EBP use, and contexts in which EBPs are implemented. Standard approaches to implementation offer few ways to address such issues of fit. We characterized the potential for collaboration with experts from a relevant complementary approach, user-centered design (UCD), to increase successful implementation.
Method
Using purposive and snowball sampling, we recruited 56 experts in implementation (n = 34) or UCD (n = 22). Participants had 5+ years of professional experience (M = 10.31), worked across many settings (e.g., healthcare, education, human services), and were mostly female (59%) and white (73%). Each participant completed a web-based concept mapping structured conceptualization task. They sorted strategies from established compilations for implementation (36 strategies) and UCD (30 strategies) into distinct clusters, then rated the importance and feasibility of each strategy.
Results
We used multidimensional scaling techniques to examine patterns in the sorting of strategies. Based on conceptual clarity and fit with established implementation frameworks, we selected a final set of 10 clusters (i.e., groups of strategies), with five implementation-only clusters, two UCD-only clusters, and three trans-discipline clusters. The highest-priority activities (i.e., above-average importance and feasibility) were the trans-discipline clusters plus facilitate change and monitor change. Implementation and UCD experts sorted strategies into similar clusters, but each gave higher importance and feasibility ratings to strategies/clusters from their own discipline.
Conclusions
In this concept mapping study, experts in implementation and UCD had perspectives that both converged (e.g., trans-discipline clusters, which were all rated as high-priority) and diverged (e.g., in importance/feasibility ratings). The results provide a shared understanding of the alignment between implementation science and UCD, which can increase the impact and sustainability of EBP implementation efforts. Implications for improved collaboration among implementation and UCD experts are discussed.

T1  - Measuring Characteristics of Explanations with Element Maps
AN  - 2535137039
AB  - What are the structural characteristics of written scientific explanations that make them good? This is often difficult to measure. One approach to describing and analyzing structures is to employ network theory. With this research, we aim to describe the elementary structure of written explanations, their qualities, and the differences between those made by experts and students. We do this by converting written explanations into networks called element maps and measure their characteristics: size, the ratio of diameter to size, and betweenness centrality. Our results indicate that experts give longer explanations with more intertwinement, organized around a few central key elements. Students’ explanations vary widely in size, are less intertwined, and often lack a focus around key elements. We have successfully identified and quantified the characteristics that can be a starting point for guiding students towards generating expert-like written explanations.

T1  - Concept Mapping in the Age of Deleuze: Fresh Perspectives and New Challenges
AN  - 2535136667
AB  - This conceptual paper offers a reconsideration of the application of Novakian concept mapping to higher education research by putting to work the Deleuzian concept of the rhizome. We ask: what does thinking with Deleuze’s concepts offer researchers interested in concept mapping, and what conceptual, and terminological, obstacles might be created through such a reconceptualization? We have focused on the rhizomatic principles of mapping and tracing in the context of concept mapping. We contend that Deleuze offers a fresh line of flight with the potential to deterritorialise the discourse surrounding concept mapping, thus widening its applicability and increasing its accessibility to researchers who do not necessarily share the same arborescent concept mapping heritage: with its roots in science education. Exploring the overlap between rhizomatics and concept mapping also allows for the reappraisal and blurring of the boundary between structural and post-structural discourses—breaking down an unproductive binary in the literature.

T1  - STEM Graduate Students’ Systems Thinking, Modeling and Scientific Understanding—The Case of Food Production
AN  - 2534076607
AB  - Featured ApplicationModel-Based Systems Engineering is an edX Professional Certificate Program comprised of two five-week courses that teach principles and applications of model-based systems engineering using Object-Process Methodology—OPM ISO 19450.AbstractModeling and systems thinking skills, as well as scientific understanding, are necessary for comprehending complex, food-related processes. The aim of this research was to evaluate the effect of food-related learning units on graduate students’ systems thinking and modeling skills, as well as on their understanding of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) issues. In this research, six STEM experts constructed a conceptual model of the codfish tracking process using Object-Process Methodology. Next, 15 STEM graduate students, who are prospective teachers, participated in a graduate course, which includes four online units on food production processes based on their respective models. Research tools included an expert focus group, student assignments, and questionnaires. Modeling and scientific understanding rubrics were adapted and validated for analysis of the assignments. We found a significant difference in the scores of systems thinking and modeling skills between students with modeling background and those without. Based of students’ feedback along the course, learning in context of food and sustainability also contributed to developing these skills. The contribution is the combination of food production and conceptual models for developing STEM teachers’ systems thinking and modeling skills, and their scientific understanding of food processes and sustainability issues.

T1  - Statistical Analysis based on SPSS and Empirical Research on Curriculum Ideology and Politics Implementation in Professional Basic Courses: Digital Communication Course as an Example
AN  - 2522917149
AB  - Conference Title: 2020 International Conference on Information Science and Education (ICISE-IE)Conference Start Date:  2020,  Dec.  4 Conference End Date:  2020,  Dec.  6 Conference Location: Sanya, ChinaCurriculum ideology and politics refers to a concept of comprehensive education which contains the ideological and political education contents in various professional courses and general education courses. It can construct a pattern of all-members-participation, entire-process and all-courses education, and regard the moral education as the fundamental task of education. As an important part of talent training, professional basic courses also carry the important historical mission of ideological and political education. With the help of SPSS (Statistical Product and Service Solutions) software, statistical analysis of the current situation of curriculum ideology and politics implementation is fist done based on CNKI database. Then, this paper points out the main problems faced in professional basic courses with some typical cases analysis. To take the Digital Communication course as an empirical example, we put forward some strategies and the suggestions to carry out curriculum ideology and politics in professional basic courses. Specifically, it consists of five aspects, including improving the teachers’ ideological consciousness and literacy, formulating the implementation plan and teaching content, mining the education elements of ideology and politics, exploring the coherence point of ideological elements and subject knowledge, and innovating the teaching methods. Using case analysis method, empirical results based on concept map show that the statistical analysis approach used in this paper is effective and universal.

T1  - Dynamic Feedback as Automated Scaffolding to Support Learners and Teachers in Guided Authentic Scientific Inquiry Settings
AN  - 2512689433
AB  - Guided authentic scientific inquiry activities can give students a clear picture of the nature of science and how its fields operate in practice, but such activities are difficult to do well. Too much structure negates the benefit of open-ended activities and student-led investigation, while too little can result in frustration or unproductive floundering. The inclusion of scaffolds for students as well as teachers in such activities is necessary for their successful implementation. Virtual environments can facilitate open-ended inquiry activities by having built-in scaffolds, such as feedback that reacts dynamically to the actions of learners in real time. However, sparse experimental research exists on how formative feedback can best be deployed to students in open-ended immersive environments compared to more constrained tutoring systems or games. Additionally, these tools and curricula must include support for teachers in the design and implementation process if they are to be used in complex classroom settings. Cutting-edge techniques at the forefront of the educational data mining field are being developed for analyzing student actions in such settings, and interest in these techniques is steadily growing. This dissertation documents a pilot implementation of formative feedback tools embedded in the open-ended virtual world of EcoXPT, an experiential curriculum for learning ecosystems science and scientific inquiry. The efficacy of various types of feedback and methods of deployment to both students and teachers are explored, and student outcomes are compared with data from prior baseline EcoXPT implementations. Compared to students in baseline versions of EcoXPT, groups with access to these feedback tools had larger scientific epistemology gains, when controlling for other factors, and made more complete concept maps. Meaningful sequences of logged actions were identified that correlate positively with outcome measures, and overall trends in feature usage between teachers in the sample were described. Student feedback on the utility of the new feedback features is analyzed, and themes from teacher interviews are described to explore how they used the teacher-facing tools as well as how they saw students reacting to the additional tools.

T1  - Ontological Approach to the Development and Accreditation of the Educational Programs for the Training of IT Specialists of Ukraine
AN  - 2480866943
AB  - Conference Title: 2020 IEEE 15th International Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies (CSIT)Conference Start Date:  2020,  Sept.  23 Conference End Date:  2020,  Sept.  26 Conference Location: Zbarazh, UkraineThe article discusses the concept of knowledge management, which can be used as a methodological basis for the development of new educational programs. The ontology of the educational program is built based on the content of the educational program for the subject area "Computer Science" of the bachelor's educational level. A formal model of the domain ontology is given. It is shown that the structure of ontologies is a conceptualized representation of the subject area, similar to the structure of a concept map, which is a successful method of meaningful learning. To build the ontology of accreditation of the educational program, domains of the discipline; educational program; institution domain; and accreditation domain are considered. The developed ontology can improve Educational Program development management and ensure successful accreditation

T1  - Concept Maps as Sites of Rhetorical Invention: Teaching the Creative Act of Synthesis as a Cognitive Process
AN  - 2478562444
AB  - Synthesis is one of the most cognitively demanding practices novice writers must undertake, and research demonstrates that first-year students’ synthesis writing practices result in more knowledge telling rather than knowledge creation and transforming. Pedagogies used to teach synthesis often focus on developing text-building strategies but lack explicit instruction on the more cognitively demanding conceptualizing behavior. To explore alternative pedagogies and heuristics, this study looks beyond composition scholarship to incorporate studies in neuroeducation and rhetoric to define synthesis as an ongoing, generative act of cognitive invention, effectively shifting pedagogical focus from text-centered product to student-centered cognitive processes that inform development of synthesized texts (a product). The methods were designed to explore any effects a visual intervention might have on developing student conceptual awareness and reflective practice over time, and whether that transferred into a final researched essay as knowledge transforming.This small-scale exploratory study applies a mixed-methods, design-based methodology to a semester-long intervention in first-year writing classrooms using digital concept maps (DCMAPs) as an ongoing, student-designed space of visualized concept construction. A Control group applied traditional reading-to-write text-based synthesis instruction and practice, while the Intervention group used DCMAPs to enact a prolonged, visualized and reflective practice of active construction of associations, relationships, and structural knowledge building. The DCMAP platform affordances positioned students as knowledge designers enacting creative/constructive processes, an approach based on neuroscience research on patterning and visualization. Intervention data includes reflective journals, narrated mapping process reflections, digital concept map images and construction processes, and a final researched essay that required synthesis of source ideas. Because of the exploratory nature of the study, results are not framed as cause-effect but as correlational possibilities that suggest inventional acts of visually creating connections and labeling them using rhetorically-based associational concepts lead to generative learning behaviors. Results suggest a number of possibilities for future iterations and research, as well as implications for our field’s approach to the teaching of synthesis.

T1  - Sustainable Change in a Teaching Career: A Self-Study of an Evolving Music Educator’s Journey
AN  - 2476149018
AB  - The purpose of the study is to examine how professional growth is sustained over time through exploring a teacher’s narrative of personal and professional growth. The central question of this dissertation is: What creates sustainable and continuous positive professional change and growth in a teacher’s professional life? In this study, I discuss my journey towards understanding my practice while teaching a collegiate course and the implications of my journey for continual professional and personal growth. I used self-study methods to interrogate the personal, professional, and contextual experiences that shaped my thinking about teaching, learning, and my practice. The process of reflection was prompted by various data sources, including journal entries, storytelling, memory work, an experience matrix, concept-mapping, and education-related life histories. This self-study also includes action research projects that I conducted while teaching a college course over seven semesters. Data for action research projects included student reflective writing, observations of their learning, video recordings of group project meetings, and student value-creation stories.Through reflection on how my personal, professional, and contextual knowledge of teaching developed, I examine how the values I held, the inquiries I undertook, and the communities in which I engaged affected my learning about teaching and shaped both my continuing professional development and who I am becoming as a teacher. Values that emerged in my teaching practice included: creating a student-friendly learning atmosphere, building a learning community, and being a reflective learner. Change agency functioned as a teacher lens and impacted student learning. I also analyzed patterns between my instructional plans, actions, and learning experiences in multiple professional communities. Professional and personal development relied not only on formal learning but was also promoted by informal learning opportunities and a personal learning process. Findings suggest that teachers’ attempts to engage with external resources and awareness of their personal orientations as internal resources appear essential for sustainable change in teaching practice. Teacher professional growth requires exercising positive personal qualities, such as confidence, compassion, and courage, as well as resilience as an educator and a lifelong learner. Teacher reflection and self-study play a pivotal role in enabling teachers to sustain professional growth.

T1  - Grammar Instruction with UML
AN  - 2468753708
AB  - Conference Title: 2020 IEEE Frontiers in Education Conference (FIE)Conference Start Date:  2020,  Oct.  21 Conference End Date:  2020,  Oct.  24 Conference Location: UppsalaInnovative Practice Work in Progress Paper. Grammar is often taught explicitly in the course of foreign language instruction despite potential misgivings about the details of effectiveness. Different approaches rest on different conceptual and pedagogical rationales, which in turn rely on different forms of conceptual and empirical research. We seek to extend a COOL Informatics approach to grammar instruction in foreign language teaching. COOL Informatics is the acronym for Cooperative and Computer Science supported Open Learning and adopts a neurodidactic approach to teaching in general, in which processes of deduction and generalisation are supported by computational methods of storing, representing and explaining points of language usage. In addition, this represents an opportunity for cross-curricular cooperation between teaching in computer science and language. From neurodidactics we know that the learning and memorizing process in the brain can be supported by using advance organizers such as concept maps for visualizing and structuring the learning contents. With the visual language UML, the Unified Modeling Language, and other diagram types, the field of computer science offers a wide range of such advance organizers. They can be applied for quite a lot of purposes or learning and teaching situations. In this paper we focus on the benefits of computer science models for grammar instruction in foreign language classes aiming at making grammar visible, comprehensible and memorable. We present several ideas for the use of UML diagrams for describing, explaining and learning grammar rules and structures in lucid diagrams. Especially activity and class diagrams or entity-relationship diagrams seem to be very helpful as our experiences gained so far suggest. The paper describes the COOL Informatics teaching approach and it draws a connection between computer science and foreign languages. Furthermore, it shows how to use different types of UML diagrams for visualizing different aspects of grammar teaching and learning. We summarize the most important experiences and results from our last projects related to modeling and present the newest study on UML for grammar learning with some preliminary results.

T1  - Development and validity testing of the Adolescent Health Literacy Questionnaire (AHLQ): Protocol for a mixed methods study within the Irish school setting
AN  - 2459536966
AB  - IntroductionHealth literacy research has focused predominantly on the adult population, and much less is understood about this concept from an adolescent perspective. The tools currently available to measure adolescent health literacy have been adapted from adult versions. This limits their applicability to young people because of the developmental characteristics that impact on adolescents’ behaviour, including impulse control and judgement skills. This protocol describes the intended development and validity testing of a questionnaire to measure health literacy in adolescents.Methods and analysisThis protocol describes this mixed methods study that has three phases: the first phase will involve grounded research with adolescents using qualitative group interviews, co-design and concept mapping workshops to understand what health and healthy behaviours mean to adolescents and to explore their health literacy needs and the potential domains for the questionnaire. The draft health literacy domains identified will be presented to the youth advisory panel, and the questionnaire will be altered based on their feedback. Cognitive pretesting of the questionnaire items will also be conducted. Phase 2 will involve piloting the questionnaire to a two-stage random sample of young people in five urban and rural schools in Ireland. Test–retest reliability will be conducted using Pearson correlation coefficient. Confirmatory factor analysis will also be conducted to analyse the psychometric properties of the questionnaire. Phase 3 will involve the questionnaire being rolled out to a nationally representative sample of adolescents (n=6052) in Ireland to assess their levels of health literacy.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval to conduct this study has been granted from the University College Dublin Human Research Ethics Committee – Sciences (LS-20–08). Informed assent from adolescents and informed consent from parents/guardians will be sought. The findings of this research will be disseminated at national and international conferences, as well as through publication in peer-reviewed journals.

T1  - An Interdisciplinary Teaching Application: The Topic Of Proteins
AN  - 2458790210
AB  - The aim of present research was to examine the effects of interdisciplinary teaching approach on teaching the topic of proteins. In the research, unequal control group model- one of the quasi-experimental research designs was used. The experimental group included 16 students (8 female and 8 male) whereas the control group included 14 students (6 female and 8 male) in this research- which was conducted with the participation of the 12th grade students. A lesson plan in which the topic of proteins was taught in interdisciplinary approach was prepared as the tool of application. A concept map prepared by the researcher and a 5-point Likert type of question were used in collected the data. The data collection tool was given to both the experimental group and the control group as a pre-test and post-test. Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, a non-parametric method- was used in comparing the participants’ scores in the pre-test and post-test of concept map and Likert type question. As a result, it was found that the application of interdisciplinary teaching conducted in the experimental group had caused differences in students’ associating the concepts in biology and chemistry available in the topic of proteins and in their perceptions of their skills in this respect.

T1  - Counselor Education Doctoral Students’ Research Self-Efficacy: A Concept Mapping Approach
AN  - 2452934073
AB  - Research self-efficacy (RSE) is a key concept not only for counselor educators as successful researchers but also for the advancement of counselor education field.  In the literature, researchers have studied multiple factors (e.g., research interest, productivity) to understand the complex nature of RSE phenomenon.  Despite being informative, these studies only focused on partial aspects of the multilayered RSE, showing methodological and conceptual limitations.  Particularly, we do not have a holistic understanding of RSE and the interrelated relationship among the factors informing RSE.  In the current study, the researcher used a mixed-methods design, Concept Mapping (Kane & Trochim, 2007) to explore the factors influencing counselor education doctoral students’ RSE in CACREP-accredited doctoral programs.  Current study findings yielded 17 clusters represented in six regions describing the intrapersonal, interpersonal, and systemic levels of Ecological Model (McLeroy et al., 1988).  The researcher discussed the findings in the view of the current literature along with implications for researcher training and future research practices as well as with the limitations of current study.

T1  - An Automated Feedback System to Support Student Learning of Conceptual Knowledge in Writing-To-Learn Activities
AN  - 2451158151
AB  - As a pedagogical strategy, Writing-to-Learn (WTL) intends to use writing to improve students’ understanding of course content. However, most of the existing feedback systems for writing are mainly focused on improving students’ writing skills rather than their conceptual development. In this dissertation, an automatic approach is proposed to generate timely, actionable, and individualized feedback based on comparing knowledge representations extracted from lecture slides and individual students’ writing assignments. The novelty of the proposed approach lies in the feedback generation: to help students assimilate new knowledge into their existing knowledge better, their current knowledge is modeled as a set of matching concepts; suggested concepts and concept relationships for inclusion are generated as feedback by combining two factors, i.e., importance and relevance, of feedback candidates to the matching concepts in the domain knowledge. In the prototype system, a student can request feedback many times; each set of feedback is generated for a corresponding assignment draft to support their learning of conceptual knowledge during the iterative process of writing an assignment. 
This research conducts a repeated measures study across two semesters (N=88) to understand how students perceive the proposed system, explore how students use the automated feedback, and investigate the effects of the automated feedback on student learning. Survey results show that the feedback is perceived as relevant (78.4%), easy to understand (82.9%), accurate (76.1%) and useful (79.5%); survey results also find that the proposed system makes it easier to study course concepts (80.7%) and is useful in learning course concepts (77.3%). Based on the log analysis of students’ actual usage of the system, all participants request feedback at least once when using the proposed system. After requesting feedback, 83 out of 88 participants revise their assignments. Analyses of students’ submitted assignments reveal that more course concepts and concept relationships are included when completed using the proposed system. Collectively, these results show that the proposed automated feedback prototype system contributes to students incorporating more course concepts and concept relationships into their writing assignments, thus supports their learning of conceptual knowledge in a WTL activity.

T1  - Preferred learning styles of medical students in an Indian medical school: Implications for learner-centered pedagogy in competency-based medical education
AN  - 2450656659
AB  - [4] In light of this, literature reports several definitions of learning style, some of them are as follows: "Learning style is defined psychologically as the way students concentrate, and their method in processing and obtaining information, knowledge, or experience.'"[5] Neil Fleming, the discoverer of VARK, refers to "Learning Styles is an individual's preferred ways of gathering, organizing, and thinking about information."

[10] A multipronged approach is necessary to keep the attention and motivation of students intact, for example, supplementing study material with active learning modules such as problem-based learning, small group discussions, quizzes, animations, role plays, etc.

Visual learners learn by looking at pictures, graphs, videos, text, and graphics in multimedia elements, charts, algorithms, concept maps, posters, mnemonics, visual analogies, annotations, and computer-based teaching modules, auditory learners receive learning by podcasts, discussion, reading loudly, story-telling, audiobooks, audio application in multimedia elements, Readers/writers prefer words, and texts as an information obtaining method while Kinesthetic learners are more likely to experience physical movement aspects while studying such as touch, feel, and hold and perform.

The highest learning modality was Auditory (25.3%), then Read/ Write (9.3%), followed by Kinesthetic and Visual (both 2.7%).

[...]the order of learning style as depicted by results for the given batch was: A> R/W> K = V [Figure 1].

T1  - The Use of Concept Maps as an Assessment Tool in Physics Classes: Can One Use Concept Maps for Quantitative Evaluations?
AN  - 2450310748
AB  - The aim of the present research was to explore the use of concept maps as an assessment tool. The research question posed was: can concept maps be used to quantitatively assess the learning of a physics topic in an engineering course? This paper describes a new approach to quantifying concept maps. The research was preceded by a pilot project that allowed the necessary processes for the proper conduct of the research to be developed. The sample comprised 47 first-year engineering students who were asked to construct a concept map about the content of electrostatic interactions. The concept maps the students prepared were valued quantitatively and qualitatively by an expert instructor. To validate the approach, an analysis of the relationship between the scores given in the three evaluation forms was made. A comparative statistical analysis of the multiple-choice examination data with the quantitative and the qualitative evaluations of the concept maps found not only that there were no significant differences between them in either case, but also that they were moderately, but significantly, correlated. These results suggest that we are on the right track to obtain an effective and easy-to-use tool to evaluate the students’ learning results based on the quantitative assessment of the conceptual maps elaborated by them. Moreover, the analysis of the concept maps in the pilot stage allowed the difficulties that the students had during their learning to be detected, which led to the sequencing of the content of the electrostatic interactions topic being changed.

T1  - Cognitive Learning Analytics Using Assessment Data and Concept Map: A Framework-Based Approach for Sustainability of Programming Courses
AN  - 2438863590
AB  - Students of initial level programming courses generally face difficulties while learning the programming concepts. The learning analytics studies, in these courses, are mostly anecdotal on the aspect of assessment as less or no attention is given to assess learning at various cognitive levels of specific concepts. Furthermore, the existing work reflects deficiencies in examining the effect of learners’ cognitive performance on subsequent stages of the course. This gap needs to be addressed by introducing more granular and methodical approaches of cognitive analysis for sustaining the programming courses effectively in computer science and associated disciplines. In this article, a framework-based approach is proposed for cognitive learning analytics on the concepts taught in initial level programming courses. The framework serves as a platform that provides structure to the concept data using the technique of concept mapping and examines learners’ cognitive propagation on related concepts using assessment data. Learners’ performance prediction has been examined on relatively higher-level programming concepts through the metrics established from the cognitive maps of learners, acquired by deploying the related layers of framework. Overall maximum prediction accuracy range obtained was 64.81% to 90.86%, which was better than the prediction accuracies presented in most of the related studies.

T1  - Three Approaches to the Design of a Golden Online Course on Data Structure
AN  - 2425612399
AB  - Conference Title: 2020 IEEE 2nd International Conference on Computer Science and Educational Informatization (CSEI)Conference Start Date:  2020,  June  12 Conference End Date:  2020,  June  14 Conference Location: Xinxiang, ChinaThe problem of Attention Deficit Disorder is more noticeable in online teaching than in face-to-face teaching. Facing the new requests of constructing Golden Course and based on the analysis of the relationship between Golden Course and Attention Deficit Disorder, the paper takes the national-level MOOC, Data structure, as an example and explores three approaches to solve the problem of Attention Deficit Disorder from the perspective of teaching content organization and implementation. These three approaches are also the core strategies for Golden Course design. The main content is as follows. First, establish the levels of learning objectives under the guidance of BLOOM model, and optimize the design of learning objectives with Mager method, so that students can obtain specific information, find correct learning direction, and avoid lack of attention. Second, use concept map to select and divide learning content, highlighting the importance and relevance of learning content, and ensure that the content is explained within about 10 minutes. Although the time is fragmented, the content is not fragmented. Third, the BOPPPS model is used to organize the process of course implementation and introduce the learning content under the guidance of questions, so as to ensure that the internal logic of the course is compact and effective, and students' interest in learning can be enhanced. Practice shows that the curriculum design strategy which combines the three approaches mentioned above can effectively solve the problem of Attention Deficit Disorder. The course, Data Structure, constructed with three mentioned approaches, was selected as one of the national-level MOOCs in January 2019, which has been running for 4 years on the net for 7 semesters, with a course rating score of 4.8 points out of 5 points, and taken by more than 70,000 learners.

T1  - A Qualitative Study of Visualization Skills Used to Understand Chemical Bonding Theories
AN  - 2425565105
AB  - Visualization skills and spatial ability are necessary for understanding the 3-dimensional shapes of molecules using Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory, hybrid orbital theory and understanding of sigma and pi bonding. Much research has been completed on visualization skills and alternative conceptions in chemistry education but there has been little focus on studying these skills for understanding of bonding theory in college chemistry. The aim of this study is to acquire an understanding of how community college chemistry students visualize in 3D and to collect feedback on their experiences of learning in order to provide information for better assessment tools and teaching strategies.
The method in this study involved interviewing 15 community college students who were either in the second semester of General Chemistry or taking Organic Chemistry. Data were transcribed and analyzed in conjunction with drawings and molecular models that were constructed and coded for recurring themes and concept understanding. It was found that most participants had a good understanding of molecular polarity and could use VSEPR theory to get the correct shape. Some found that using the Cartesian coordinate axis as a guide helped them to translate between the 2D Lewis structure and the 3D shape. Many had difficulty understanding symmetry, expressing 3-dimensionality in their drawings, determining expanded octet shapes, understanding hybrid orbital theory and understanding how the sigma and pi bonds form. Some of the recurring themes that emerged were the ‘value of using models’, a ‘disconnect’ between concepts, a lack of adequate ‘time’ spent on certain topics and the need to teach the requisite ‘terminology’. Some novel alternative conceptions were identified. These include  associating the unhybridized p-orbital with a lone electron pair, associating the pi bond with the p-orbital and the sigma bond with the s-orbital, associating the bond type with the hybridization, considering molecules with partial symmetry as symmetrical and the identification of a sigma bond as a single bond and a pi bond as a double or triple bond.  Other alternative conceptions identified were consistent with what was found in the literature. Novel recommendations were made on how to address these alternative conceptions and the student concerns that were expressed. Additionally, several concept maps were generated to outline how bonding theories could be learned in a series of steps to solve problems involving 3D structures in chemistry in order to minimize the development of  alternative conceptions.

T1  - Concept Mapping in Magnetism and Electrostatics: Core Concepts and Development over Time
AN  - 2398952651
AB  - Conceptual change theories assume that knowledge structures grow during the learning process but also get reorganized. Yet, this reorganization process itself is hard to examine. By using concept maps, we examined the changes in students’ knowledge structures and linked it to conceptual change theory. In a longitudinal study, thirty high-achieving students (M = 14.41 years) drew concept maps at three timepoints across a teaching unit on magnetism and electrostatics. In total, 87 concept maps were analyzed using betweenness and PageRank centrality as well as a clustering algorithm. We also compared the students’ concept maps to four expert maps on the topic. Besides a growth of the knowledge network, the results indicated a reorganization, with first a fragmentation during the unit, followed by an integration of knowledge at the end of the unit. Thus, our analysis revealed that the process of conceptual change on this topic was non-linear. Moreover, the terms used in the concept maps varied in their centrality, with more abstract terms being more central and thus more important for the structure of the map. We also suggest ideas for the usage of concept maps in class.

T1  - Perception of medical students and faculty toward concept mapping as a teaching-learning method in pharmacology
AN  - 2393079435
AB  - [1,2] With the introduction of revised basic Course Workshops by the Medical Council of India, it can be easily interpreted that the scenario of medical education will change with the introduction of principles of adult learning during planning and implementation of new curriculum.

[3] Concept mapping is the proven technique in problem-based learning in many disciplines and is widely used all over the world right from school education to adult learning.

[8] The use of this tool can strengthen the concepts in the evolution phase during cognitive structuring of student for learning.

[...]concept mapping might provide a solid tool which can be used on day-to-day basis.

RESULTS In this study, 110 students and 8 faculty members (including postgraduate students) attended the orientation session on concept mapping and out of them, 105 students and 5 faculty members gave informed consent.

T1  - Structural Analysis of Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, and Metacognitive Knowledge in a Multidimensional Knowledge Network
AN  - 2381578394
AB  - Discovering the most suitable network structure of the learning domain represents one of the main challenges of knowledge delivery and acquisition. We propose a multidimensional knowledge network (MKN) consisting of three components: multilayer network and its two projections. Each network layer constitutes factual, conceptual, procedural, or metacognitive knowledge within the domain of databases as a standard course of computer science study. In the MKN layer, nodes are concepts or knowledge units and the edges are weighted with regard to Bloom's cognitive learning level. The projected network layers are contrasted with a monolayer network by comparing characterizations of the centrality measures: degree centrality, closeness centrality, betweenness centrality, and eccentricity. The study revealed indications of how concepts, supported with the higher number of previously introduced concepts, have a dominant role in knowledge acquisition, from a view of knowledge structure and content. The analysis of communities, assortativity coefficient, and overlap between MKN layers contributes to better structuring of knowledge. MKN enables systematic insights into the efficiency of knowledge integration across metacognitive layers, as well as the detection of crucial cognitive concepts that reduce/increase the cognitive load during learning.

T1  - The Effect of Case-Based Learning with or without Conceptual Mapping Method on Critical Thinking and Academic Self-Efficacy of Nursing Students
AN  - 2369134477
AB  - Objectives: Learning is an essential challenge in nursing student’s education. Beneficent learning has a major impact on upbringing efficient nurses. However, one of the methods for achieving optimal learning is using combined strategies for education. Thus, the aim of this study was to assess the effect of case-based learning with or without conceptual mapping on nursing student’s critical thinking and academic self-efficacy. Material and Methods: The present semi-experimental study was conducted among 55 nursing students in their fourth semester of the curriculum (28 students in the experimental group and 27 students in the control group). Before beginning the education, critical thinking and academic self-efficacy of students in both groups were assessed by the California Critical Thinking Skills Test form B (CCTST) and College Academic Self-Efficacy Scale (CASES). The control and experimental groups were educated with concept mapping teaching method and without concept mapping teaching method, respectively, for a duration of 8 weeks (each session lasted for 45 minutes). Statistical analysis was accomplished by SPSS software, version 13. Results: There were no statistically significant differences between both groups in regards to demographic characteristics. In the control group, critical thinking significantly increased at the end of the trial in comparison to the beginning of the procedure (p<0.001). However, there were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in regards to academic self-efficacy (p=0.06). In the educational group, both critical thinking and academic self-efficacy differed significantly when comparing the beginning and end of the intervention (p=0.001). In this regards, both critical thinking and academic self-efficacy increased after the intervention. Comparing the average scores of post-test analysis of groups for critical thinking and academic self-efficacy were statistically insignificant. Conclusions: Using integrative education methods such as conceptual mapping in combination with case-based education had a significant effect on enhancing student’s critical thinking and academic self-efficacy.

T1  - The Healthy Hawai‘i Initiative: insights from two decades of building a culture of health in a multicultural state
AN  - 2357913853
AB  - Background 
The Healthy Hawai‘i Initiative was created in 2000 with tobacco settlement funds as a theory-based statewide effort to promote health-supporting environments through systems and policy change. Still active today, it is imbedded explicitly in a multi-sectoral, social ecological approach, effectively striving to build a culture of health before this was the name for such an ambitious effort.
 Methods 
From interviews with key informants, we analyze two decades of the Healthy Hawai‘i Initiative (HHI) in the context of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Culture of Health Action Framework (CHAF). We list HHI accomplishments and examine how the Initiative achieved notable policy and environmental changes supportive of population health.
 Results 
The Healthy Hawai‘i Initiative started with an elaborate concept-mapping process that resulted in a common vision about making “the healthy choice the easiest choice.” Early on, the Initiative recognized that making health a shared value beyond the initial stakeholders required coalition and capacity building across a broad range of governmental and nonprofit actors. HHI coalitions were designed to promote grassroots mobilization and to link community leaders across sectors, and at their height, included over 500 members across all main islands of the state. Coalitions were particularly important for mobilizing rural communities. Additionally, the Initiative emphasized accessibility to public health data, published research, and evaluation reports, which strengthened the engagement to meet the shared vision and goals between diverse sector partners and HHI. Over the past two decades, HHI has capitalized on relationship building, data sharing, and storytelling to encourage a shared value of health among lawmakers, efforts which are believed to have led to the development of health policy champions. All of these factors combined, which centered on developing health as a shared value, have been fundamental to the success of the other three action areas of the CHAF over time.
 Conclusions 
This evidence can provide critical insights for other communities at earlier stages of implementing broad, diverse, multifaceted system change and fills a key evidence gap around building a culture of health from a mature program in a notably multicultural state.

T1  - Graphical Tools for Conceptualizing Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education
AN  - 2327320714
AB  - One challenge associated with introducing systems thinking in chemistry classrooms is the increase in content complexity that students face when they engage in this type of approach. Placing core chemical ideas within larger systems has promise, as long as students are not overwhelmed by the added complexity. Although there are many potential strategies for dealing with complexity, one common tool is to employ visual or graphical tools to help conceptualize the problem or system at hand. In part because systems thinking touches on many potential levels of implementation, there are different visual tools that are helpful in conceptualizing different aspects. Some tools, such as systems-oriented concept map extension (SOCME) diagrams and systemigrams, use methodologies often associated with concept mapping but add features that enhance their applicability in systems thinking. Object–Process Methodology (OPM), which has seen fairly wide use in systems engineering contexts, uses formally defined components and links between them to help conceptualize systems and problems. Many systems of interest are dynamic in nature so tools such as behavior over time graphs (BOTG) are helpful in calibrating the temporal aspects of systems. Such dynamics are also captured via causal loop diagrams and stock and flow diagrams. Here, we introduce and describe the affordances of multiple types of graphical tools that can be used to support systems thinking approaches in chemistry education. Knowing the uses and advantages of these different tools will allow instructors to make informed choices about the tools that will best meet a particular educational goal when using systems thinking approaches in the classroom.

T1  - Integrating the Molecular Basis of Sustainability into General Chemistry through Systems Thinking
AN  - 2327317413
AB  - The flow of materials and energy through society is an integral but poorly visible element of global sustainability agendas such as the Planetary Boundaries Framework and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG). Given that the primary activities of chemistry are to analyze, synthesize, and transform matter, the practice of chemistry has a great deal to contribute to sustainability science, which in turn should play an increasingly important role in reshaping the practice of chemistry. Success in integrating sustainability considerations into the practice of chemistry implies a substantial role for chemistry education to better equip students to address the sustainability of earth and societal systems. Building on the framework of the IUPAC Systems Thinking in Chemistry Education (STICE) project, we develop approaches to using systems thinking to educate students about the molecular basis of sustainability, to assist chemistry to contribute meaningfully and visibly toward the attainment of global sustainability agendas. A detailed exemplar shows how ubiquitous coverage in general chemistry courses of the Haber–Bosch process for the synthesis of ammonia could be extended using systems thinking to consider the complex interplay of this industrial process with scientific, societal, and environmental systems. Systems thinking tools such as systems thinking concept map extension (SOCME) visualizations assist in highlighting inputs, outputs, and societal consequences of this large-scale industrial process, including both intended and unintended alterations to the planetary cycle of nitrogenous compounds. Strategies for using systems thinking in chemistry education and addressing the challenges its use may bring to educators and students are discussed, and suggestions are offered for general chemistry instructors using systems thinking to educate about the molecular basis of sustainability.

T1  - Pre-service Physics Teachers Perception about Concept Map, Mind map, and Link Map for Innovative Learning
AN  - 2568361085
AB  - This study aims to describe students’ perceptions of the characteristics of assisted learning mapping methods such as concept maps (CM), mind maps (MM), and link maps (LM). The study was conducted with qualitative and quantitative data collection with a sample of 10 students as pre-service physics teachers. Quantitative data becomes a supporting part of the qualitative description. Each student was asked to make a concept map, mind map, and link maps with physics material. Furthermore, students’ performance is analyzed in the description form of the differences and effectiveness of the mapping when applied in physics learning. These results indicated that mapping has a positive effect on the development of students’ thinking abilities, especially in identifying the right concepts for physics material.

T1  - Planning, implementation, and evaluation of multicomponent, case-based learning for first-year Indian medical undergraduates
AN  - 2319714995
AB  - Didactic lecture is an effective method to quickly pass on a high volume of information to a large number of students. However, if not well designed, lectures can be monotonous and provide only passive learning, with little scope for higher order learning skills. To address this drawback of lectures, we supplemented it with case-based learning (CBL), which has been shown to promote self-learning. After giving an overview of gastrointestinal physiology through lectures, CBL on peptic ulcer disease was implemented for first-year Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery students. The present study aimed to evaluate the students' and teachers' opinions on the notion of supplementing lectures with CBL. In previous reports, discussion using clinical cases was primarily employed as the solitary component for conducting CBL. In the present study, three different but mutually exclusive components, such as case discussion, concept map, and critical thinking exercise on a specific topic in gastrointestinal pathophysiology, were integrated to form the multicomponent CBL (MC-CBL). Students reported that MC-CBL could promote application of the knowledge learned in lectures in a more appropriate context (92.42% positive response), enhance their learning efficiency (98.46% positive response), promote their active participation in the learning process (98.48% positive response), and help them in integrating physiological concepts with clinical science (98.46% positive response). Teachers observed that MC-CBL could promote active learning, analytic, and problem-solving skills of students. In conclusion, MC-CBL appeared to be an effective supplement for the lectures, providing an opportunity for the students to relate the knowledge learned during lectures.

T1  - "Sugar Mapping", an Easy-To-Use Visual Tool To Help the Synthetic Chemist Identify Carbohydrate Stereochemical Relationships
AN  - 2318635746
AB  - A "map" is presented to describe the different stereochemical relationships among carbohydrates, in both the hexose and pentose series. When implemented, it allows chemistry students, teachers, and researchers to readily identify different sugars' stereochemical interconnections. It may also help orient chemists toward retrosyntheses, in which carbohydrates are used as starting material goals.

T1  - Exploration of perceptions of health of low SES citizens in the Netherlands
AN  - 2430178259
AB  - Background Health promotion programs (HPPs) have not yet succeeded in substantially reducing the health gap between higher and lower socioeconomic groups. It is thus a challenge to develop more effective strategies, based on an ecological perspective. To develop such strategies and activate citizens, this study explores citizens’ perceptions of health and what they need to improve it. Methods Setting Community HPP Voorstad on the Move (VoM) (July 2016-Jan 2020) in a district (+-11,000 inhabitants) in Deventer. Inhabitants’ socioeconomic status (SES), perceived health status and lifestyle are low relative to other city districts. Study design: A qualitative study of 11 community groups (n = 89) participating in two focus groups. Concept mapping was used to cluster and prioritize health perceptions. Social Practice Theory (SPT) guided the analysis of needs to change health-related behavior. Results “We don’t assume that everyone has the same idea about health, do we?” (citizen) Participants differed in age (16-82), cultural background (17% non-Dutch origin) and type of group activity. High-ranking dimensions of health are social relations, physical activity, a positive life attitude, healthy eating and empowerment. To improve health, social support from family and friends and self-confidence were the main needs. Physical impediments, (chronic) illness and financial aspects were also mentioned as barriers. The focus groups contributed to new activities as part of the VoM program facilitated by a health broker: e.g. a swimming group, biking buddies, social meetings. Conclusions Citizens perceive health as multidimensional, encompassing the physical and social environment, lifestyle behaviors, positive attitudes and being in control. Using SPT to unravel these needs in terms of meanings and competences helped to facilitate citizens’ active involvement in health-promoting activities. Key messages    Low SES citizens perceive social relations, physical activity and a positive life attitude as important dimensions of health.   Insight into citizens’ meanings and competences about health behaviors facilitates the development of health-promoting activities.

T1  - Understanding changes in soft drinks marketing after introduction of the UK Soft Drinks Industry Levy: developing a theory of change by use of concept mapping and stakeholder interviews
AN  - 2319466566
AB  - Background In 2018, the UK government introduced a Soft Drinks Industry Levy (SDIL) to reduce the consumption of sugary drinks and their health consequences. Taxes on sugary drinks might prompt changes in associated marketing, but whether and how this happens, and the implications for health, are unclear. To inform exploration of changes in sugary drinks marketing that might result from the SDIL, we developed a theory of change by use of concept mapping and stakeholder interviews. Methods We used concept mapping, an inductive technique, to develop an initial theory. We then elaborated this theory on the basis of one-to-one telephone interviews with six representatives of each of industry, academia, and civil society (total n=18), who had experience of strategic decision-making or marketing by sugary drinks firms. Interviewees were recruited using seed and snowballing sampling. Interviews explored motivations for and manifestations of changes in soft drink marketing. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and thematically analysed. To maximise trustworthiness, four transcripts were double-coded, the revised theory was informally peer reviewed, three transcripts were excluded from initial coding to allow comparison with the revised theory, and the resultant theory was validated by interviewees. Findings The initial theory described strategic planning and decision-making followed by the analysis and selection of specific marketing responses. After analysis of interviews we developed this concept into an iterative and circular theory of marketing change. Briefly, firms change marketing by reviewing their internal and external context, identifying a catalyst, deciding their brand positioning, and then selecting a combination of strategies to enact this positioning. Resultant changes in purchasing feed back into factors internal and external to the firm. Ethics approval was granted by the University of Cambridge Humanities and Social Sciences Research Ethics Committee. Interpretation These findings extend understanding of industry responses to sugary drinks taxes and might be relevant for understanding of industry responses to fiscal interventions more generally. Our theory highlights that soft drinks firms are continually evolving, consider many external factors in addition to the SDIL, and think about marketing more broadly than just advertising. Our research was based on one case study of the SDIL; interviews were done 1 year after implementation of the levy. Future work should prospectively test our theory in alternative contexts.

T1  - Adding Narrative to Gamification and Educational Games With Generic Templates
AN  - 2317556049
AB  - Adding narrative, that is, a story, to gamification and educational games can boost students' motivation and engagement. This requires a narrative fitting the course in which it will be deployed to and a gameplay to which the narrative fits without seeming to be tacked on. In this article, a gamification template called Reification and an education game template called Synapses are introduced both aiming at relieving educators from having to find an appropriate game or gamification leaving them only the task of finding a fitting narrative. Reification is making something abstract concrete with the intention of making the represented concept more tangible. In case of the gamification mechanism Reification, a learner's progress in a course is made concrete through visualization: A student's progress is visualized as a landscape in which each object, such as a tree, makes concrete one of the student's accomplishments, such as a solved exercise. Reification aims to provide students with a tangible overview of their learning progress and allows them to compare their landscape to their peers'. Reification is illustrated in the article with a course on Egyptology. Synapses is a game which supports students in overcoming and preventing the development of misconceptions, which are commonly held incorrect beliefs by students about courses' contents. After each lecture, students are tasked to organize parts of the lecture's content in a concept map, or to revise their concept maps in reaction to mistakes made in exercises. The game's narrative takes different turns depending on the percentage of students having a correct concept map. Synapses is illustrated in the article with a course on Logic. This article represents a work-in-progress: The concepts are grounded in theory with evaluations of the introduced implementations planned for future work.

T1  - The influence of team psychological safety on team knowledge creation: a study with French and American engineering teams
AN  - 2272629457
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to explore the impact of team psychological safety and team learning on the creation of team knowledge. When teams engage in learning, their interactions contribute to improved performance. Very little research evaluates whether the learning also creates new knowledge related to the task or the team itself.Design/methodology/approachThe proposed model is evaluated through a mixed method research design around a team problem-solving experiment. Task- and team-related team mental models are elicited using concept mapping and questionnaires and are measured before and after the experiment. The model is evaluated in engineering teams from the USA and France.FindingsThe findings confirm the proposed model; team psychological safety and team learning positively impact team knowledge creation for both task- and team-related knowledge.Originality/valueThis research has theoretical, methodological and practical implications. The team psychological safety model is expanded, team learning is evaluated from the team interactions instead of members’ self-assessments and team knowledge is measured dynamically. Developing team psychological safety and creating team learning opportunities positively impacts the team’s knowledge.

T1  - It's All Relative! Engaging Nursing and Exercise Science Students in Chemical Education Using Medical Case Studies
AN  - 2309321518
AB  - Chemical education for health profession curricula has the rigorous task of balancing chemical concepts in relation to healthcare and concepts presented on health profession graduate school admissions and/or licensing exams (such as NCLEX, nursing licensure; and MCAT, medical school admissions), often within a limited time frame. In an attempt to achieve this measure, an engaging learning activity was designed to help nursing (and a number of exercise sciences) students identify chemical education topics in published medical case studies. Student perception of the significance and practicality of this activity was examined. Three groups of students (Ntotal = 167) were provided with a number of published medical case studies and instructed to employ concept mapping techniques to "map out" how examples of four chemical education topics (analytical, biological, general, and organic) were identified in these clinical cases. The overall goal of this project is to allow students to (1) identify, (2) categorize and conceptualize, and (3) apply chemical knowledge in their present studies and overall future healthcare professions. As a result, a marked decline in course fail/pass ratios was observed. Additionally, over 80% of the students who completed the concept map activity voluntary survey highlighted their ability to identify chemistry in healthcare settings after completing the assignment. Student polling also highlighted recommendations for chemistry education in undergraduate health profession curricula, following this activity.

T1  - The influence of concept maps and visuospatial representations to students achievement and creativity on plant anatomy courses
AN  - 2568467770
AB  - Concept maps used to understand the concept of plant anatomy, and visuospatial representations are used to create 3 dimensions the imagination concept from two dimension images to 3 dimension concrete. That is can improve creativity. The purpose of the research was to know the effect of a concept map and visuospatial representation to the students achievement and creativity on plant anatomy courses. Method of this research was correlational, the sample was the biology perspective teacher students who take plant anatomy courses amount of 34 students. A deductive approach was used in learning and used Wimba model learning as a learning model based on visuospatial. Data collecting used concept map rubric plant anatomy test, visuospatial assessment and creativity. Data processing was multiple regression test. The result shows that simultaneously concept maps and 3D representation have a very significant effect on students achievement and creativity. The conclusion was the concept mapping and 3D representation effective to improve students achievement and creativity.

T1  - Exploring Underlying Causes of Cross-National Differences in Intellectual Property Ethics: A Concept-Map
AN  - 2317560609
AB  - Previous research has documented evidence of significant differences in intellectual property protection across countries. However, our knowledge towards the underlying causes of the differences remains scarce and fragmentary. Through a systematic review of the recent literature on intellectual property and intellectual capital, this paper identifies a family of factors that may explain the variances, and argues that in order to develop effective strategies on IP protection, a given country's cultural, economic, political, and social contexts must be all considered.

T1  - Capturing and Sharing Intangible Cultural Heritage Through Knowledge Visualisation and Knowledge Modelling Tools
AN  - 2317555847
AB  - This paper aims to analyse and identify effective knowledge capture and knowledge sharing mechanisms for intangible cultural heritage (ICH), more specifically, craft knowledge (specific manufacturing processes). Identification of such mechanisms is important because those who master such practices are passing away. We analysed the current approaches of international organisations to preserving ICH, and craft ICH as a type of knowledge, and concluded that craft ICH is largely a tacit type of knowledge, embedded living knowledge interwoven with the cultural and historical context of its creation and its present actualisation. We then analysed the methods and tools that capture knowledge using Knowledge Management (KM), Knowledge Modelling and Knowledge Visualisation with focus on the potential for capturing and sharing craft processes, skills and the cultural and historical context of ICH. In addition to traditional instruments in knowledge modelling and knowledge visualisation, we are seeking to exploit the possibilities of (digital) storytelling to capture of the historical and cultural context, and the potential for augmented reality to transfer craft skills. The outcome of our study is a theoretical outline of a specific craft ICH Knowledge Model (K-Model) based on the principle of concept map, which should be interactive, user-friendly and in which various types of formal and informal contents are incorporated (text, sketch, pictures, diagrams, audio, video, augmented reality, Web links, etc.). The effectiveness of the craft ICH K-Models designed will then be empirically tested in various cultural and historical contexts, and the K-Model will be iteratively improved by the SlovakPortugal research team.

T1  - RF33 Evaluation of public health interventions using a complex systems lens: a critical review
AN  - 2288751566
AB  - BackgroundThere has been a growth in interest in applying systems thinking to public health research: including greater consideration of the complex and changing nature of real-world environments within which public health interventions take place. In this paper we present the results from a critical review that asked the question: how can a systems approach be applied in the context of public health evaluation?MethodsA critical review of the literature was conducted to identify contrasting examples of systems approaches for in-depth comparison and analysis. To inform our protocol and identify relevant studies we held consultations with international researchers with relevant expertise (n=32). We tracked citations from previous reviews and searched Scopus, Medline and Web of Science from 01/01/14 to 06/08/17. We used search terms relating to systems and complexity, evaluation, public health and its social determinants. Our inclusion criteria were as follows: studies must (i) self-identify as taking a systems or complexity-informed approach; and (ii) evaluate one or more interventions or changes in a public health relevant field. Study selection, appraisal, data extraction and analysis were conducted independently by at least two reviewers with regular meetings to discuss contrasting viewpoints.ResultsForty-four studies were finally included. Public health topics varied: the most common concerned obesity, transport, education, and tobacco. Evaluations were classified by the systems approach taken; in total 6 approaches were identified: qualitative research (n=13), concept mapping (n=3), network analysis (n=4), system dynamics modelling (n=15), agent-based modelling (n=8), and ‘systems friendly’ approaches (n=5). These different approaches were used to address different research questions but there was also cross-over between methodological approach and purpose. Some studies lacked clear empirical conclusions for informing future practice.DiscussionThough sometimes portrayed as a novel development in public health research, there are already numerous examples of different public health ‘systems evaluations’. There is no single or dominant ‘systems approach’ to public health evaluation. Nor is there a consistent pattern whereby different approaches address research questions specific to that approach. Rather than advocate for a single approach to systems evaluation, we believe continued innovation in this field is most helpful at this time. To improve utility, some systems evaluations would benefit from improvements in the reporting of empirical findings.

T1  - Using metro lines for integration of nucleotide metabolic pathways
AN  - 2285238084
AB  - Students always encounter difficulties in studying biochemical pathways. They are especially weak in understanding the relationships between metabolic pathways and their integration because these pathways are always taught one‐by‐one in class. In the past, various online resources have been developed to facilitate students' understanding toward energy metabolism. Although these learning materials enable students to understand individual metabolic pathway in a clearer manner, many of them fail to demonstrate the linkages between these pathways. The “AG City” is a self‐learning tool which aims to arouse students' interest in exploring nucleotide metabolism. We have designed a metro map as a concept map to allow students to have an overview of different pathways as well as their integration. Major pathways are presented as railway lines in an easy‐to‐understand and interactive manner using navigation, animations, and narrations. Key molecules involved in the pathways are presented as “railway stations”. Students can easily identify common “railway stations” presented in different pathways and link the concepts that they have learnt together. This interactive self‐learning tool has been packaged as a courseware using the Articulate Storyline eLearning authoring software. © 2019 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 47(5):532–537, 2019.

T1  - Interdisciplinary science concept maps to orient middle secondary school students learning outcomes
AN  - 2567800022
AB  - The initial and continuing training of natural science teachers should be implemented in interdisciplinary contexts. This paper shows how concept maps can generate training activities in which teachers of various disciplines can discuss macro concepts such as water, air, wind, temperature, motion, power, energy, etc. mapping the students’ learning pathway. Drawing concept maps and discussing them in training sessions from the perspective of students, teachers and trainers can be a decisive professional experience in changing the ways of improving concepts representations of all the actors of classroom activities and educators.

T1  - Spiral teaching sequence and concept maps for facilitating conceptual reasoning of acceleration
AN  - 2336304821
AB  - This study involved a spiral teaching sequence on acceleration using four instructional strategies, namely: 1) preview of the core concepts, 2) a concept map, 3) conceptual questions, and 4) review of the solutions with a focus on the effective derivation routes and the prevalent difficulties that the students encountered. The participants were 402 grade 12 high school students. The results of this study reveal that the spiral teaching sequence, which introduced multiple stages of practicing and instructional explanation, was effective in terms of improving the students' conceptual reasoning of acceleration. The review of the solutions was perceived by the participants as the most effective teaching strategy, followed by the concept map. We also found that conceptual questions involving a single concept were mostly easier to solve than those involving multiple concepts.

T1  - Using network science to analyze concept maps of psychology undergraduates
AN  - 2254827088
AB  - Network science is an emerging area of complexity science that uses mathematical techniques to study complex systems and could represent a new way of quantifying and investigating the internal structure of domain‐specific knowledge as approximated by students' concept maps. Students enrolled in introductory psychology constructed concept maps to represent their understanding of a psychology chapter. Concept networks were constructed based on the concept maps generated by students. Network analysis revealed that the structure of concept networks differed across students (i.e., some networks were better connected than others), and network structure significantly predicted quiz scores, such that concept networks with larger average shortest path lengths (a network metric representing the average of the shortest paths between two nodes in a network) were associated with higher quiz scores, after controlling for network size. This paper illustrates how network science techniques can be used to quantify the conceptual structure of a learner's knowledge.

T1  - Assessing Interdisciplinary Competency in the Disaster Resilience and Risk Management Graduate Program using Concept Maps
AN  - 2314036618
AB  - Concept maps have emerged as a valid and reliable method for assessing deep conceptual understanding in engineering education within disciplines as well as interdisciplinary knowledge integration across disciplines. Most work on concept maps, however, focuses on undergraduates. In this paper, we use concept maps to examine changes in graduate students’ conceptual understanding and knowledge integration resulting from an interdisciplinary graduate program.
Our study context is pair of foundational, team-taught courses in an interdisciplinary Disaster Resilience and Risk Management (DRRM) graduate program. The courses include a 3-hour research course and a 1-hour seminar that aim to build student understanding within and across Urban Affairs and Planning, Civil and Environmental Engineering, Geosciences, and Business Information Technology. The courses introduce core principles of DRRM and relevant research methods in these disciplines, and drive students to understand the intersections of these disciplines in the context of planning for and responding to natural and human-made disasters. To understand graduate student growth from disciplinary-based to interdisciplinary scholars, we pose the research questions: 1) In what ways do graduate students’ understandings of DRRM change as a result of their introduction to an interdisciplinary graduate research program? and 2) To what extent and in what ways do concept maps serve as a tool to capture interdisciplinary learning in this context?
Data includes pre/post concept maps centered on disaster resilience and risk management, a one-page explanation of the post-concept map, and ethnographic field notes gathered from class and faculty meetings. Pre-concept maps were collected on the first day of class; post-concept maps will be collected as part of the final course assignment. We assess the students’ concept maps for depth of conceptual understanding within disciplines and interdisciplinary competency across disciplines, using the field notes to provide explanatory context.
The results presented in this paper support the inclusion of an explanation component to concept maps, and also suggest that concept maps alone may not be the best measure of student understanding of concepts within and across disciplines in this specific context. If similar programs wish to use concept maps as an assessment method, we suggest the inclusion of an explanation component and suggest providing explicit instructions that specify the intended audience. We also suggest using a holistic scoring method, as it is more likely to capture nuances in the concept maps than traditional scoring methods, which focus solely on counting factors like hierarchies and number of cross-links.

T1  - Board 9: Measuring Change: Research Updates Helping Engineering Students Tackle Complex Sustainability Problems
AN  - 2314034701
AB  - Real-world engineering challenges are open-ended, multi-faceted, and exist within a societal context, requiring knowledge from multiple domains (technical, environmental, economic, and social). Undergraduates gain knowledge in each of those domains from both engineering and non-engineering classes but need guidance when drawing on that knowledge to solve new, complex problems. The research goals guiding this NSF-REE project include: (1) Identify appropriate measures of knowledge transfer/cognitive flexibility that apply to open-ended tasks; (2) Develop and adapt instructional materials and direct assessments to measure and improve students’ ability to transfer knowledge to/across problems; (3) Explore differences in students’ responses to the interventions between different types of engineering programs. The poster will share progress related to each of the goals through methods and results from two types of studies: (1) exploring neuroscience theories and measures related to cognitive load, efficiency, and flexibility for complex problem-solving; and (2) developing and testing a Sustainable Design rubric for use with multi-disciplinary engineering capstone design projects. New activity is described below, including specific objectives for the work and results. After a successful pilot project with an electroencephalogram (EEG), we initiated a study using EEG and self-report data to investigate students’ cognitive activities when completing different tasks related to sustainability like food security and water availability. In particular we are comparing cognitive functions and activation during linear thinking (i.e., listing) tasks and systems thinking (i.e., concept mapping) tasks. We hypothesized that (1) concept maps allow individuals to organize their thoughts within a systems thinking framework, and thus result in a more complete and holistic response than a linear thinking equivalent (i.e., listing task); and (2) creating a concept map is a more complex cognitive process than writing a list of terms and thus students (at least initially) would experience greater cognitive load during cmap tasks.
Rubric work aims to provide engineering educators and students with a learning and assessment tool to enhance sustainable design outcomes of projects. In prior work, expert feedback substantiated parallel validation efforts using text mapping to establish sustainable development frameworks. Guided by the analyses, we iteratively reduced the rubric to 14 distinct criteria, and identified three scoring dimensions (quantitative & qualitative evidence, long-term thinking and lifecycle, and formal methods/documentation) as important considerations for all of the criteria rather than stand-alone criteria. The rubric development process has moved from substantive validation to structural validation with student projects. The first structural study was conducted in Spring 2018 with 51 student users for formative assessment of their preliminary capstone project work. We are currently reviewing quantitative and qualitative data to answer questions such as: (1) Is there a range of responses on the items? Are students using the full 0-3 scale? (2) Which items do we expect to be related? Which items perform as expected? (3) Is there more rating variability across individuals or criteria? The primary objective of analyzing this data, including qualitative coding, is to improve the rubric in terms of content, structure, and implementation. Future work will address other audiences and assessment purposes.

T1  - Thermodynamics for Citizenship: Entrepreneurial Engineering through Project-based Learning
AN  - 2314032100
AB  - Many undergraduate programs in biological and agricultural (BAE) engineering feature service learning opportunities, most frequently in first-year (cornerstone) and senior (capstone) design courses. Given that project based learning (PBL) is one of the known high impact teaching methods, there is potential benefit in exploring how PBL can be used in the second and third years of undergraduate BAE curricula, which are usually dominated by more theoretically focused engineering science courses. This paper describes one effort to introduce an social entrepreneurship engineering project into a 3rd year Thermodynamics course with the goal for the students to apply their newly developed thermodynamics skills in a real world setting, while developing an entrepreneurial engineering mindset and making a difference in peoples’ lives.
The context for the project is food insecurity. One problem at the local foodbank's mobile produce markets is that clients stand in in the summer heat for hours waiting in line. Volunteers also experience heat stress helping pass out the food. Food is delivered via refrigerator truck, but once unloaded, often into an empty blacktopped parking lot, it can be a challenge to keep produce and the occasional perishable items at proper holding temperatures for the four to five hour duration of the food distribution event. A solution is needed to keep people and produce cool. Stakeholders include clients, volunteers, the property owner, nearby property owners, the foodbank, and donors. Students discover the needs of these multiple stakeholders and propose multiple cooling device designs, while developing an entrepreneurial engineering mindset and making a difference in peoples’ lives. This project includes six deliverables spread over one academic term:
1. Concept map exploring connections between energy and (a.) poverty, (b.) food production, processing, and distribution, and (c.) the environment (group assignment, each group picks one of the options) 2. Preliminary documentation of clients’ needs, characteristics, and perspectives. Includes discussion board participation, interview results, on-line and in-person research (individual assignment) 3. Preliminary decision matrix memo documenting 6 different user perspectives (individual assignment) 4. Jigsaw assignment where team representatives investigate different cooling technologies and report back to their teams, (e.g., Refrigeration vapor-compression system, Evaporative cooling system, Thermo-acoustic cooling, and other creative designs) (group assignment) 5. Conceptual design memo documenting multiple different designs to meet needs and create value (group assignment) 6. Final decision matrix poster of one user perspective using 3 designs selected by team from their individual memos (group gallery walk, stakeholder randomly assigned)
The paper also provides a preliminary assessment of the project based on reflections by participating students, instructors, and community volunteers over two years.

T1  - Board 140: FOUNDATIONS – Integrating Evidence-based Teaching and Learning Practices into the Core Engineering Curriculum
AN  - 2314031409
AB  - The project seeks to transform teaching and learning by simultaneously effecting change at the individual faculty level and at the organizational level. Key here is the adoption of evidence-based teaching & learning practices derived from research on cognition and how people learn. To maximize project impact, we focus on the core engineering curriculum and the introductory mathematics, science, and engineering science courses taken by students in their first two years, with approximately 600 students entering engineering each year. Strategies to support faculty change include ongoing discussions of the principles of teaching and learning; engagement in discipline-based education research; provision of trained peer assistants to facilitate active-learning pedagogies in lectures and recitations; use of midterm course evaluations as formative feedback; and advocacy with colleagues to catalyze diffusion beyond these early courses. At the organizational level, the goal is to create a climate where effective teaching is expected, supported and rewarded. A campus-wide baseline survey administered at the start of the project highlighted the institutional climate factors that are likely to support/hinder the transformation to evidence-based teaching. In short, evidence-based practices were generally perceived as not supported or rewarded, not easy to implement, and require development of new skills. The cultural supports for change have been addressed with the Faculty Senate and senior academic administrators. Consequently, in 2017 an explicit goal to implement evidence-based teaching practices was incorporated into the University’s most recent revision of its strategic plan. The project has engaged three cohorts of faculty, with each cohort receiving summer support for three years beginning summer 2016 (N=9), 2017 (N=5), and 2018 (N=5). These are faculty members who teach the core Calculus, Chemistry, Physics and Biology courses, together with the foundational computer programming, and engineering science courses in Engineering Thermodynamics, Engineering Mechanics, and Electrical Circuits. All thirteen of the core courses have so far been impacted to some degree. The faculty engaged to date are heavily weighted towards teaching stream, but our theory of action anticipates these being the champions to effect diffusion through sharing their experiences and successes with the tenure-stream faculty who tend to teach upper-level courses. The extent of participating faculty and organizational transformation is being examined through the lens of limiting-factor analysis (LFA), which identifies and addresses those factors that need to be in place if the project is to be sustainable. To this end, each cohort of participating faculty are interviewed before and after implementing changes. Leadership at all levels of administration (Provost, Dean, Department Chair) are interviewed to ascertain their perceptions of, and support for, transformational change. In addition to LFA, measures of the nature and extent of faculty changes are captured in two ways. First, a yearly teaching practices survey is administered to all faculty teaching a core course. Questions focus on use of active-learning strategies, instructional supports (e.g., TAs, graders, peer leaders), and strategies for monitoring student understanding throughout the course. Second, participating faculty are expected to make changes to their instructional practices, document their rationale for change (e.g., deep learning), nature of that change (e.g., increased emphasis on cross course connections), and evidence that the change was effective (e.g., concept map). Midterm and end-of-course evaluations provide student input on their perceptions of the teaching and learning environment experienced in the core courses taught by both Foundations and non-Foundations faculty. A significant recent outcome was an agreement to coordinate and strengthen TA, tutor, and peer leader training so all can support a student-centered active learning approach to teaching and learning at the college level. Historically, these efforts were handled by different centers on campus with differing levels of faculty and/or department input. Factors limiting the spread of evidence-based teaching practices have been found to include difficulty in making changes to one section of a multi-section course, lack of alignment between teaching for understanding and exams designed for quick grading, student resistance to a conceptual approach, course enrollments that make active learning more difficult, and heavy reliance on student evaluation for assessing faculty. Faculty and student surveys have highlighted differences in what faculty say they are doing and students perceptions of how helpful various strategies were to their learning. The faculty participating in the project have increased their efforts to help students connect concepts across courses through projects or specific problems that require the application of concepts learned in one course (e.g., calculus) to problem solving in a subsequent course (e.g., thermodynamics).

T1  - Assessment of Concept Mapping Models and Structured Content Models
AN  - 2314029796
AB  - A well–designed instructional module ensures that the subject matter content is effectively integrated with the presentation format. In other words, the instructor attempts to blend the presentation and content in theory as well as practice. In reality, the instructor should assume the role of a facilitator and effectively utilize modern technology to experiment on innovative ideas. The ultimate objective is a delivery mechanism that can lead to new classroom instructional strategies. Researchers are also of the opinion that education in a new learning paradigm will better prepare students for the work ahead of them. Whether it be performance arts like theater and music, or be it a laboratory setting like physics or biology, student performance can be effectively accentuated by adopting creative instructional lesson plans. Furthermore, many of our educational institutions have tried to move away from emphasizing the establishment of a strong knowledge-base. In this paper the author discusses two models that he has successfully utilized for accentuating student performance. The first is identified as Concept Mapping Model and the second in identified as Structured Content Model. These two models are of particular interest to Ocean Engineering Courses because certain topics and subject matter can be better presented to the students by selective choice of one of these two models. In certain Ocean Engineering foundation courses it is very important to stress and cover the fundamental concepts and one has to utilize Structured Content Model. In upper level courses, however the students may benefit with the use of Concept Mapping Model because strong foundation and important concepts have already been established in lower level, elementary and basic courses.

T1  - Board 87: Design Process Geometries: Shapes and Learning Trajectories of Engineering Students’ Design Process Concept Maps
AN  - 2314026582
AB  - The research objective of this NSF-funded study is to explore and understand how open-ended, hands-on making work and activities can reflect student learning trajectories and learning gains in the product-based learning, undergraduate engineering classroom. The aim is to expand understanding of what making learning in the context of engineering design education might be and to illustrate educational pathways within the engineering education curriculum. Making is rooted in constructionism – learning by doing and constructing knowledge through that doing. Aspects of making work and activities that are unique to making that could appear in the engineering classroom or curriculum include: sharing, practical ingenuity, personal investment, playful invention, risk taking, community building and self-directed learning.
The main research questions of this work is: How do engineering students learn and apply making? What are the attributes of making in the engineering classroom? Empirical evidence of what making in the engineering classroom looks like, and how it changes over time, and how students conceptualize making through making, designerly, and engineering ways of knowing-doing-acting will come from revisiting and additional qualitative analysis of student project data collected during a product-based learning course engineering design course. To best address the research question, this proposed study proposes multiple qualitative methods to collect and analyze data on engineering students learning making. We aim to triangulate what students think they are learning, what they are being taught, and what students are demonstrating.
This work is exploratory in nature. In our approach to understanding making outside of formal engineering education, at events like Maker Faires in the Maker Community, it does seem evident that there is a lot of overlap between a making mindset and a designerly way of knowing or engineering way of knowing. In the sphere of formal engineering education however, making is regularly viewed as lesser than engineering, engineering design without the engineering science or analysis. Making is not yet valued as part of formal engineering education efforts. If making is something that can be connected to beneficial student learning and is additive to the required technical content and provides a means for students to figure out what area of problems they want to tackle in the studies and beyond, it would make for a student-centered making revolution.
This study advances the knowledge of the learning pathways of making by capturing empirical evidence of such learning trajectories. This study will advance the currently limited knowledge of learning in the making community and making in the engineering classroom.
Initial findings generated during this study describe the learning trajectories of engineers learning making. By examining the engineering student making learning experience through the lens of cognitive science and illustrating empirical making learning trajectories, this work may impact the quality of engineering design teaching. By sharing learning trajectories across multiple communities, we seek to change the conversation by illuminating pathways for a wider array of student makers to become the makers and engineers of the future.

T1  - Studying Changes using Concept Maps in First-Year Students' Understanding of the Engineering Design Process

AB  - Studying Changes using Concept Maps in First Year Students' Understanding of the Engineering Design Process
Motivation
This Complete Evidence-Based Practice paper investigates how first year students’ understanding of the engineering design process changes in a design-based Introduction to Engineering course. This fifteen-week two-credit course introduces the engineering design process and provides students with opportunities to practice applying the engineering design process. Students were engaged in a two-week conceptual team design challenge and a ten-week hands-on team design project. The goal of this work is to understand how students’ understanding of the engineering design process changes before and after engaging in these design activities.
Background
Concept maps [1] are graphical node-arc representations that depict relationships among concepts. They have been used quite extensively both as an instructional tool and an assessment tool in science and engineering classrooms. Concept mapping was chosen as the tool to evaluate students’ understanding of the engineering design process because compared to other tools, it is independent of any design project; can be easily done at the individual level; and its open-endedness requires students to internalize the knowledge, identify key concepts that are relevant, and document relationships between the concepts, demonstrating knowledge of the engineering design process at multiple levels of Bloom’s Taxonomy.
Assessment
In two sections of this course taught in the Fall 2018 semester with approximately 40 students each, students individually created visual representations in the form of concept maps to show their understanding of the engineering design process three times during the semester, once before the course started, once after the two-week design challenge and once at the end of semester after the ten-week design project. Qualitative research methods were used to analyze these concept maps. Two researchers identified themes drawn from a theoretical framework about the engineering design process. And these researchers then independently coded the data, compared and discussed discrepancies until agreement was reached to ensure inter-rater reliability.
Results
A preliminary thematic analysis of the data showed that students noted more concepts and provided specific details related to more themes in the second concept map compared to the first one. For example, about a little over 50% of the students mentioned ‘identify the problem’ in their first concept map but majority of them did not provide any details while above 90% of them mentioned ‘identify’ and/or ‘define’ in their second concept map and many provided specific details such as ‘consult customer’, ‘needs’, ‘wants’, ‘collect information about the problem’, ‘POV statements’, ‘goals’, ‘requirements’, ‘criteria’, etc.
In the full paper, specifics about the design-based Introduction to Engineering course will be described. Research aims, methods, and a complete analysis and results will also be presented and discussed.

T1  - The adventure of study: thinking with artifices in a Palestinian experimental university
AN  - 2212566835
AB  - The question concerning the relation between thinking and the university is the starting point of this paper. After a very brief outline of some reflections on this topic, the case of Campus in Camps, a Palestinian experimental university, is presented to shed light on this issue. Inspired by Isabelle Stengers' ecology of practices, it is possible to discern four requirements on thinking in the work of Campus in Camps, namely storytelling, comparing, mapping, and using. It will be argued that the particularity of thinking at the university, is that it is done via artifices that initiate processes of composition, problematization, and attention. In the concluding section, the paper proposes to understand the study practice of Campus in Camps as an adventure that activates a sense of the possible, and hence opens up futures that are different from the ones that present themselves as obvious or unavoidable.

T1  - Student strategies for categorizing IT-related terms
AN  - 2167524511
AB  - The ability to categorize concepts is an essential capability for human thinking and action. On the one hand, the investigation of such abilities is the purview of psychology; on the other hand, subject-specific educational research is also of interest, as a number of research works in the field of science education show. For computer science education, no corresponding studies are currently available. However, investigating how learners build categories from a choice of given terms may be useful for several reasons; for example, learners’ perspectives on relations between terms, as well as potential misconceptions, can be detected and made available to educators aiming to improve lesson planning. Therefore, we conducted an empirical study with 490 German students from primary to higher education, in which we presented them with 23 information technology-related terms (such as computer, Facebook, hard drive, virus) on a questionnaire, with the task of assigning these to self-defined categories (and then giving their categories individual names). In the results, we identified a number of potential categorization strategies the participants might have used to categorize the given terms; these include generalization, purpose, place of use, state, part-whole relationships, and association. Recognizing and defining such categorization strategies can help teachers construct learner-adequate concept maps of the domain, which helps foster the elaboration of learners’ knowledge structures in this field. We found that the younger participants used less abstract names for their categories, and observed that some participants had difficulty categorizing some terms (such as robot and 3D).

T1  - The Integrative Nature of Geography: Bridging the Gap in the Environmental Science Curriculum
AN  - 2576695560
AB  - A firm definition of geography is often elusive and at times, the field is criticized for borrowing heavily from other disciplines. However, this article argues that the real strength of geography is its integrative nature. The purpose of this article is to discuss geography's integrative nature and how this strength can be integrated into the undergraduate environmental science curriculum. Two brief examples are provided from the author's own teaching and research experiences. Concept mapping in an introductory environmental science class allows students to visualize the complexity and integrative nature of environmental issues. In the atmospheric science classroom, students are introduced not only to the physical processes of weather hazards, but to the social dimensions as well. It is imperative that future scientists, advocates, and decision makers learn to critically integrate across disciplines to solve the world's most pressing environmental issues.

T1  - The Use of Artificially Intelligent Self-Diagnosing Digital Platforms by the General Public: Scoping Review
AN  - 2511961515
AB  - Background: Self-diagnosis is the process of diagnosing or identifying a medical condition in oneself. Artificially intelligent digital platforms for self-diagnosis are becoming widely available and are used by the general public; however, little is known about the body of knowledge surrounding this technology.
Objective: The objectives of this scoping review were to (1) systematically map the extent and nature of the literature and topic areas pertaining to digital platforms that use computerized algorithms to provide users with a list of potential diagnoses and (2) identify key knowledge gaps.
Methods: The following databases were searched: PubMed (Medline), Scopus, Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Google Scholar, Open Grey, and ProQuest Dissertations and Theses. The search strategy was developed and refined with the assistance of a librarian and consisted of 3 main concepts: (1) self-diagnosis; (2) digital platforms; and (3) public or patients. The search generated 2536 articles from which 217 were duplicates. Following the Tricco et al 2018 checklist, 2 researchers screened the titles and abstracts (n=2316) and full texts (n=104), independently. A total of 19 articles were included for review, and data were retrieved following a data-charting form that was pretested by the research team.
Results: The included articles were mainly conducted in the United States (n=10) or the United Kingdom (n=4). Among the articles, topic areas included accuracy or correspondence with a doctor’s diagnosis (n=6), commentaries (n=2), regulation (n=3), sociological (n=2), user experience (n=2), theoretical (n=1), privacy and security (n=1), ethical (n=1), and design (n=1). Individuals who do not have access to health care and perceive to have a stigmatizing condition are more likely to use this technology. The accuracy of this technology varied substantially based on the disease examined and platform used. Women and those with higher education were more likely to choose the right diagnosis out of the potential list of diagnoses. Regulation of this technology is lacking in most parts of the world; however, they are currently under development.
Conclusions: There are prominent research gaps in the literature surrounding the use of artificially intelligent self-diagnosing digital platforms. Given the variety of digital platforms and the wide array of diseases they cover, measuring accuracy is cumbersome. More research is needed to understand the user experience and inform regulations.

T1  - Mind Mapping as a Procedural Concept in Design Learning
AN  - 2305522388
AB  - Year after year knowledge grows and the different fields of science are becoming more intertwined, interrelated and complex. This requires new teaching methodologies for students so they can learn most of these fields. The future students will then be able to learn the full scientific material so that future scientists can easily add to it. The method of mind mapping is considered one of the most important methods used to improve the teaching process which can achieve maximum potential in the recipient's understanding of the scientific content with the use of the left and the right hemisphere of the learner's brain to understand and absorb the suggested scientific material. This mind mapping strategy offers the possibility of developing concepts and their links and its classifications in the right categories which saves time and effort to the learner. The results of a survey for a group of academic and Masters and PHD's students came out positive on whether they prefer using the mind mapping strategy in teaching design in all stages of education (bachelor, masters and doctorate) for its time and effort saving, especially for students of Design and engineering colleges who deals with colors and pictures. Furthermore, the technical construction during the educational stages of these students within these colleges makes them highly capable of understanding the concepts and relationships in the way of the mind mapping s. The problem of research resides in the difficulties most professors, even those who have years of experience, face when it comes to their students' understanding of some materials; some students are slow to absorb some of the contents of the lesson, especially those which are filled with information. The solution is to reduce the amount of information in the lecture, or to divide it. The purpose of the research is to determine the compatibility of the mind mapping method with the absorption capacity of Design and engineering courses along with determining the extent of its efficiency in the different educational stages? Also, the research asks questions such as: What are the reasons learners prefer to use mind mapping as strategy? Is it the habit of dealing with colors and images behind the preference of the sample in the way of mind mapping? Or the interest in the practical applications more than the theoretical part of the courses? What is the effect of the technical skills of Design and engineering students majors in their ability to understand the shapes and images used in the method of mind mapping, through the surveys and analytical and the work of surveys.

T1  - Design for the Soul of the Community Using Community-based Design Principles
AN  - 2233363584
AB  - The X State University Community Playground Project (XSUCPP) employs community-based design techniques in which college students in biological engineering work with local constituents, especially children, to design and build playgrounds that reflect the unique aspects of the community which the playground will serve. In developing a community-based design process, members of XSUCPP realized that there is a dearth of literature in this area. Therefore, members sought to develop an initial set of community-based design principles and best practices that engineering practitioners could use in their own community-based design endeavors. The team completed brainstorming and concept mapping exercises using a combination of individual and group techniques to create an initial set of community-based design principles, presented here. The XSUCPP members believe that each of these principles supports the overall goal of community-based design: to express “the Soul of the Community” through co-created artifacts.

T1  - Engine oil degradation analysis of construction equipment in Latin America
TT  - Engine oil degradation analysis
AN  - 2212714865
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to determine and describe the effect of oil degradation on the engine of a 20-ton class excavator operating in Latin America.Design/methodology/approachThe research parameters include: a specific engine class and equipment, the John Deere PowerTech Plus 6068 Tier 3 diesel engine that powers the 20-ton class excavator; identical OSA3 oil analysis laboratory equipment in 11 target countries in Latin America was employed to analyze oil samples; and the same sampling scope and method were followed for each oil sample.FindingsThe research results indicated that at 500 h of use, 73.4 percent of the oil sample results indicated that soot accumulation was a significant problem. When associating the engine oil contamination with the environment risk drivers: altitude and diesel quality have the greatest impact on iron readings; bio-diesel impacts copper; and precipitation and poor diesel quality are associated with silicon levels.Practical implicationsDue to diverse machine operating conditions, research offers an accurate global representation. Because there is an exponential count of particles as oil use approaches 250 h, the interval of engine maintenance (oil change) for machinery operating under similar conditions should not exceed 250 h of use.Originality/valueThe main contribution of this paper will help machinery final users and manufacturers to implement mitigation strategies to improve engine durability in countries with similar operating conditions.

T1  - Adverse Childhood Experiences: Concept Mapping in the Bachelor of Science in Nursing Curriculum
AN  - 2202376829
AB  - Background:
Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have deleterious effects on health across the lifespan. Educating health professionals for ACEs awareness and prevention facilitates quality care. Literature documents concept mapping as an effective teaching strategy used in health professions to stimulate learning and foster students' critical thinking. However, ACEs curricular concept mapping remains unexplored.
Method:
Content analysis with manifest coding was used to identify key concepts based on faculty narratives and discussion notes about ACEs content.
Results:
Major and minor themes emerged to support the ACEs Curricular Concept Map development with direct and indirect paths to culture of health and health equity.
Conclusions:
The ACEs Curricular Concept Map was developed to guide teaching ACEs knowledge in a Bachelor of Science in Nursing program. Future studies are needed to evaluate the impact of ACEs curricular concepts on nursing students' learning and graduates' ability to translate knowledge to practice ACEs awareness and prevention toward health equity for all.

T1  - College students’ use of self-generated tagclouds for knowledge integration: evidence from reflections
AN  - 2104460116
AB  - Student-generated tagclouds provided an intuitive overview of a group of learners’ collective knowledge. Although such tagclouds may have the potential to be used as effective learning tools, it has not been clear how students use this tool for knowledge construction. In this paper, we report a two-stage study that investigated college students’ experiences of using tagclouds for developing their domain knowledge, culminating in individual concept maps and research papers. Based on the results of the qualitative analyses of students’ reflections from the first stage, an intervention was introduced: group discussions on tagclouds generated from different groups. The result of Study Stage II showed that group discussions highlighted the utility of the tagclouds. Treatment group participants were more likely to use tagclouds as metacognitive strategies for planning, searching, retrieving, and organizing their learning. The two-stage study also underscored the importance of collecting students’ reflections earlier in the learning process when introducing a new technology tool to promote learning.

T1  - Pre-Service Teachers’ Knowledge of Relational Structure of Physics Concepts: Finding Key Concepts of Electricity and Magnetism
AN  - 2309541702
AB  - Relational interlinked dependencies between concepts constitute the structure of abstract knowledge and are crucial in learning conceptual knowledge and the meaning of concepts. To explore pre-service teachers’ declarative knowledge of physics concepts, we have analyzed concept networks, which agglomerate 12 pre-service teacher students’ representations of the key elements in electricity and magnetism. We show that by using network-based methods, the interlinked connections of nodes, locally and globally, can be analyzed to reveal how different elements of the network are supported through their connections to other nodes in the network. Nodes with high global connectivity initialize contiguous concept patchworks within the network and are thus most often found to be abstract, general, and advanced concepts. Locally cohesive concepts, on the other hand, are nearly always auxiliary supporting concepts, related to specific textbook-type experiments and model-type conceptional elements. Comparisons of group-level knowledge and individual pre-service teacher students’ knowledge in the form of networks shows that while in group-level the aggregated knowledge is expert-like, at the individual level pre-service teacher students possess only a fraction of that knowledge.

T1  - 69 Empirical ethics and palliative care: a systematic review of the ethical challenges identified by specialist palliative care practitioners in their day-to-day clinical practice
AN  - 2194484479
AB  - BackgroundEthical issues arise daily in the delivery of palliative care. Despite much (largely theoretical) literature on the ethics of palliative care, evidence from specialist palliative care practitioners (SPCPs) about the day-to-day ethical challenges they encounter has not previously been synthesised. This evidence is crucial to inform education and training, and support staff.AimTo synthesise the evidence regarding the ethical challenges which SPCPs of all professional backgrounds encounter during clinical practice.MethodsA prospectively registered systematic literature review using narrative synthesis methodology (Popay et al 2006) was conducted. Key words and subject headings of 8 databases (MEDLINE, Philosopher’s Index, EMBASE, PsycINFO, LILACS, WHOLIS, Web of Science and CINAHL) were searched on 03/10/2018, without time limits. Eligible papers reported original research using inductive methods to describe SPCP-reported ethical challenges, in any language. Quality was dual assessed using the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool. Tabulation, textural description, concept mapping and thematic analysis were used to develop and present the narrative.Results7040 records were screened. 12 studies from 9 countries were included. All included studies examined adult care. A broad range of ethical challenges were identified in 5 themes: patient-related (e.g. autonomy, truth-telling), patient-family relationship (e.g. boundaries of confidentiality, family-patient conflict), clinical issues (e.g. futility, palliative sedation), organisational factors (e.g. value differences between professions and care settings, place of care), and wider system (e.g. euthanasia, organ donation).ConclusionSPCPs encounter a broad range of ethical challenges, not all of which are recognised in the ethics literature or form part of training curricula. In particular, the challenges of differing value positions between hospice and curative sectors and genetics ethics seldom occur in theoretical discussions of palliative care ethics or training, while withdrawal of life-prolonging treatment and euthanasia are more commonly represented. Findings of the review can inform SPCP ethics education, training and support.

T1  - Future Physics Learning Materials Based on STEM Education: Analysis of Teachers and Students Perceptions
AN  - 2565340980
AB  - Lately the industrial revolution era 4.0 has become a discourse in various fields. One of them is education. The education sector is the front guard of the country. In the field of education, there needs to be a plan that is structured in the making of teaching materials because teaching materials are the main learning for students. This study aims to describe and analyze teachers and students on the national curriculum teaching materials based on Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). The study was involving grade XI 233 senior high school students and 3 physics teachers. The method is used in this study with sequential explanatory. The research instrument used questionnaires, interviews and Focus Group Discussions (FGD). The results showed that to support STEM learning in national curriculum needed teaching materials to include lesson plans, books, animation, stimulation, and video. Components of book teaching materials include core competencies, basic competencies, indicators, objectives, concept maps, pictures, videos, animations, material that is explained in detail in each chapter, detailed discussion, internet links, summaries, and questions. The video components include core competencies, basic competencies, goals, indicators, abducting, using everyday language, complete materials and easy to understand. The material needed to develop teaching materials in physics between stationary waves, dynamic and static electricity, temperature and heat and Newton law. All teaching materials are expected to be based on e-learning or mobile learning. In the national curriculum, the teacher has not started STEM-based teaching materials. So in the future, there needs to be the development of STEM-based teaching materials to support the national curriculum that is designed to the maximum.

T1  - Global Sensitivity Analysis of Leaf-Canopy-Atmosphere RTMs: Implications for Biophysical Variables Retrieval from Top-of-Atmosphere Radiance Data
AN  - 2301953564
AB  - Knowledge of key variables driving the top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiance over a vegetated surface is an important step to derive biophysical variables from TOA radiance data, e.g., as observed by an optical satellite. Coupled leaf-canopy-atmosphere Radiative Transfer Models (RTMs) allow linking vegetation variables directly to the at-sensor TOA radiance measured. Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA) of RTMs enables the computation of the total contribution of each input variable to the output variance. We determined the impacts of the leaf-canopy-atmosphere variables into TOA radiance using the GSA to gain insights into retrievable variables. The leaf and canopy RTM PROSAIL was coupled with the atmospheric RTM MODTRAN5. Because of MODTRAN’s computational burden and GSA’s demand for many simulations, we first developed a surrogate statistical learning model, i.e., an emulator, that allows approximating RTM outputs through a machine learning algorithm with low computation time. A Gaussian process regression (GPR) emulator was used to reproduce lookup tables of TOA radiance as a function of 12 input variables with relative errors of 2.4%. GSA total sensitivity results quantified the driving variables of emulated TOA radiance along the 400–2500 nm spectral range at 15 cm−1(between 0.3–9 nm); overall, the vegetation variables play a more dominant role than atmospheric variables. This suggests the possibility to retrieve biophysical variables directly from at-sensor TOA radiance data. Particularly promising are leaf chlorophyll content, leaf water thickness and leaf area index, as these variables are the most important drivers in governing TOA radiance outside the water absorption regions. A software framework was developed to facilitate the development of retrieval models from at-sensor TOA radiance data. As a proof of concept, maps of these biophysical variables have been generated for both TOA (L1C) and bottom-of-atmosphere (L2A) Sentinel-2 data by means of a hybrid retrieval scheme, i.e., training GPR retrieval algorithms using the RTM simulations. Obtained maps from L1C vs L2A data are consistent, suggesting that vegetation properties can be directly retrieved from TOA radiance data given a cloud-free sky, thus without the need of an atmospheric correction.

T1  - Data model harmonization for the All Of Us Research Program: Transforming i2b2 data into the OMOP common data model
AN  - 2184387064
AB  - Background 
The All Of Us Research Program (AOU) is building a nationwide cohort of one million patients’ EHR and genomic data. Data interoperability is paramount to the program’s success. AOU is standardizing its EHR data around the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) data model. OMOP is one of several standard data models presently used in national-scale initiatives. Each model is unique enough to make interoperability difficult. The i2b2 data warehousing and analytics platform is used at over 200 sites worldwide, which uses a flexible ontology-driven approach for data storage. We previously demonstrated this ontology system can drive data reconfiguration, to transform data into new formats without site-specific programming. We previously implemented this on our 12-site Accessible Research Commons for Health (ARCH) network to transform i2b2 into the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network model.
 Methods and results 
Here, we leverage our investment in i2b2 high-performance transformations to support the AOU OMOP data pipeline. Because the ARCH ontology has gained widespread national interest (through the Accrual to Clinical Trials network, other PCORnet networks, and the Nebraska Lexicon), we leveraged sites’ existing investments into this standard ontology. We developed an i2b2-to-OMOP transformation, driven by the ARCH-OMOP ontology and the OMOP concept mapping dictionary. We demonstrated and validated our approach in the AOU New England HPO (NEHPO). First, we transformed into OMOP a fake patient dataset in i2b2 and verified through AOU tools that the data was structurally compliant with OMOP. We then transformed a subset of data in the Partners Healthcare data warehouse into OMOP. We developed a checklist of assessments to ensure the transformed data had self-integrity (e.g., the distributions have an expected shape and required fields are populated), using OMOP’s visual Achilles data quality tool. This i2b2-to-OMOP transformation is being used to send NEHPO production data to AOU. It is open-source and ready for use by other research projects.

T1  - Assessing Participant Group Affiliation and Attitudes Towards CTSI Services
AN  - 2184345421
AB  - Analyzing open-ended survey text responses holds the capacity to yield greater insight about participants' perceptions of clinical translational science institute (CTSI) initiatives. Few translational research studies have explored their effectiveness. The aim of this mixed methods analysis was to assess participant perspectives of the impact and effectiveness of our CTSI program and services. We selected two open-ended survey question items (how CTSI benefitted research, and the most important impact of the research facilitated by the CTSI) from a larger set and compared responses by participant affiliations (clinical/non-clinical; lab/non-lab). We used a three-step analysis. First, nodes were generated using NVivo word frequency function. Next, with the aid of Python, we used sentiment analysis to classify each node (as positive, negative, or neutral) to indicate participant ratings toward their experiences with the CTSI and computed the average differences between groups. Third, we selected nodes that met pre-established criteria and report the qualitative distinctions. We recommend using precisely worded open-ended questions in future annual surveys or administering a survey using only opened-ended questions every six months.

T1  - A Concept Map of Evolutionary Biology to Promote Meaningful Learning in Biology
AN  - 2183666654
AB  - Is it possible to teach biology without mentioning evolution? The answer is yes, but it is not possible for students to understand biology without the evolutionary context on which the meaning and intellectual value of biological concepts depend. Meaningful learning of evolution requires (1) that the students incorporate new knowledge into a cognitive structure linked with higher-order concepts; (2) a well-organized knowledge structure; and (3) a positive emotional attachment and identification (affective commitment) to the subject by the learner. Concept maps are useful tools in meaningful learning. We present a concept map that organizes concepts of history of life and the processes that generate it, and the hierarchical relationships among them. Biological evolution is a compelling account of life on Earth and of human origins. It constitutes a unifying explanatory framework that can generate a powerful affective commitment to the subject. The concept map provided here is tied to the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS).

T1  - Facilitators to support the implementation of injury prevention training in youth handball: A concept mapping approach
AN  - 2167264792
AB  - There is a need for research to identify effective implementation strategies for injury prevention training within real‐world community sports. The aim of this ecological participatory study was to identify facilitators, among stakeholders at multiple levels, that could help injury prevention training become part of regular training routines in youth team handball. Concept mapping, a mixed‐method approach for qualitative data collection and quantitative data analysis, was used. Stakeholders (n = 196) of two community team handball clubs (29% players, 13% coaches, 38% caregivers, 11% club, district and national handball administrators, 9% unknown) participated in a brainstorming process. After the research team synthesized the 235 generated statements, 50 stakeholders (34% players, 22% coaches, 24% caregivers, 20% administrators) sorted 89 unique facilitator statements into clusters and rated them for importance and feasibility. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis yielded five clusters (stress value 0.231): “Understanding and applying knowledge,” “Education, knowledge, and consistency,” “Set‐up and exercises,” “Inspiration, motivation, and routines,” and “Club policy and expert collaboration.” The cluster “Understanding and applying knowledge” had the highest mean importance (3.17 out of 4) and feasibility (2.93) ratings. The 32 statements rated as both highly important and feasible (Go‐zone) indicate action is required at the individual (end‐users) and organizational (policymakers) levels to implement injury prevention training. Results suggest that developing evidence‐based context‐specific injury prevention training, incorporating physiological, biomechanical and psychological components, and an associated context‐specific implementation plan in partnership with all stakeholders should be a high priority to facilitate the implementation of injury prevention training in youth team handball.

T1  - Applications of Pathfinder Network scaling for identifying an optimal use of first language for second language science reading comprehension
AN  - 2053205369
AB  - Previous research has shown that the knowledge structure (KS) complexity of a first language (L1) under certain conditions can strongly influence the KS complexity established in a second language (L2), and then this more complex L2 KS reciprocally influences L2 text comprehension. This present experimental investigation seeks to identify the unique contributions of mapping and writing in L1 (Korean) tasks to support L2 (English) science text comprehension using Pathfinder Network scaling, a graph-theoretic cognitive science approach. Native Korean low proficiency English language learners (n = 245) read a 708-word English (L2) science lesson text, completed one of seven treatment conditions, and then completed a comprehension posttest. The seven conditions consisted of three experimental conditions that required different L1 tasks including: L1 mapping alone, L1 writing alone, or both L1 mapping and writing; and four control conditions that did not receive any L1 treatment: L2 mapping alone, L2 writing alone, both L2 mapping and writing, or reading only. All of the maps and writing artifacts were converted into Pathfinder Networks that were compared to an expert’s referent network. Results show that requiring L1 lesson tasks relatively increases L2 KS complexity and concomitant comprehension posttest performance. In order of effectiveness, combined L1 mapping and writing was most effective for posttest comprehension, then L1 writing, and least effective is L1 mapping alone. These findings confirm and extend the earlier findings that the inherent L1 KS complexity can strongly influence L2 KS complexity. Educationally, requiring L1 tasks, especially in text translation, likely engenders richer L2 structure that supports higher-order understanding of the text. Also, these findings further validate this technology-based approach for measuring KS contained in bilingual learners’ productions.

T1  - Computer-Based Concept Mapping as a Method for Enhancing the Effectiveness of Concept Learning in Technology-Enhanced Learning
AN  - 2574328042
AB  - Technology enhanced learning is a wide area that covers all uses of digital technology to support learning and teaching activities. The computer-based concept mapping has shown potential in enhancing meaningful learning in education. Concept mapping is an important tool that is used in the field of education to help students in understanding the basic concepts and the relationships between them. This research proposes a computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) environment combined with Google classroom to help students reduce their misconceptions and to improve their problem solving skills. Furthermore, it examines the effect of CBCM on the sustainability of concept learning according to student views. The participants were first-year engineering students. The study was conducted in a physics class, and a true-experimental design was used. The experimental group students learned with the Google classroom combined with computer-based concept mapping (CBCM), while the concept group students learned with Google classroom and the traditional method. Data were collected from a physics concept test, problem solving inventory, and semi-structured interviews. The research results indicated that teaching in the CBCM environment combined with Google Classroom provides meaningful learning by correcting the misconceptions of the students. Moreover, there was a significant increase in the problem solving skills of the experimental group as compared to the control group. According to the students’ views, it was determined that CBCM enhances the sustainability of concept learning. The results of this study can help educators and researchers to integrate computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) techniques into Google Classroom.

T1  - SUSTAINABLE LEARNING AND MATERIAL DEVELPMENT IN ESP - ENGLISH FOR THE LIFE SCIENCES
AN  - 2555372989
AB  - The paper presents the follow-up of a case study investigation with students of ESP (English for Specific Purposes) on a tertiary level (1st and 4th year students), consisting of collaborative learner-teacher activities, including concept mapping and content-based learning. The results of our project in progress are considered for an optimal adaptation of an ESP textbook which is intended for students in several areas related to the Life Sciences (Agriculture, Biotechnologies, Biology, Genetic Engineering, Horticulture, etc.). The framework of the course support we propose, as well as our methodology and tool kit are provided by ecolinguistics and the aim is achieving ecological learning and meaningful communication in the language class and beyond. The object of this exploratory study is to highlight the potential of collaborative learning environments, to enable students to employ conceptual mapping and find relations between significant concepts in the Life Sciences. The feedback was collected from ESP learners as materials were collaboratively selected and designed together with students, based on the construction of conceptual maps. The question raised in our preliminary study draws on a review of the literature pertinent to meaningful conceptual learning. Some of the key concepts addressed in the ecologically-designed English courses are analysed, focusing on feedback from the students and constantly adapting our findings to better serve their needs.

T1  - Scaffolding a collaborative process through concept mapping: a case study on faculty development
AN  - 2506898247
AB  - PurposeConcept maps have been described as a valuable tool for exploring curriculum knowledge. However, less attention has been given to the use of them to visualise contested and tacit knowledge, i.e. the values and perceptions of teachers that underpin their practice. This paper aims to explore the use of concept mapping to uncover academics’ views and help them articulate their perspectives within the framework provided by the concepts of pedagogic frailty and resilience in a collaborative environment.Design/methodology/approachParticipants were a group of five colleagues within a Biochemical Science Department, working on the development of a new undergraduate curriculum. A qualitative single-case study was conducted to get some insights on how concept mapping might scaffold each step of the collaborative process. They answered the online questionnaire; their answers were “translated” into an initial expert-constructed concept map, which was offered as a starting point to articulate their views during a group session, resulting in a consensus map.FindingsEngaging with the questionnaire was useful for providing the participants with an example of an “excellent” map, sensitising them to the core concepts and the possible links between them, without imposing a high level of cognitive load. This fostered dialogue of complex ideas, introducing the potential benefits of consensus maps in team-based projects.Originality/valueAn online questionnaire may facilitate the application of the pedagogic frailty model for academic development by scaling up the mapping process. The map-mediated facilitation of dialogue within teams of academics may facilitate faculty development by making explicit the underpinning values held by team members.

T1  - Finding the Intersection of Neuroplasticity, Stroke Recovery, and Learning: Scope and Contributions to Stroke Rehabilitation
AN  - 2407661271
AB  - Aim. Neural plastic changes are experience and learning dependent, yet exploiting this knowledge to enhance clinical outcomes after stroke is in its infancy. Our aim was to search the available evidence for the core concepts of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning; identify links between these concepts; and identify and review the themes that best characterise the intersection of these three concepts. Methods. We developed a novel approach to identify the common research topics among the three areas: neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning. A concept map was created a priori, and separate searches were conducted for each concept. The methodology involved three main phases: data collection and filtering, development of a clinical vocabulary, and the development of an automatic clinical text processing engine to aid the process and identify the unique and common topics. The common themes from the intersection of the three concepts were identified. These were then reviewed, with particular reference to the top 30 articles identified as intersecting these concepts. Results. The search of the three concepts separately yielded 405,636 publications. Publications were filtered to include only human studies, generating 263,751 publications related to the concepts of neuroplasticity (n=6,498), stroke recovery (n=79,060), and learning (n=178,193). A cluster concept map (network graph) was generated from the results; indicating the concept nodes, strength of link between nodes, and the intersection between all three concepts. We identified 23 common themes (topics) and the top 30 articles that best represent the intersecting themes. A time-linked pattern emerged. Discussion and Conclusions. Our novel approach developed for this review allowed the identification of the common themes/topics that intersect the concepts of neuroplasticity, stroke recovery, and learning. These may be synthesised to advance a neuroscience-informed approach to stroke rehabilitation. We also identified gaps in available literature using this approach. These may help guide future targeted research.

T1  - Cognitive Structures and Misconceptions with Thematic Framework: The Case of Chemical Bonding
AN  - 2362125582
AB  - This study aims to investigate undergraduate students' cognitive structures and determinate misconceptions about chemical bonding phenomena. On the other hand, the study achieves to recommend an alternative technique for the evaluation of Word Associations Tests (WAT). The study was carried out with the participation of first year studens; 141 from engineering faculty and 73 from medical sciences faculty of a foundation university in the spring semester of 2017-2018 academic year. WAT about chemical bonds prepared by the researchers was used as a data collection tool. Content analysis were used to analyze the data. The students' responds to the key words given to them were divided into themes and cut-off technique was used according to the themes distinguished. In this context, students' cognitive structures related to chemical bonds were determined within the framework of themes. It has been determined that the students' WAT results regarding to chemical bonding, which supported with concept maps within the framework of the themes, provides convenience in determining the misconceptions because of reflects the concepts and the relationships between the concepts more clearly. In consequence, it is suggested that the new technique of evaluation recommended could be used in prospective studies.Alternate abstract:Bu çalışmanın amacı, lisans öğrencilerinin kimyasal bağ fenomeni ile ilgili bilişsel yapılarının incelenmesi ve kavram yanılgılarının belirlenmesidir. Bunun yanında çalışma kelime ilişkilendirme testlerinin (KIT) değerlendirilmesi için alternatif bir teknik önermeyi de hedeflemektedir. Çalışma, 2017-2018 bahar döneminde bir vakıf üniversitesinin, 141 mühendislik fakültesi ve 73 sağlık bilimleri fakültesi öğrencisi ile yürütülmüştür. Veri toplama aracı olarak araştırmacılar tarafından hazırlanmış, kimyasal bağlar konusu ile ilgili kelime ilişkilendirme testi kullanılmıştır. Verilerin analizinde içerik analizi kullanılmıştır. Öğrencilerin bilişsel yapılarının ve kavram yanılgılarının ortaya çıkartılmasında, verilen anahtar kelimelere ilişkin öğrenciler tarafından verilen yanıtlar, temalar oluşturularak gruplandırılmış ve KIT değerlendirilmesi için bu tematik çerçeveye göre kesme yöntemi kullanılmıştır. Bu bağlamda öğrencilerin kimyasal bağlar konusu ile ilgili bilişsel yapıları temalar çerçevesinde belirlenmiştir. Öğrencilerin kimyasal bağlar konusu ile ilgili KIT sonuçlarının belirlenen temalar çerçevesinde kavram haritalarıyla desteklenmesi, kavramları ve kavramlar arası ilişkileri daha net bir şekilde yansıttığı için kavram yanılgılarının belirlenmesinde kolaylık sağladığı belirlenmiştir. Çalışma sonucunda, KIT için sunulan yeni değerlendirme tekniğinin diğer araştırmalarda da kullanılabileceği düşünülmektedir.

T1  - Effects of Integrating a Personalization Mechanism into the Flipped Learning Approach on Students' Learning Achievement and Behaviors
AN  - 2357261249
AB  - Conference Title: 2019 8th International Congress on Advanced Applied Informatics (IIAI-AAI)Conference Start Date:  2019,  July  7 Conference End Date:  2019,  July  11 Conference Location: Toyama, JapanIn recent years, the flipped learning teaching model has attracted much attention. To ensure that students participate in the activities of watching instructional videos at home, it is important to design an efficient learning strategy for students to learn at home and in class. In this study, we integrate the personalization mechanism into a flipped learning "Computer Science" course (n = 138) to improve students' engagement and learning achievements. Moreover, some studies have indicated that concept maps can help students to construct their knowledge. When students learn difficult chapters of Computer Science, they need to understand the structure. Therefore, after they have finished their personalization mechanism flipped learning, they have to draw a concept map of what they have learned on the system. More importantly, the personalization mechanism flipped learning system can record students' learning behavior and analyze it. Using the system records, we can investigate the different behaviors of the experimental group and the control group.

This study developed an extended open-ended concept map to enhance meaningful learning through two phases of concept map construction that calls Extended Scratch-Build (ESB). The study included software development process, experimental use, and results analysis. The functionality test showed that this learning support application could run properly. We examined that the proposed design of the ESB concept map can enhance meaningful learning. The experimental results also indicated that the ESB concept map had a significant impact on learners' knowledge understanding, which was represented by using the paired t-test statistical analysis on the pre-test and post-test scores.

T1  - Case-Based Group Learning Using Concept Maps to Achieve Multiple Educational Objectives and Behavioral Outcomes
AN  - 2348202592
AB  - Knowledge integration is an important aspect of education. In clinical education, there is an emphasis on the integration of basic medical science with clinical practice to provide a higher order of comprehension for future physicians. Also of importance in medical education is the promotion and development of professional behaviors (i.e., teamwork and interpersonal professional behavior). We set out to design and implement a weekly, 2 hour educational active learning activity for first-year preclinical medical students to foster knowledge integration and to promote professional development. As part of our case-based curriculum, we used a small-group active-learning approach involving 3 stages: concept mapping, student peer-review, and student group evaluation. Specific learning objectives and behavioral outcomes were designed to focus the learning activities. Rubrics were designed to (1) assess learners’ group generated concept maps, (2) determine effective student peer review, and (3) appropriate evaluation of group dynamics. In addition to assessment data from the rubrics, course evaluations from participating students were collected. Analysis of rubric assessments and student evaluation data confirmed that there was significant statistical achievement in critical thinking and teamwork among students. Furthermore, when analyzing concept mapping scores between the first and last case, the data displayed significant statistical improvement supporting that student groups were further integrating basic science and clinical concepts. Our concept map-based active-learning approach achieved our designated objectives and outcomes.

T1  - On the Compare of Evaluation of Deep Learning in Education
AN  - 2330025346
AB  - Conference Title: 2019 IEEE International Conference on Computer Science and Educational Informatization (CSEI)Conference Start Date:  2019,  Aug.  16 Conference End Date:  2019,  Aug.  19 Conference Location: Kunming, ChinaDeep learning is necessary for learners to resolve problems in life because deep learning can promote learners' high thinking ability and learners need such a kind of ability to solve problems. However, the research on deep learning is much less, let alone to research on the evaluation of deep learning according to research on literatures in CNKI database. Evaluation is very important for learners to improve their learning. In the paper, based on literature analysis and content analysis, we sorts out the evaluation methods of deep learning and then classifies them according to their characteristic, which include scale evaluation, project evaluation, wearable device and concept map. After the horizontal and longitudinal comparison of evaluation methods of the deep learning, we draw the following conclusions: multiple methods should be adopted on evaluation learning; the evaluation tools should be selected according to evaluation scope and learners' needs.

T1  - The Role of Social Media Applications and Hook-up Culture Among Black College-aged Men Who Have Sex with (MSM): Examining Health Outcomes
AN  - 2322130908
AB  - BACKGROUND:  The changing nature of sexual hookup encounters has marked an unprecedented shift in sexual norms.  There have been a plethora of studies that examine the prevalence of hook- up encounters and the devastating physiological, emotional, and sexual health effects among college-aged gay black men.
PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to examine the role of hooking up using social media applications such as Jack’d, Grindr, and Tinder and the role they play in sexual health outcomes among college-aged black men who have sex with men (MSM). Special attention will focus on hook-up culture among black college-aged MSM. Barriers and areas of opportunity for health promotion activities and improved outcomes among this understudied population were examined and will be used to improve health outcomes among this priority population.
METHODS: This study used qualitative research methods to collect information about hook-up culture among black college-aged men who have sex with men (MSM). Seventeen semi-structured interviews were conducted with black gay and MSM participants in Florida.  A grounded theory approach was used to theory-build, rather than theory-test. Data were transcribed and analyzed using QSR NVIVO™ 12 plus. The transcripts were reviewed by two individuals to ensure the maintenance of inter-rater reliability and validity during the coding process. Codes and themes were gathered from all interviews and concept mapped to formulate a model.
 RESULTS: Results of this study depict the intricate nature of using social media apps such as Jackd, Grindr, and Tinder among gay black men. Six themes emerged shedding light on the complexities of hook-up culture, and social media applications. A model was formulated specifying several aspects of the interwoven connection between overall hook-up experiences, which are determined by positive or negative experiences. These experiences affect the perception of hook-up experiences, psychological aspects of hooking up, and sexual risk-taking during hook-up encounters.
CONCLUSION:   Using a grounded theory approach allowed for an understanding of hook-up experiences among gay black men and factors that influence these experiences. Understanding hook-up culture among gay black men could aid in the development of interventions that take into account the myriad of issues black gay men faces while using these applications.

T1  - Using immersive and modelling environments to build scientific capacity in primary preservice teacher education
AN  - 2311060899
AB  - Research has shown that primary school teachers often have a poor background in science and scientific concepts, and as a consequence may feel particularly under-prepared to teach science. This study examines the effect of an intervention that investigated the knowledge and understanding of science concepts for a group of 8 first-year preservice primary teachers. The intervention consisted of engaging the participants using two technology-based resources: Omosa, a 3D game-like virtual learning environment (VLE), and Omosa NetLogo, a simulation/modelling environment. A small-N study design was used in this study to determine whether or not the intervention resulted in improving preservice teachers’ science content knowledge. Data sources included semi-structured interviews and concept maps. Overall, the findings suggest that the combination of the immersive and modelling environments facilitated and provided appropriate knowledge-building opportunities for participants by supporting their cognitive engagement.

T1  - Illuminating Social Justice in the Framework: Transformative Methodology, Concept Mapping, and Learning Outcomes Development for Critical Information Literacy
AN  - 2307371263
AB  - The intentional omission of learning outcomes from the ACRL Framework for Information Literacy in Higher Education has caused concern and criticism from some librarians; however, the call to action within the Framework to locally develop learning outcomes is an opportunity to illuminate the social justice, critical thinking, and higher order thinking elements of information literacy. This study applies the transformative research paradigm using the methodology of concept mapping to test the development of learning outcomes for one of the frames. Concept mapping is a mixed-methods approach and includes focus groups, hierarchical cluster analysis, and multidimensional scaling. The methodology has been used extensively in the social sciences but has limited representation in the LIS literature. Though the study provides learning outcomes developed by a small participant group following the concept mapping method, the results demonstrate the viability of this methodology for librarians seeking a new approach to locally develop learning outcomes.

T1  - Application of Concept Map in the Study of Computational Thinking Training
AN  - 2295668529
AB  - Conference Title: 2019 14th International Conference on Computer Science & Education (ICCSE)Conference Start Date:  2019,  Aug.  19 Conference End Date:  2019,  Aug.  21 Conference Location: Toronto, ON, CanadaThe call for innovative talents in the information age is imminent. With the promulgation of the domestic high school information technology curriculum standards in 2017, the formulation and positioning requirements of the core literacy of the disciplines, computational thinking as one of the four core literacy, is the thinking ability that everyone should have. Many foreign educational practice studies have shown that mind mapping can effectively promote students’ cognitive development and knowledge construction. However, the domestic educational application research is relatively lacking in this aspect, and there is little research on the comprehensive and in-depth combination of it and the core literacy “computational thinking” of the specific information technology discipline. To this end, based on the research status at home and abroad, this paper attempts to use the concept map tool to represent several important functions of computational thinking, "definition of problems", "abstract function", "build model" and "Debugging and improvement". The diagram incorporates the teaching model in the computational thinking development curriculum. This study used quasi-experimental research methods to explore the effect of conceptual map tools on students’ computational thinking. The research results show that this teaching method has a significant effect on the development of students’ computational thinking.

T1  - Reducing Cognitive Load During Closed Concept Map Construction and Consequences on Reading Comprehension and Retention
AN  - 2293973545
AB  - Computer-assisted concept map building from provided pieces by using Kit-build is an activity which can promote comprehension and retention. However, users are burdened with searching for pieces and organizing the layout, which are believed to increase the overall cognitive load of the activity. In this paper, we describe the Airmap interface, which uses automatic layout management and spatial separation to improve cognitive load during concept map building. Two experiments were done in which participants ($N= 60, N=50$) built a map after reading a text. Results show that Airmap is successful in reducing cognitive load without significant differences in immediate reading comprehension. However, there is a significant difference in performance after a two week retention period. Results give new insight into the retention enhancing aspects of building closed concept maps, indicating that the cognitive load reduced by the new interface is of the germane type, affecting how deep in memory users commit the information.

T1  - Anthropic Thinking about Global Climate Change
AN  - 2284626282
AB  - Climate scientists agree that a) human activity is a significant driver of recent climate change, and b) climate change is a danger to humanity. However, the general public accepts the former point, but rejects the latter. Thus, climate experts and the general public diverge in their understanding of the relationship between humans and climate change. My dissertation examines the role of intuitive patterns of thinking in public perceptions of climate change. Of specific interest is construal-based thinking: intuitive frameworks that are generally useful in the context of everyday reasoning, but can engender systematic misconceptions in other scientific domains (e.g., biology). Results revealed that one such construal—anthropic thinking—is recruited when thinking about climate change and impacts global climate change understanding and engagement. Anthropic thinking is a set of intuitive frameworks that are united in their distortion of the relationship between humans and the natural world. Among these frameworks are exceptionalist thinking (i.e., thinking that humans are exceptional to, and unique from other species) and anthropomorphic thinking (i.e., the attribution of human properties to non-human organisms). I conducted four studies to examine whether undergraduates recruit anthropic thinking in the context of global climate change, and the consequences of reliance on such patterns of thinking.Study One examined construal-based thinking about global climate change using an in-lab battery designed for this purpose. I modified sets of pre-existing measures of construal-based thinking to inquire about climate change. Of the investigated construals, participants only consistently engaged in exceptionalist thinking about climate change which tended to involve the correct belief that humans are uniquely contributing to climate change and the incorrect belief that humans are uniquely impervious to the effects of climate change. Moreover, participants performed similarly on measures of exceptionalist thinking about climate change and biology—a domain that is understood to be susceptible to such patterns of thinking.Study Two tested whether individuals spontaneously engage in construal-based thinking about climate change by investigating patterns of language used during semi-structured interviews about climate change. Of the investigated construals, participants most commonly used anthropic patterns of language to describe climate change. Anthropomorphic language was particularly common, revealing that individuals attributed human qualities (e.g., emotions, goals) to non-human organisms (e.g., the Earth, plants and animals) when discussing climate change. Interestingly, the use of such language during these interviews predicted increased understanding of climate change, suggesting that use of anthropomorphic analogies might aid understandings. Further, participants used exceptionalist language when describing both causes and effects of climate change, corroborating findings from the first study.Study Three investigated the predictive role of anthropic thinking in understanding and concern surrounding global climate change. Using a time-pressured manipulation, I encouraged individuals to either respond quickly (preventing them from using more deliberate reasoning strategies) or slowly (allowing deliberate strategies) to a set of true/false questions about climate change. Surprisingly, exceptionalist and anthropomorphic thinking only predicted climate change understanding in the time delay condition, suggesting that anthropic thinking is not readily available to influence knowledge when individuals must make responses quickly, but rather, may represent a more deliberative reasoning heuristic. Furthermore, anthropomorphic thinking was positively associated with concern about global climate change across conditions. Combined with findings from Study Two, these demonstrate that anthropic thinking could have a role in both aiding and hindering understanding and engagement with climate change.Finally, Study Four investigated whether exceptionalist thinking about climate change could be reduced by increasing the salience of conceptual connections between humans and global climate change. To do so, I used a concept-mapping task wherein individuals drew connections between human-related concepts (e.g., burning fossil fuels) and global climate change. Participants who completed concepts maps at the beginning of the battery showed decreased exceptionalist thinking about climate change causes and effects compared to those who completed concept maps at the end of the battery, suggesting that exceptionalist thinking about climate change may rest on decreased salience that humans both a) play a role in causing climate change and b) will be affected by climate change. Exceptionalist thinking also predicted decreased attribution of damage due to recent environmental disasters (e.g., hurricanes Florence and Michael) to global climate change. This demonstrates a way in which exceptionalist thinking might act as a cognitive barrier to understanding how climate change can impact humans.This body of research extends previous investigations of intuitive thinking and scientific understandings to a novel and timely domain: global climate change. Notably, these findings demonstrate that people recruit exceptionalism and anthropomorphism when thinking about climate change, and that these patterns of thinking influence their understanding and engagement with the issue. I discuss the implications of these results for education, and their potential utility in the development of interventions to improve public perceptions of climate change as well as science more broadly.

T1  - Universal design for learning-representation and science content: a pathway to expanding knowledge, understanding, and written explanations
AN  - 2271778727
AB  - The need for all students to develop a stronger ability to express their science knowledge in writing is important. In this article, the authors take you on a journey in an elementary school classroom with tools to help foster deeper learning and stronger writing skills in science content. With many students in high school required to pass end-of-semester science exams to receive a diploma, teaching writing at an early age across various content areas is an even more critical component of today's curriculum. Presenting curriculum material through multiple means (Universal Design for Learning-Representation) allows students to gain information through a learning approach that best fits the students' learning needs. The authors examine multiple means of representing science curriculum to engage students in creating detailed and comprehensive concept maps and to provide supportive scientific evidence in written explanations as they gain more content knowledge in science.

T1  - Concept map of dispositional humility among professionals in an interdisciplinary healthcare environment: qualitative synthesis
AN  - 2259023025
AB  - Background: US healthcare consumers increasingly demand more integrative medical care. Collaboration among clinicians trained in different professional disciplines and specialties may require particular character traits and/or training that focus on factors that facilitate effective collaborative work. Dispositional humility may be a factor that balances self-focused desire for recognition with other-focused professional collaboration to serve patients. The objective of this paper is to create a concept map of dispositional humility in healthcare professionals as a factor to enhance collaboration.
Methods: Articles published between 1997 and 2017 were searched using the term “dispositional humility” or titles containing “humility” AND either “leadership,” “cultural,” “religious,” “relational,” or “personality.” The abstracts were screened for relevance and full articles were located. To strengthen the scientific rigor of qualitative work by systematizing a method of concept analysis, the Walker and Avant’s eight-step concept analysis was used.
Results: Ninety-five articles were reviewed in the qualitative synthesis, including 82 full-text articles from the original search and 13 full-text articles containing the concepts “empathy,” “professionalism” or “openness” identified from references found in the 82 articles. A concept map was created after interpreting the contents of these articles.
Conclusions: Collaboration requires not only professional competency but also positive dispositional factors. Dispositional humility allows clinicians to have an accurate self-assessment, to be open to new ideas, to appreciate the contribution of others, and to develop generosity. Dispositional humility in leaders can facilitate character development of team members and create an environment characterized by fairness and equality, transparency, non-punitive consequences for reporting errors and near-misses, and a safe and encouraging environment. Nonetheless, dispositional humility must be nurtured and developed through professional training because high educational attainment, career and financial success, and busy schedules may lead to a sense of self-importance and entitlement that promotes separation of team members into hierarchies based on professional disciplines and specialties.

T1  - Creating a Course Teaching Map for STEM Courses

Concept maps are used in teaching to aid the learning process. Use of concept mapping for other purposes such as communicating course contents is not always successful for STEM courses due to complexity of subjects taught. This paper proposes a new type of maps, the course teaching map (CTM). To create a course teaching map, course elements as well as relationships between them must be represented on the map. The position of elements relative to each other is also significant. The resulting map is easy to read and convey a great deal of information, such as course learning outcomes, pre-requisite knowledge and more importantly teaching stages leading to achievement of course learning outcomes. This information and other can be easily extracted from the map even if one has little knowledge about subject.

T1  - Longitudinal assessment of the association between implementation strategy use and the uptake of hepatitis C treatment: Year 2
AN  - 2211247541
AB  - Background 
To increase the uptake of evidence-based treatments for hepatitis C (HCV), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) established the Hepatitis Innovation Team (HIT) Collaborative. Teams of providers were tasked with choosing implementation strategies to improve HCV care. The aim of the current evaluation was to assess how site-level implementation strategies were associated with HCV treatment initiation and how the use of implementation strategies and their association with HCV treatment changed over time.
 Methods 
A key HCV provider at each VA site (N = 130) was asked in two consecutive fiscal years (FYs) to complete an online survey examining the use of 73 implementation strategies organized into nine clusters as described by the Expert Recommendations for Implementing Change (ERIC) study. The number of Veterans initiating treatment for HCV, or “treatment starts,” at each site was captured using national data. Providers reported whether the use of each implementation strategy was due to the HIT Collaborative.
 Results 
Of 130 sites, 80 (62%) responded in Year 1 (FY15) and 105 (81%) responded in Year 2 (FY16). Respondents endorsed a median of 27 (IQR19–38) strategies in Year 2. The strategies significantly more likely to be chosen in Year 2 included tailoring strategies to deliver HCV care, promoting adaptability, sharing knowledge between sites, and using mass media. The total number of treatment starts was significantly positively correlated with total number of strategies endorsed in both years. In Years 1 and 2, respectively, 28 and 26 strategies were significantly associated with treatment starts; 12 strategies overlapped both years, 16 were unique to Year 1, and 14 were unique to Year 2. Strategies significantly associated with treatment starts shifted between Years 1 and 2. Pre-implementation strategies in the “training/educating,” “interactive assistance,” and “building stakeholder interrelationships” clusters were more likely to be significantly associated with treatment starts in Year 1, while strategies in the “evaluative and iterative” and “adapting and tailoring” clusters were more likely to be associated with treatment starts in Year 2. Approximately half of all strategies were attributed to the HIT Collaborative.
 Conclusions 
These results suggest that measuring implementation strategies over time is a useful way to catalog implementation of an evidence-based practice over time and across settings.

T1  - The view, brew and loo: perceptions of botanic gardens?
AN  - 2184014139
AB  - PurposeThis is an exploratory and qualitative study to consider approaches to capture, analyse and monitor perceptions from big data, to inform and contribute to place management research and practice of botanic gardens (BGs). This paper aims to address the ongoing significant threat to BGs due to funding being cut and the need to inform and develop sustainable revenue streams for their survival.Design/methodology/approachGuiding research questions for this study were: ‘What are the perceived strengths and areas for development for 2 BGs via a Leximancer Automatic Content Analysis (ACA) of TripAdvisor online reviews; and do they match BGs purpose of scientific research, conservation, display and education?’ A content analysis of 582 online reviews from 2007 to 2017 follows qualitative methodology techniques using a combination of manual and automatic text analysis (Leximancer text mining software). These approaches enabled a comparison of online TripAdvisor reviews with Likert-type or rating scale items of 1 to 5 stars.FindingsInsights revealed the use of Leximancer and TripAdvisor (or similar innovations) as tools for potential place management, place marketing communications and monitoring purposes. Predominant perceptions extracted from reviews are not concerned with documented collections of living plants for the purposes of scientific discovery, conservation, display and education. Reviews clearly focus more upon aesthetics, facilities and services, which support previous studies. Overall, reviews highlighted positive sentiments towards the BGs.Research limitations/implicationsLimitations link to limited data across two BGs, synthesis and meaning of complex perceptions, matters of subjectivity and time needed to interpret information. Implications enable insights into BG “place” gleaned from big data in the form of user-generated content and electronic Word-Of-Mouth using Leximancer; viewed as a measure alongside management action plans. Future studies could strengthen debate and action regarding the use of Leximancer, and also public perception of BGs’ core functions, importance and value. The research supports potential to monitor and transform perceptions, values and beliefs. Outcomes could eventually inform policy and generate a much-needed shift in funds and resources for BGs by highlighting their relevance and value to society.Originality/valueAn empirical and methodological contribution via peer reviewed studies of visitor perceptions via online reviews of Britain’s BGs “place” and “space” analysed with Leximancer have never been published. This study critically explores potential visitor and place management needs of BGs. Managers can make better use of big data from social media platforms/digital channels, using a novel type of data analytical software like Leximancer for strategic planning; with more informed approaches to place management, innovation and development. A key contribution of this study is this ACA methodological approach for place management.

T1  - Reflective self-study for an integrated learning approach to early childhood mathematics teacher education
AN  - 2182383889
AB  - Background: This article gives an account of what I learned through the process of a self-study research project. Self-study teacher research allows teacher educators and teachers to improve their learning, plan new pedagogies and impact students’ learning.
Aim: The aim of this self-study research was to improve my own practice in early childhood mathematics teacher education through interaction and collaboration with others, such as colleagues and students.
Setting: As a South African university-based teacher educator, I piloted an integrated learning approach (ILA) in the teaching and learning of early childhood mathematics in a selected undergraduate programme.
Methods: I began by tracking my personal development in mathematics education and in so doing was able to recognise my personal learning of mathematics as a child growing up in an African township context. I then worked with a class of 38 student teachers to create collages and concept maps to explore their understandings and experiences of ILA.
Results: Through this project, I discovered that colleagues in the role of critical friends provided essential feedback on my work in progress. I also learned that student teachers need to be equipped with knowledge and hands-on experience of how integration can take place in teaching and learning early childhood mathematics. I realised that it was essential to constantly reflect on my own personal history and my professional practice to explore new ways of teaching mathematics.
Conclusion: Teacher educators may consider engaging in self-study research that includes art-based self-study methods to reflect on their practices and see how they change for the benefit of their students and ultimately for the benefit of the learners.

T1  - Integrating implementation and user-centred design strategies to enhance the impact of health services: protocol from a concept mapping study
AN  - 2168707315
AB  - Background 
Innovative approaches are needed to maximise the uptake and sustainment of evidence-based practices in a variety of health service contexts. This protocol describes a study that will seek to characterise the potential of one such approach, user-centred design (UCD), which is an emerging field that seeks to ground the design of an innovation in information about the people who will ultimately use that innovation. The use of UCD to enhance strategies for implementation of health services, although promising, requires a multidisciplinary perspective based on a firm understanding of how experts from each discipline perceives the interrelatedness and suitability of these strategies.
 Method 
This online study will use a combination of purposive and snowball sampling to recruit a sample of implementation experts (n = 30) and UCD experts (n = 30). These participants will each complete a concept mapping task, which is a mixed-method conceptualisation technique that will allow for identification of distinct clusters of implementation and/or UCD strategies. The research team has selected a set of implementation strategies and UCD strategies that each participant will sort and rate on dimensions of importance and feasibility. Data analyses will focus on describing the sample, identifying related clusters of strategies, and examining the convergences, divergences, and potential for collaboration between implementation science and UCD.
 Discussion 
By leading to a better understanding of the overlap between implementation science and UCD, grounded within established theoretical frameworks, this study holds promise for improving the impact and sustainability of evidence-based health services in community settings.

T1  - Concept networks of students’ knowledge of relationships between physics concepts: finding key concepts and their epistemic support
AN  - 2427372222
AB  - Concept maps, which are network-like visualisations of the inter-linkages between concepts, are used in teaching and learning as representations of students’ understanding of conceptual knowledge and its relational structure. In science education, research on the uses of concept maps has focused much attention on finding methods to identify key concepts that are of the most importance either in supporting or being supported by other concepts in the network. Here we propose a method based on network analysis to examine students’ representations of the relational structure of physics concepts in the form of concept maps. We suggest how the key concepts and their epistemic support can be identified through focusing on the pathways along which the information is passed from one node to another. Towards this end, concept maps are analysed as directed and weighted networks, where nodes are concepts and links represent different types of connections between concepts, and where each link is assumed to provide epistemic support to the node it is connected to. The notion of key concept can then be operationalised through the directed flow of information from one node to another in terms of communicability between the nodes, separately for out-going and in-coming weighted links. Here we analyse a collated concept network based on a sample of 12 original concept maps constructed by university students. We show that communicability is a simple and reliable way to identify the key concepts and examine their epistemic justification within the collated network. The communicabilities of the key nodes in the collated network are compared with communicabilities averaged over the set of 12 individual concept maps. The comparison shows the collated network contains an extensive set of key concepts with good epistemic support. Every individual networks contain a sub-set of these key concepts but with a limited overlap of the sub-sets with other individual networks. The epistemically well substantiated knowledge is thus sparsely distributed over the 12 individual networks.

T1  - Comparison of German and Japanese student teachers’ views on creativity in chemistry class
AN  - 2382815968
AB  - Creativity has become an increasingly important skill in today’s rapidly changing times, as industries and economies depend upon innovation. It is therefore a requirement for school graduates, especially those who strive towards a technical or scientific career. However creativity has not been integrated into curricula of STEM subjects in many European countries including Germany. To successfully incorporate it in the classroom, it is important to investigate teachers’ and student teachers’ attitudes towards creativity, as they influence teaching and lesson planning. In cooperation with Kagoshima University, Japan, the possibility to investigate Japanese student teachers’ conceptions of creativity and compare them with those of their German colleagues became available. This is of special interest as many differences exist between Germany and Japanese, such as the culture, society and educational system as well as different rankings in PISA and TIMSS. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to investigate, compare and analyse the concepts and views of German and Japanese student teachers. To achieve this, a research instrument, including the creation of concept maps and a questionnaire have been used. In the evaluation of the data, an extensive qualitative analysis of the propositions in the concept maps and statements in the questionnaire were made. These were supported by structural and quantitative analysis. The results show that almost all the student teachers in this study had a positive attitude towards creativity, but there were differences in the understanding and implementation of creativity in the classroom.

T1  - Are We Aware of What Is Going on in a Student’s Mind? Understanding Wrong Answers about Plant Tropisms and Connection between Student’s Conceptions and Metacognition in Teacher and Learner Minds
AN  - 2309539250
AB  - Problems with understanding concepts and mechanisms connected to plant movements have been diagnosed among biology students. Alternative conceptions in understanding these phenomena are marginally studied. The diagnosis was based on a sample survey of university students and their lecturers, which was quantitatively and qualitatively exploratory in nature (via a questionnaire). The research was performed in two stages, before and after the lectures and laboratory on plant movements. We diagnosed eight alternative conceptions before the academic training started. After the classes, most were not been verified, and in addition, 12 new conceptions were diagnosed. Additionally, we report that teachers are not aware of students’ possible misunderstandings. They do not perceive students’ troubles with switching between levels of representations, nor their alternative conceptions. A case of “curse of knowledge” was observed and academic teacher training is recommended. Additionally, the need for metacognition as a crucial element in laboratory activities seems supported by our presented results. Such metacognition refers to students as well as teachers, which leads to the conclusion that teachers should be aware of students’ way of thinking and the development of knowledge in one’s own mind.

ABSTRACT
The research assessed secondary school students’ conceptions of acid-base strengths by using the conceptual change instruction accompanied with concept maps and analogies. These teaching strategies were employed to help them make unfamiliar events familiar. Within a quasi-experimental design, the sample of the study consisted of 73 secondary school students. Pre- and post-tests were used to collect data. The results showed that the experimental group that took the conceptual change-oriented instruction performed better than the control group. In light of the results, it can be concluded that employing such visuals and interactive materials as concept maps and analogies for achieving conceptual change is effective in generating better understanding of chemistry concepts.

T1  - A systematic review of concept mapping-based formative assessment processes in primary and secondary science education
AN  - 2155042169
AB  - In this paper, we present and discuss the results of a systematic review of concept mapping-based interventions in primary and secondary science education. We identified the following recommendations for science educators on how to successfully apply concept mapping as a method for formative assessment: firstly, concept mapping should be constructed in teaching, preferably on repeated occasions. Secondly, concept mapping should be carried out individually if personal understanding is to be elicited; however, collaborative concept mapping might foster discussions valuable for developing students' understanding and for activating them as instructional resources and owners of their own learning. Thirdly, low-directed mapping seems most suitable for formative assessment. Fourthly, technology-based or peer assessments are useful strategies likely to reduce the load of interpretation for the educator and are compatible with timely feedback. Finally, elaboration should be part of the feedback, activating students as the owners of their own learning.

T1  - Using a three‐dimensional thinking graph to support inquiry learning
AN  - 2296294045
AB  - The use of external representations has a potential to facilitate inquiry learning, especially in hypothesis generation and scientific reasoning, which are typical difficulties encountered by students. This study proposes and investigates the effects of a three‐dimensional thinking graph (3DTG) that allows learners to combine in a single image, problem information, subject knowledge (key concepts and their relationships), and the hypothesizing and reasoning process involved in exploring a problem, to support inquiry learning. Two classes of eleventh grade students (97 in total) were randomly assigned to use either the 3DTG (i.e., experimental condition) or concept map (i.e., control condition) to complete a group‐based inquiry task in an online environment. Data were collected from multiple data sources, including measures of group inquiry task performance, postknowledge scores, postquestionnaires of student perceptions of consensus building, and open‐ended survey. The analysis of group task performance revealed that participants in the experimental condition performed better in the inquiry task than their counterparts specifically in generating hypotheses and reasoning with data, but not in drawing conclusions. The findings show the 3DTG's benefits in facilitating exploring and justifying hypotheses, and also suggest that the 3DTG can share equal value with concept mapping in terms of drawing conclusions and consensus building. In addition, students using the 3DTG achieved higher scores in the postknowledge test, although no difference was found in their perceptions of consensus building. These findings were validated by students' responses to the survey. Implications of this study and future work are also discussed.

T1  - The Development of Problem-Based Learning and Concept Mapping Using a Block-Based Programming Model to Enhance the Programming Competency of Undergraduate Students in Computer Science
AN  - 2155131398
AB  - The purpose of this research is to develop 
            problem-based learning and concept mapping by using 
            a block-based programming model (PBL-CBp model)
            and to evaluate the appropriateness of the PBL-CBp
            model. The research will be divided into two parts. The
            first part will be about learning style development and
            will study the theories and ideas which relate to
            problem-based learning, the programming process and
            the concept mapping and block-based programming. It
            will synthesise the steps in the problem-based learning
            method, and the steps in the program process and
            design the learning steps by using problem-based
            concept mapping and block-based programming. The
            second part will consist of an evaluation of the
            appropriateness of the model. An appropriateness
            questionnaire for the PBL-CBp model will be created
            and the PBL-CBp model will be submitted to five
          experts for improvement.

AN  - 2154503500
AB  - The contribution of data analytics to scientific knowledge and better informed society is widely recognized but there are challenges in the traditional curriculum including the need to incorporate more meaningful computational and graphical tools and to train data analysts with agile problem solving skills. The opportunity of efficient instructional arrangement and student support method may help students with best possible information surroundings that they need. Cognitive visual support using various visual tools may help students with components that improve their communication with the lesson and enhance engagement in the action that would otherwise be outside their capacity. This research demonstrates cognitive visual support implementation in delivering data analytics topic on probability. This investigation utilizes meaningful reception learning method in the instructional arrangement to contribute learning support by perform worked-example data analytics knowledge construction and problem solutions using three useful elements: active, constructive and collaborative. The presentation may provide advisor with specific and entire references to expand an applicable task statement consistently in active data analytics learning.

T1  - Does motivation matter? – The relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and enthusiasm and students’ performance
AN  - 2136547206
AB  - Knowledge and motivation of a teacher are two unchallenged, essential characteristics for successful education. Whilst the relevance of teachers’ professional knowledge for successful students’ learning has been studied in a sophisticated manner for years, the meaning of teachers’ motivational orientations for students’ performance still lacks a differentiated consideration. This construct is conceptualized by three domains: (1) self-efficacy, (2) subject-specific enthusiasm, and (3) enthusiasm for teaching the subject. Motivational orientations overall have shown to be relevant predictors of students’ learning. However, there are several dimensions of motivation and their relative importance remains unclear. Our study goes beyond the available findings by considering in detail each of the three domains’ relations to students’ performance. Thus, we aim to further contribute to the clarification of the predictors of students’ performance in school teaching. For this purpose, we conducted a study with 48 biology teachers and their 1036 students. To assess the three domains of teachers’ motivational orientations, we applied paper and pencil tests. Concept maps and paper and pencil tests were used to measure students’ performance. By specifying multilevel structural equation models, we examined the relationship between the domains of teachers’ motivational orientations and the performance of the students. Our results reveal no relationship between teachers’ self-efficacy and students’ performance, but a significant positive relationship between the latter and teachers’ subject-specific enthusiasm. Moreover, our results show a positive trend in the relationship between enthusiasm for teaching the subject and students’ performance. The results provide a differentiated picture about the importance of motivational orientations for the characterisation of an effective teacher. We discuss our findings in terms of possible effect mechanisms and their relevance for further research on teacher motivation and the improvement of teacher education programmes.

T1  - A Concept Map of Behavioral Sleep Medicine: Defining the Scope of the Field and Strategic Priorities
AN  - 2110263068
AB  - Behavioral sleep medicine (BSM) is a growing specialty with activities in science, practice, and education. In 2010, the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine (SBSM) was formed as a professional society to oversee regulation and professional activities in BSM and Behavioral Sleep Medicine became the official journal of the SBSM. In June 2018, the Diplomate of Behavioral Sleep Medicine was launched as a new certification for BSM providers. The proliferation of BSM activities has led to a need to assess the current state and identity of BSM. One useful tool for accomplishing this task is through a concept map. A concept map is a schematic devide used to represent a set of ideas or concepts within a framework of propositions (Novak, 1990). They are useful metacognitive tools for organizing information into a hierarchical structure and elucidating the relationship between the concepts. The SBSM Board of Directors (BOD) commissioned a project to develop a concept map for behavioral sleep medicine.

T1  - The Parker Model: Applying a Qualitative Three-Step Approach to Optimally Utilize Input from Stakeholders When Introducing New Device Technologies in the Management of Chronic Rheumatic Diseases
AN  - 2166306952
AB  - Background and Objective Qualitative methods such as semi-structured interviews and focus-groups are used to evaluate the applicability and relevance of device technologies in clinical practice, but when used alone, often lack generalizability. This study aimed to assess the face validity and feasibility of using a composite, three-step qualitative method (the Parker Model), to inform the development and implementation of ava®, an electromechanical device (e-Device) for subcutaneous selfadministration of the biologic, certolizumab pegol (CZP), used to treat rheumatic diseases. Methods The Parker Model combines concept mapping (CM), participatory design (PD), and stakeholder evaluation (SE). CM, a structured group process, was used to identify patients' opinions and concerns regarding the e-Device. Patients used this information in iterative PD sessions to create personal e-Device prototypes in cooperation with a designer and a healthcare professional. SE was performed based on semi-structured group and individual interviews with patients and disease-management stakeholders. Results The study recruited 14 patients, two doctors, two nurses, one medical secretary, and four other public servants. Three CM workshops revealed four key considerations: technical usability, physical design, concerns, and enthusiasm. Four personalized prototypes were developed during PD sessions. SE confirmed that the identified considerations were pivotal for the implementation and adaptation of the e-Device. Conclusions This study is the first to apply a composite, qualitative research model when introducing an e-Device for the treatment and management of rheumatic disease. Results show that input from patients and other stakeholders using the Parker Model can add value to the development and implementation of an e-Device.

T1  - Facilitators and barriers to smoking cessation among minority men using the behavioral-ecological model and Behavior Change Wheel: A concept mapping study
AN  - 2124868799
AB  - Background and aim 
Universal smoking cessation strategies are not always successful for minorities, among whom smoking is highly prevalent despite high intention to quit. This study identifies facilitators for smoking cessation, as perceived by minority male smokers, that can inform a culturally appropriate national plan for smoking prevention and cessation.
 Methods 
We conducted in 2013 a three-stage study among Arab minority male current and former smokers (ages 18–64) in Israel, among whom smoking is very high: first, a Concept Mapping (CM) study with 102 and 202 participants in the brainstorming, and sorting and rating phases respectively. Second, we assigned clusters identified in the CM study to contingency levels using the Behavioral Ecological Model (BEM). Third, we classified clusters into intervention functions and policies using the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW).
 Findings 
The CM study revealed 58 barriers and facilitators for smoking prevention and cessation that were sorted into 11 clusters by the participants. These clusters were analogous to four BEM level contingency of smoking (social, institutional, community and individual). We classified it into two main policy categories, based on the BCW: 1- restructuring the socio-political environment of smoking through affirmative government's policies towards Arab minority in Israel, and 2-developing a culturally appropriate plan for smoking cessation in Arab local authorities including: raising awareness about tobacco hazards; enforcing anti-smoking laws; strengthening community institutional action; providing smoking cessation services; considering raising prices for tobacco products, addressing psychological sources of smoking in Arab men.
 Conclusions 
Our study revealed barriers, facilitators and contingencies of smoking prevention and cessation with two main policy action items among the Arab minority in Israel: changing the socio-political environment of smoking, and developing a culturally appropriate smoking prevention and cessation national plan. Our study framework can inform policies and culturally appropriate interventions for smoking prevention and cessation in other minorities.

T1  - Recurring patterns in the development of high school biology students’ system thinking over time
AN  - 1993444809
AB  - The goal of this study was to identify and understand the mental models developed by 67 high school biology students as they learn about the human body as a complex system. Using concept maps, it sought to find an external way of representing how students organize their ideas about the human body system in their minds. We conducted a qualitative analysis of four concept maps created by each student throughout the 3-year learning process, which allowed us to identify that student’s systems thinking skills and the development of those skills over time. The improvement trajectories of the students were defined according to three central characteristics of complex systems: (a) hierarchy, (b) homeostasis and (c) dynamism. A comparative analysis of all of our students’ individual trajectories together revealed four typical learning patterns, each of which reflects a different form of development for systems thinking: “from the structure to the process level”, “from macro to micro level”, “from the cellular level to the organism level,” and “development in complexity of homeostasis mechanisms”. Despite their differences, each of these models developed over time from simpler structures, which evolved as they connected with more complex system aspects, and each indicates advancement in the student’s systems thinking.

T1  - Concept Raps versus Concept Maps: A Culturally Responsive Approach to STEM Vocabulary Development
AN  - 2312959319
AB  - [...]merging culturally informed tasks that incorporate writing skills represents a plausible pedagogical practice that can yield meaningful changes in student engagement and achievement in mathematics.

[...]we compare and contrast the structure of concept maps and the structure of rap songs to clarify the inherent connections between them to build a case for the consideration of lyrical concept maps as instructional tools within STEM education. 3.

According to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, low-income and minoritized youth lack foundational skills in STEM content [15].

According to Martin, “mathematics identity refers to the dispositions and deeply held beliefs that individuals develop, within their overall self-concept, about their ability to participate and perform effectively in mathematical contexts and to use mathematics to change the conditions of their lives” [42] (p. 206).

T1  - Traditional versus hypertextual index in an online course on Oscillation and Wave Physics
AN  - 2111764470
AB  - An online course on Oscillation and Wave Physics (https://ocw.upc.edu/webs/42254/Acustica_EN/) was implemented. As the first objective, this article describes its main features, especially the two types of indexes for accessing the different items (a traditional linear index, and a hypertextual index based on a concept map). The second objective is to describe the students’ response to the one index in comparison to the other. As a qualitative response (perception), obtained from the students’ free comments, some advantages of the hypertextual index were found, for example, the ability to raise curiosity about physics contents, or the building of a convenient attitude for learning autonomously. Some drawbacks perceived, which are put into perspective, were the possible equivocal interpretation of the guiding questions, or the uncertainty about following the optimal order of items. As a quantitative response (performance in exams), a small but significant difference was found only for two subtopics related to cross‐linked relationships between different conceptual aspects. This can be explained by a deeper internalization of these relationships through the concept map underlying the hypertextual index.

T1  - Priming students for whole-class interaction: using interdependence to support behavioral engagement
AN  - 2027993173
AB  - Student interaction at a whole-class level is tied to learning outcomes, but encouraging students to engage with their peers at a whole-class level is difficult. While little research has sought to promote student engagement with one another at this level, one factor that has been shown to increase student interaction in pairs and small groups is student–student interdependency. Yet, to date, no studies have attempted to examine the impact of prior interdependency at this smaller scale on students’ interactions as a whole-class. The current study tested this relationship in an undergraduate class learning science content (n = 19) through structuring interdependency (task and resource) during science learning. Students completed six science learning sessions each of which included a science learning activity followed by a whole-class concept mapping task. Students were audio and video recorded during the whole-class task, and then individual student behavior was coded in 10 s intervals during the first 10 min of each session. Generalized regression results showed that adding small group interdependency during learning predicted significantly more student science discussion (R2 = .05) and supportive interactions (R2 = .16), while predicting decreased expressions of science misunderstanding (R2 = .07) during the whole-class task. Additionally, the combination of task and resource interdependency predicted a further decrease in student expressions of misunderstanding (R2 = .07), but also increased student social distraction in comparison to task interdependency alone (R2 = .28). Together these findings suggest that prior interdependency can be leveraged to increase student behavioral engagement at the whole-class level.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the quality of science teachers’ argumentation as a result of their engagement in a teacher workshop on earthquake engineering emphasizing distributed learning approaches, which included concept mapping, collaborative game playing, and group lesson planning. The participants were ten high school science teachers from US high schools who elected to attend the workshop. To begin and end the teacher workshop, teachers in small groups engaged in concept mapping exercises with other teachers. Researchers audio-recorded individual teachers’ argumentative statements about the inclusion of earthquake engineering concepts in their concept maps, which were then analyzed to reveal the quality of teachers’ argumentation. Toulmin’s argumentation model formed the framework for designing a classification schema to analyze the quality of participants’ argumentative statements. While the analysis of differences in pre- and post-workshop concept mapping exercises revealed that the number of argumentative statements did not change significantly, the quality of participants’ argumentation did increase significantly. As these differences occurred concurrently with distributed learning approaches used throughout the workshop, these results provide evidence to support distributed learning approaches in professional development workshop activities to increase the quality of science teachers’ argumentation. Additionally, these results support the use of concept mapping as a cognitive scaffold to organize participants’ knowledge, facilitate the presentation of argumentation, and as a research tool for providing evidence of teachers’ argumentation skills.

T1  - Making sense of “STEM education” in K-12 contexts
AN  - 2092828962
AB  - BackgroundDespite increasing attention to STEM education worldwide, there is considerable uncertainty as to what constitutes STEM education and what it means in terms of curriculum and student outcomes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the commonalities and variations in educators’ conceptualizations of STEM education. Sensemaking theory framed our analysis of ideas that were being selected and retained in relation to professional learning experiences in three contexts: two traditional middle schools, a STEM-focused school, and state-wide STEM professional development. Concept maps and interview transcripts from 34 educators holding different roles were analyzed: STEM and non-STEM teachers, administrators, and STEM professional development providers.ResultsThree themes were included on over 70% of the 34 concept maps: interdisciplinary connections; the need for new, ambitious instructional practices in enacting a STEM approach; and the engagement of students in real-world problem solving. Conceptualizations of STEM education were related to educational contexts, which included the STEM education professional development activities in which educators engaged. We also identified differences across educators in different roles (e.g., non-STEM teacher, administrator). Two important attributes of STEM education addressed in the literature appeared infrequently across all contexts and role groups: students’ use of technology and the potential of STEM-focused education to provide access and opportunities for all students’ successful participation in STEM.ConclusionsGiven the variety of institutionalized practices and school contexts within which STEM education is enacted, we are not convinced that a single worldwide definition of STEM education is critical. What we do see as essential is that those working in the same system explore the common elements that are being attributed to STEM education and co-construct a vision that provides opportunities for all their students to attain STEM-related goals. This is especially important in the current reform contexts related to STEM education. We also see that common conceptions of STEM education appear across roles and contexts, and these could provide starting points for these discussions. Explicitly identifying the ideas educators are and are not selecting and retaining can inform professional learning activities at local and larger scales.

T1  - Knowledge organization through multiple representations in a computer-supported collaborative learning environment
AN  - 2055038295
AB  - Computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments provide learners with multiple representational tools for storing, sharing, and constructing knowledge. However, little is known about how learners organize knowledge through multiple representations about complex socioscientific issues. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate learners' knowledge organization (KO) through multiple representations in a CSCL environment. We designed a learning unit on nuclear energy and implemented it with a group of 20 college students. The participants used a web-based hypertext KO platform that incorporated three representational modes: textual, pictorial, and concept map. The platform interlinked learners' knowledge entries based on similar keywords. Utilizing mixed methods research we analyzed the individual entries and the knowledge base to determine KO both at the individual and the collective levels. We found that the density of the knowledge base was high; the learners mostly benefited from their text- and concept map-based entries, though the picture-based entries were also an important means for connecting entries with similar content and hence creating a dense knowledge base. Our results suggest that KO with multiple representations can create a more comprehensive knowledge base. Using distinct analytical approaches will allow CSCL researchers to better identify KO both at the individual and collective levels.

T1  - Multidisciplinary Smartphone-Based Interventions to Empower Patients With Acute Coronary Syndromes: Qualitative Study on Health Care Providers’ Perspectives
AN  - 2512698489
AB  - Background: Postdischarge interventions are limited in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to few scheduled visits to outpatient clinics and travel from remote areas. Smartphones have become a viable lifestyle technology to deliver educational and health interventions following discharge from hospital.
Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the requirements for the delivery of a mobile health intervention for the postdischarge management of patients with ACS via a multidisciplinary focus group.
Methods: We conducted a focus group among health care professionals (n=10) from a large metropolitan hospital in May 2017. These participants from a multidisciplinary team contributed to a 1-hour discussion by responding to 8 questions relating to the applicability of smartphone-based educational and health interventions. Descriptive statistics of the focus group data were analyzed using SPSS. The qualitative data were analyzed according to relevant themes extracted from the focus group transcription, using a qualitative description software program (NVivo 11) and an ontology-based concept mapping approach.
Results: The mean age of the participants was 47 (SD 8) years: 3 cardiologists; 2 nurse practitioners; 2 clinical nurses; 2 research scientists; and 1 physiotherapist. Of these participants, 70% (7/10) had experience using electronic health intervention during their professional practice. A total of 7 major themes and their subthemes emerged from the qualitative analysis. Health care providers indicated that comprehensive education on diet, particularly providing daily meal plans, is critical for patients with ACS. In terms of ACS symptoms, a strong recommendation was to focus on educating patients instead of daily monitoring of chest pain and shortness of breathing due to subjectivity and insufficient information for clinicians. Participants pointed that monitoring health measures such as blood pressure and body weight may result in increased awareness of patient physical health, yet may not be sufficient to support patients with ACS via the smartphone-based intervention. Therefore, monitoring pain and emotional status along with other health measures was recommended. Real-time support via FaceTime or video conferencing was indicated as motivational and supportive for patient engagement and self-monitoring. The general demographics of patients with ACS being older, having a low educational level, and a lack of computer skills were identified as potential barriers for engagement with the smartphone-based intervention.
Conclusions: A smartphone-based program that incorporates the identified educational materials and health interventions would motivate patients with ACS to engage in the multidisciplinary intervention and improve their health outcomes following discharge from hospital.

T1  - EFFECT OF TEACHING METHODS ON STUDENTS' ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN CHEMISTRY IN NIGERIA: META-ANALYTIC REVIEW
AN  - 2179201054
AB  - A lot of research studies have been conducted on effects of teaching methods on academic performance of students and they proved to be significant. But there is a discordant view on their results. This study uses metaanalytic review to harmonize studies conducted in Nigeria from 1990 to 2010 on effect of teaching method on students' academic performance in chemistry. This quasi experimental review was carried out under six phases namely; collection of the study, coding of the study, determination of inter-raters reliability, setting a benchmark for selecting a study, calculation of effect sizes and carrying out analysis. The required research studies must have statistics descriptions for computation of effect size. Fifty-one research works were sampled and used because they met the benchmark set for selection. Seven classes of teaching method were identified and they include: mastery learning (-0.013), Computer Assisted Instruction (0.146), Instructional Materials (0.208), Problem solving (0.315), Constructivist/concept mapping (-0.203), games/simulation/animations (0.173), student grouping/cooperative learning (0.218). The overall effect size is 0.147. The significant variations in the magnitude of effect sizes were resolved to some extent by application of random-model effect size meta-analytic technique. The major implication of this review is that we generated the most effective method of teaching chemistry.

T1  - Exploring Information Seeking Behavior of Farmers’ in Information Related to Climate Change Adaptation Through ICT (CHAI)
AN  - 2092569103
AB  - In Tanzania, agriculture sector is known for employing more than 70% of the total population. Agriculture sector faces many challenges including climate change. Climate change causes low productivity in agriculture; low productivity is caused due to poor implementation of agricultural policies and strategies. This poor implementation of policies has also caused many farmers to be not competent in climate change adaptation. Over the years, provisions of agricultural advice and extension were provided by various approaches, including training and visit extension, participatory approaches, and farmers' field schools. However, provision of agricultural advisory and extension service is inefficient. Also, in most cases the usage of most agricultural innovations and technologies developed is limited. A literature review indicates that the main reasons given by Tanzanian farmers for not using improved technology are not lack of knowledge or skill, but rather that the technologies do not contribute towards improvements (e.g., the technologies are not profitable or they imply to high risk). Thus, agricultural extension service needs to be geared towards teaching farmers how to develop innovative and cost effective technologies that are contextualized. Limited numbers of agricultural extension staff and less interactivity of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), such as radio and television, have been mentioned to be among the factors limiting the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services to the majority of farmers in Tanzania. The advancements in ICTs have brought new opportunities for enhancing access to agricultural advisory and extension service for climate change adaptation. In Tanzania, farmers and other actors access agricultural information from various sources such as agricultural extension workers and use of various databases from Internet Services Providers. Also there are different web - and mobile - based farmers' advisory information systems to support conventional agricultural extension service. These systems are producing bulk amounts of data which makes it difficult for different stakeholders to make an informed decision after data analysis. This calls for the need to develop a tool for data visualization in order to understand hidden patterns from massive data. In this study, a semi-automated text classification was developed to determine the frequently asked keywords from a web and mobile based farmers' advisory system called  UshauriKilimo after being in use for more than 2 years by more than 700 farmers.
Keywords: agro-advisory service, climate change adaptation, information, needs, seeking, behaviour
Background Information
Agriculture is the backbone of most African countries (Eicher, 2003; Havnevik Bryceson, Birgegård, Matondi, & Beyene, 2007; Salami, Kamara, & Brixiova, 2009; Lwoga, Ngulube, & Stilwell, 2011). In Tanzania, the sector is known for employing more than 70% of the total population, contributing about 25% to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), bringing about 66% of the foreign exchange, and providing raw materials for local industries (United Republic of Tanzania [URT], 2008, Haug & Hella, 2013). The sector also feeds the nation and is the source of livelihoods to most rural communities in the country. However, agriculture is identified as one of the sector's most vulnerable to climate change (Mwandosya, Nyenzi, & Lubanga, 1998). This has led to difficulty in maintaining food security in most of the countries including Tanzania (Isinika, Hella, & Moshi, 2016; Haug, 2016). Food security is not only affected by climate change but also other factors including: lack of agricultural support services, weak research-extension-farmer linkages, among others (URT, 2008; Isinika et al., 2016). These factors hinder agricultural policies and strategies, which have been implemented over the years. Consequently, poor implementation of agricultural policies has resulted in rural and farming communities in the country failing to adapt to the impact of climate change. Ospina and Heeks (2010) argue that adaptation is the act of household, communities, regions, or nation to either tolerate, withstand, resist, or absorb the impact brought on by climate change. Examples of impacts that can be brought by the effect of climate change are food security, livelihoods, human settlement, and water supply (Ospina & Heeks, 2010).
Climate change is a threat to human societies and natural ecosystems, yet public opinion research finds that public awareness and concern vary greatly (Lee, Markowitz, Howe, Ko, & Leiserowitz, 2015; Haug, 2016). Shackleton, Ziervogel, Sallu, Gill, and Tschakert (2015) report that to enhance understanding of the process of climate change adaptation and to facilitate the planning and implementation of socially-just adaptation strategies, deeper consideration of the factors that impede adaptation is required. In response, scholars have done much research to identify barriers to adaptation of climate change (Upadhyay & Bijalwan, 2015). However, despite this progress, knowledge of barriers that hamper adaptation in developing countries remains limited, especially in relation to underlying causes of vulnerability and low adaptive capacity (Mutabazi, George, Dos Santos, & Felister, 2014; Mutabazi, Amjath-Babu, & Sieber, 2015). Adaptation goes hand-in-hand with awareness among farmers. One of the approaches used as an awareness technique to deliver climate change adaptation information is the conventional extension service (Tumbo et al., 2015).
The advancements in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have brought a new opportunity for enhancing access to agricultural advisory and extension services (Upadhyay & Bijalwan, 2015). Empirical evidence from other developing countries like India, South Africa, and Ghana has shown that ICT have enhanced access to and usage of agricultural advisory and extension service (Aker, 2011; George et al., 2011). However, ICTs differ in terms of interactivity; thus, ICT can be categorized into traditional (less interactive) and modern (more interactive). The radio, television and the telephony are traditional ICTs most used in Tanzania (Mtega, 2012). Traditional ICTs are less interactive and in most cases they rarely enhance two-way traffic in the communication process, and when a feedback is made possible, it is not synchronous. Moreover, dissemination of agricultural information to farmers through traditional ICTs is always top-down in nature. Cole and Fernando (2012) describe top-down agricultural information dissemination result in an inadequate diagnosis of the difficulties being faced by farmers as the channel used does not facilitate a feedback mechanism. Thus, conventional ICTs are not effective for the provision of agricultural advisory and extension services in some rural areas of Tanzania. Modern ICTs used in Tanzania as mentioned by Sanga, Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, and Tumbo, (2016) includes Internet, mobile phone applications, and ICT enabled agro-advisory systems. Modern ICTs are more interactive ICTs as they allow more collaboration and provisions for instant feedback from crowd. Studies in Tanzania show that among the modern ICTs, mobile phones are the most used (Mtega & Malekani, 2009; Mtega, 2012; Sife, Kiondo, & Lyimo‐Macha, 2010; Sanga Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016).
According to the Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority (TCRA) second quarterly statistics report of 2016, mobile phone infrastructure and the subscriptions to mobile phone services has grown exponentially over the past 10 years (Tanzania Communication Regulatory Authority [TCRA], 2016; TCRA, 2017). This has created an opportunity to use mobile phone services among most of Tanzania from both urban and rural areas. Moreover, TCRA (2016) shows that both the on and off net tariffs have been falling from the year 2005 to 2016 thus making mobile phone services more affordable to the majority in the country. The report showed that subscriptions to mobile networks reached more than 41 million subscriptions registered at the end of June 2017. In this period, more than 3.7 billion text messages (SMS) were used to communicate (TCRA, 2017). This is the evidence why system that supports communication via SMS was opted in this study.
The reporti from workshop on  Improving Climate Services for Farmers in Africa and South Asia  identified challenges that hinder farmers from using climate services in different countriesii. The identified challenges from the report are as follows: traditional climate information is not well documented, there is a lack of accessibility to climate services, there exists ignorance or lack of knowledge on the availability of climate services, an absence of climate education is apparent, climate information not user friendly, there is lack of trust from farmers towards the service providers, at times the type of information is not reliable, there are inconsistencies in the information delivery, climate information is untimely communicated to farmers, channels of communications are not of the same quality depending on who is doing the communicating, when the communication occurs, and by what medium is used; language and technical understanding of the climate forecasts makes it problematic to interpret; there is a failure to analyze the benefits of climate information; there are poor linkages among actors along the value chains (e.g., between seed suppliers and farmers); there is a lack of sufficient capacity to make use of the information; climate information (especially the science-based) is mostly generalized and difficult to localize and access, and understanding of climate information (Tall et al., 2014).
Hence, there is no doubt that there is a need to enhance farmers access to advisory and extension service related to climate change adaptation using a blend of conventional methods, mobile phone applications, and other ICTs (Caine et al., 2015).
Significance of the Research Problem
Agricultural advisory and extension services in Tanzania are ineffective partly because most of the generated knowledge and information aimed to improve agricultural production do not reach farmers (Mkapa, 2005; URT, 2008). Also, farmers in Tanzania argue that the problem is due to lack of capital and labour. Furthermore, farmers cannot afford to take the risk and that farming is not necessarily profitable) (Haug, Hella, Nchimbi-Msolla, Mwaseba, & Synnevag, 2016; Haug, 2016). In most cases usage of developed agricultural innovations and technologies is limited due to limited number of agricultural extension staff with low access to agricultural information (United Republic of Tanzania [URT] 2011). Yet, there is fast growing ICT infrastructure in Tanzania in both rural and urban areas (TCRA, 2017). Several studies have shown that rural farmers in Tanzania have started using ICTs for accessing various services to support their farming (Sanga, Kalungwizi, & Msuya, 2013; Sanga, Mlozi, Tumbo, Mussa, Muhiche, & Haug., 2014; Churi, Mlozi, Mahoo, Tumbo, & Casmir, 2013; Mtega, 2012; Nyamba & Mlozi, 2012; Churi, Mlozi, Tumbo, & Casmir, 2012; Chilimo, 2008; Mtega & Malekani, 2009; Mushi & Nduye, 2012; Alhassan & Kwakwa, 2012). Despite of a number of researches in Tanzania, there are few studies that have been done related to research in developing tools for visualizing data in climate change adaptation (Sanga, Sumari, & Tumbo, 2013). Even though there is potential of ICT for agriculture in Tanzania, enabling farmers to access agriculture information on climate change adaptation has not been addressed well (Mushi & Nduye, 2012; Isinika et al., 2016).
Limited access to timely and accurate information has been identified as a major hindrance to enable farmers to get agriculture information on climate change adaptation (Ajayi et al., 2008). The evidence of this fact is that farmers have no reliable way of knowing when to plant their crops due to change of rainfall patterns (Mwalukasa, 2013). As such, farmers plant before it rains, which leads to destruction of seeds in the soil. Under such circumstances, this deprivation on the farmers could be greatly reduced if they had prior information regarding weather conditions. The forecast of weather need to be done using sophisticated technology since the rain patterns have changed and that the small rainy season has more or less disappeared in some placed (Haug, 2016).
In the light of the above, the Government of Tanzania has taken a number of steps to come up with different ICTs tools, including radio and television, through which farmers could access agricultural knowledge and information (Lwoga, 2010; Mushi & Nduye, 2012). However, there are some drawbacks with regard to the effectiveness of these tools in disseminating and communing climate change adaptation information. First, the broadcast media, such as television and radio, are expensive and most farmers cannot afford to buy them. Second, timing of the information is another problem. To access the information, farmers have to be listening or watching at the same time the programme is broadcasting (Mntambo, 2007). Hence, farmers are adopting mobile phones to access agricultural information which are cost effective, accessible, and cheap (Sanga, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). Despite the fact that mobile phones-based applications are mostly used to enhance agricultural extension service but have brought a new challenge (Wyche & Steinfield, 2016). This challenge is caused by massive data which are generated (Keim, Kohlhammer, Ellis, & Mansmann, 2010). Thus, the massive data generated call for a need of developing a tool for data visualization. The aim is at helping farmers and other actors to make informed decision out of the user generated massive data. Content analysis using word or content cloud has been studied by many researchers (McNaught & Lam, 2010; Cidell, 2010) but its applicability in analysing massive (or big data) generated in ICT based agro-advisory service systems (with content in Swahili) is not adequately researched. This is the research gap which this study seeks to fill. Thus, the goal of this paper is to evaluate information seeking behaviour/patterns of farmers who used  UshauriKilimo for more than two years in consulting for advisories related to climate change adaptation.
This study tried to answer the following research questions:
1.  What are the information needs of farmers in Tanzania who are using UshauriKilimo in advisory information related to climate change adaptation?
2.  What are the information seeking behaviors of farmers in Tanzania who are using UshauriKilimo in advisory information related to climate change adaptation?
Research Methodology
Description of the Study Sites
The study was conducted in Kilosa District. Kilosa District has good ICTs infrastructure which enable access and use of mobile phones on various uses. Also, this District has been chosen due to high agricultural produce and high arable land for cultivation. In addition, the District is experiencing effect of climate change (Paavola, 2008; Mutabazi et al., 2014; Mutabazi et al., 2015).
Research Design
The research adopted the qualitative research method. Specifically, content analysis was used to analyse the qualitative data which is found on  UshauriKilimo server.
Case Study of UshauriKilimo
UshauriKilimo was developed through participatory action research method (Sanga, Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). It allows farmers and other actors to use their mobile phones to access agricultural information from researchers and extension workers (Sanga, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). The agricultural information consists of different categories of information needed by farmers, including information related to adaptation of climate change. The stakeholders/actors who are using UshauriKilimo have been given capacity building for more than two years. The capacity building and empowerment activities were done through training and workshops. Also, there were visits by farmers from Dodoma Municipal in Dodoma and Kilolo District in Iringa to Kilosa farmers in Morogoro. Currently, there are more than 700 farmers who are using UshauriKilimo. The farmers who are using UshauriKilimo are producing massive data (i.e., big data) relating to different topics in agriculture including climate change.
Figure 1. Data analysis process.
UshauriKilimo is a crowdsourcing platform which allows farmers and other actors (i.e., crowd) to engage in all phases of research process (Sanga, Phillipo, Mlozi, Haug, & Tumbo, 2016). This act of engaging farmers and other actors in scientific investigation is called citizen science. Citizen science refers to the engagement of farmers and other actors (i.e., non-professional volunteers) in scientific investigations (i.e., by asking questions for needs, requirements assessment, or collecting data; developing software, evaluation of software, using the software, or interpreting results (Newman et al., 2012).
Data Analysis
After massive data had been deposited in a crowdsourcing platform, the data mining tool was developed to help farmers search information using different keywords. The tool fetched data from the UshauriKilimo knowledge server (Figure 1). The results from the search were further subjected to data cleaning. The cleaned data were extracted to the data mining tool. The aim of this process was for recognizing a pattern of most frequent words (i.e., word visualization) from the corpus of a crowdsourcing platform.
In order to harvest data for this study, data from UshauriKilimo with keywords, such as climate or weather, were searched. Since the data in UshauriKilimo was in Swahili, the keyword that was used during searching was "hali ya hewa" (Table 1). After that had been collected, the data were analysed using a mixed methods approach (i.e., manual content analysis method and automated text classification, such as semi-automatic text classification).

Results and Discussion
A simple search in a crowdsourcing platform using the keyword "hali ya hewa" (Swahili word for weather and climate), 22 questions and answers were obtained (Figure 2).
Figure 2. Search interface for the system.
Then all 22 statements containing questions and answers were cleaned to remove mobile phone numbers of farmers who asked questions and the dates when the questions were asked. After this data cleaning process, 1148 words were extracted (Figure 3).
Figure 3. Data cleaning of the results from simple search.
The 1148 words obtained were entered or superimposed in a web-based word or text visualization system or word cloud (www.wordle.net).
Limitations of Study
This study has some limitations which need to be noted. According to Zhu, Rodríguez-Hidalgo, Questier, and Torres-Alfonso (2015) the study which deals with analysis of texts has limitations in terms of the following factors, namely: sample size, contextualized environment of the study, and Hawthorne effect. With respect to these factors, the study sample size was small and limited to 22 farmers who asked advisories related to "climate change." Secondly, the result of this study is applied to a specific setting and thus, cannot be generalized. Lastly, the results might be related to the so-called Hawthorne effect as the respondents who are either farmers, extension agents, and researchers were introduced to new method of agro-advisory system using ICT. This system was used to complement a conventional agricultural extension system and was not used on its own.
Figure 4. Word cloud after analysis using Wordle.
Words which appear most in the 22 frequently asked questions were: climate, weather, agriculture, soil, water, teak, forestry, rain, drip irrigation, hot temperature, crops, passion, and advisory (Figure 4). The words like "mazao ya ukame" (drought tolerant varieties) means farmers are aware of elements of climate smart agriculture ("kilimo hifadhi") which include use of drought resistant varieties and crops. Also, the word "drip," which mean use of drip irrigation, is highly recommended for climate smart agriculture. As well, the other frequently used words like "mitiki," which means teak trees, are recommended to conserve soil ("udongo") and water ("maji") so as to sustain smallholder farmers livelihoods (Lacombe, Bolliger, Harrison, & Ha., 2016) were found in word cloud.
With the Wordle analysis, it is not easy to determine the frequency of appearance for each word asked by farmers. Thus, we opted to subject analyse the same texts using a different tool for analysis called "TagCrowd." The results after the analysis using TagCrowd is as depicted in Figure 5.
Figure 5. Word cloud after analysis using TagCrowd.
After triangulation of analysis using two word visualization tools, researchers concluded that the most frequent keywords obtained from TagCrowd almost resemble those which were obtained using the Wordle analysis tool (Figure 4, Figure 5). The keywords obtained from TagCrowd tool are: climate, weather, agriculture, soil, water, teak, forestry, rain, drip irrigation, hot temperature, crops, passion, and advisory. These keywords point to the impact of climate change. This is supported by previous literature from a study area which showed that there is impact experienced by farmers due to climate change. Mayala et al. (2015) argue that farmers in Kilosa indicated that there is change of rainfall pattern and resulted to insufficient food and rise in temperature (Isinika et al., 2016). Even though Kilosa District is experiencing the effects of climate change, a study by Mayala et al. (2015) found that farmers in Kilosa have little knowledge on climate change because one in four understand the word "mabadiliko ya tabia nchi," a Swahili word for climate change.
When we searched UshauriKilimo using keyword "mabadiliko ya tabia," we found 4 results. Three farmers asked about the type of crops which they can grow well under limited rainfall. The fourth farmer asked about "why wild animals from Mikumi National Park invade their crops? Is it because of climate change?"
Results from this study show that even though mobile and web-based agro-advisory service systems, after being in use for two years, produced bulk data, evaluating the pattern of data (in terms of words and texts) from its database is a difficult process (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5). Different researchers have used various qualitative and quantitative data analysis techniques, such as concept mapping, social networks analysis, and content analysis using word visualization tools (Zhu et al., 2015; Cho & Tobias, 2009; Berlanga, Van Rosmalen, Boshuizen, & Sloep, 2012). In our case study, we developed a decision support system (DSS) for data visualization. Also, data visualization was done using Wordle and TagCrowd tools. Furthermore, Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to do additional analysis. This was done by compiling SPSS template with the data related to climate/weather, drought, and irrigation keywords in the questions asked by farmers using their mobile phones. The key words "Hali ya hewa," "ukame," and "umwagiliaji" were used to capture questions on climate change asked by farmers. There were 38 questions and answers related to these three keywords. Table 2 shows the date when the questions were asked, frequency, percentage, and the cumulative frequency (Table 2).

T1  - Teaching decision-making for sustainable infrastructure: a wind energy case study module
AN  - 2088867286
AB  - PurposeThis paper aims to introduce a case-based module teaching sustainable engineering, linking the Envision rating system with behavioral decision science. Three complete modules are publicly available in a repository for any instructor to adapt, use and review.Design/methodology/approachA case study was written about the Tucannon River Wind Farm, a project-certified Gold by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure’s Envision™ rating system. The case was used as the basis for an in-class PowerPoint module to achieve student learning outcomes related to sustainability.FindingsBefore and after surveys showed significant (p < 0.05) learning increases. Word clouds show changes in student perceptions of sustainable design. Rubric scoring of writing assignments and concept maps yielded valuable insights and improvements and demonstrated the overall validity of the module approach.Research limitations/implicationsModules lasting only one or two class days must be well-integrated into courses and curricula to promote greater learning value. Concept mapping may be a useful addition but involves a learning curve for both instructors and students.Practical implicationsBy offering instructors access to a set of case-based modules, it becomes more practical for them to teach about sustainable infrastructure and decision-making.Social implicationsThe module exemplifies a project owner and an engineering firm strongly committed to social and environmental sustainability. Envision’s Quality of Life and Leadership categories emphasize community well-being, involvement and collaboration.Originality/valueThis module offers a unique transdisciplinary focus meeting several needs in engineering education on sustainability, complex problems and decision-making.

T1  - Creation and implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity to stimulate interest in biochemistry among medical students
AN  - 2087441414
AB  - Learner‐centered pedagogical methods that are based on clinical application of basic science concepts through active learning and problem solving are shown to be effective for improving knowledge retention. As the clinical relevance of biochemistry is not always apparent to health‐profession students, effective teaching of medical biochemistry should highlight the implications of biochemical concepts in pathology, minimize memorization, and make the concepts memorable for long‐term retention. Here, we report the creation and successful implementation of a flipped jigsaw activity that was developed to stimulate interest in learning biochemistry among medical students. The activity combined the elements of a flipped classroom for learning concepts followed by a jigsaw activity to retrieve these concepts by solving clinical cases, answering case‐based questions, and creating concept maps. The students' reception of the activity was very positive. They commented that the activity provided them an opportunity to review and synthesize information, helped to gage their learning by applying this information and work with peers. Students' improved performance especially for answering the comprehension‐based questions correctly in the postquiz as well as the depth of information included in the postquiz concept maps suggested that the activity helped them to understand how different clinical scenarios develop owing to deviations in basic biochemical pathways. Although this activity was created for medical students, the format of this activity can also be useful for other health‐professional students as well as undergraduate and graduate students. © 2018 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 46:343–353, 2018.

T1  - UTILIZATION OF 5Es' CONSTRUCTIVIST APPROACH FOR ENHANCING THE TEACHING OF DIFFICULT CONCEPTS IN BIOLOGY
AN  - 2057535428
AB  - Studies show that students perform poorly at the secondary school level in biology. The concepts considered as difficult contribute more to the poor performance. The fact remains that the topics related to these concepts are found to be difficult by the teachers teaching them. The undesirable trend has been attributed among other reasons to ineffective pedagogy among teachers of biology. This problem led to an upsurge of research into innovative approaches that can alleviate the situation. One such emerging approach advocated here is the use of 5Es' constructivist approach. The approach advocates problem solving learning atmosphere where learners are effectively guided to take responsibility for their learning, the effective utilization of which can enhance biology teaching and learning. This paper focused on how this approach could be applied in teaching one of the identified difficult concepts in biology namely; respiration. Some empirical studies on the effectiveness of the constructivist-based methods when compared with other approaches were reviewed. A sample of note of lesson using the 5Es' approach and guide was designed. It was recommended among others that government as well as professional associations should organize training for biology teachers on the use of 5Es' learning cycle as effective teaching approach.

T1  - User conceptualizations of derivative relationships in the bibliographic universe
TT  - The bibliographic universe
AN  - 2034287766
AB  - PurposeConsiderable effort is devoted to developing new models for organizing bibliographic metadata. However, such models have been repeatedly criticized for their lack of proper user testing. The purpose of this paper is to present a study on how non-experts in bibliographic systems map the bibliographic universe and, in particular, how they conceptualize relationships between independent but strongly related entities.Design/methodology/approachThe study is based on an open concept-mapping task performed to externalize the conceptualizations of 98 novice students. The conceptualizations of the resulting concept maps are identified and analyzed statistically.FindingsThe study shows that the participants’ conceptualizations have great variety, differing in detail and granularity. These conceptualizations can be categorized into two main groups according to derivative relationships: those that apply a single-entity model directly relating document entities and those (the majority) that apply a multi-entity model relating documents through a high-level collocating node. These high-level nodes seem to be most adequately interpreted either as superwork devices collocating documents belonging to the same bibliographic family or as devices collocating documents belonging to a shared fictional world.Originality/valueThe findings can guide the work to develop bibliographic standards. Based on the diversity of the conceptualizations, the findings also emphasize the need for more user testing of both conceptual models and the bibliographic end-user systems implementing those models.

T1  - Exploring Mind Maps for Assessment in an Introductory Chemical Engineering Course
AN  - 2315587222
AB  - Mind maps are a study tool for students to visualize and organization in a way that emphasizes the way that concepts are connected to one another. Their use has been documented in several technical fields, including medicine, industrial engineering, and environmental engineering. Many publications on the use of mind maps or concept maps include one or more ideas on how to assess the quality of these diagrams.
In this work in progress, we summarize several different ways that have already been proposed and implemented in the literature to evaluate mind maps. Some rubrics view a concept map holistically, while others attempt to deconstruct maps into component pieces, like number of topics or number of connections, for scoring. We describe our experiences using some of these approaches in evaluating our own use of mind maps in the classroom.
We have collected two years’ worth of mind maps from our university’s Introduction to Chemical Engineering course as part of an end-of-semester exercise that is presented to students as a final exam preparation activity. We seek to address two questions using this activity: (1) Is there any relationship between the quality of mind maps and student performance in the course, and (2) Is there any significant change between the 2016 and 2017 student responses that may have resulted from changes made to the course between these years? Indirectly, we seek to determine whether mind maps would be a useful measure for direct assessment to track continuous improvement initiatives related to this course. We also seek to determine whether one established strategy for assessing mind maps is more amenable to addressing these questions than others.

T1  - Methods to Study Elements of the Instructional Scaffolding Strategy Model for Enhancing Engineering Students' Knowledge Construction in an Online Social Collaborative Learning Environment
AN  - 2315583827
AB  - Engineering students face low levels of knowledge construction when developing competence and expertise in the engineering field [Streveler et al., 2008]. In addition, the industry is left dissatisfied by engineering students’ deficiency in potential skills and low levels of academic achievement [Felder, 2012]. In order to assist engineering students to perform well in achievement tests, it is necessary to design instructional scaffolding during the learning process. Scaffolding students’ learning via an online learning medium is quite a challenging task. There is thus the considerable need for strategies to enable instructors to assist students’ learning through such a medium. The instructional scaffolding strategy model can provide a foundation in identifying a mechanism that will lead to the description of successful metacognitive scaffolding approaches that can be used by instructors to help students in learning via an online medium.
This research paper describes and explains methods used in determining the instructional scaffolding strategy elements of a model to enhance engineering students’ knowledge construction in an online social collaborative learning environment. The design of the instructional scaffolding strategy model is examined using qualitative methodologies. The process of enhancing students’ knowledge construction is examined qualitatively using interviews, content analysis, and thematic analysis. The categorization and analysis are achieved using concept mapping.
Ten participants took part in structured interview sessions to investigate instructional scaffolding elements. These comprised five interviewees who had significantly improved their scores on an achievement test, and another five who had actively participated in a metacognitive learning activity via the Facebook discussions in the online social collaborative learning environment and had also performed well in their tests. The following are the key findings from the study: (a) Instructional Scaffolding has eight elements in total: 1 - pre-engagement; 2 - shared goal; 3 -understanding of students’ prior knowledge; 4 - provide a variety of support; 5 - provide encouragement and praise; 6 - give feedback; 7 - provide supportive and positive responses; and 8 - provide instructional support. (b) Elements to provide a variety of support and give feedback can interconnect, as in the “explanation and guide” theme from the axial coding. These themes are mapped out to design an instructional scaffolding strategy model.
More effective pedagogical practices to improve engineering students’ knowledge construction in online learning have been the subject of much argument from researchers and deserve further investigation. It is important to understand the design process of an instructional scaffolding strategy. Designing instructional scaffolding strategies as a platform for metacognitive scaffolding approaches can help instructors to improve engineering graduates’ knowledge construction in terms of higher order thinking.

T1  - Using Concept Maps to Assess Student Learning in a Multi-Section Introduction to Engineering Course

AB  - Using Concept Maps to Assess Student Learning in a Multi-Section Introduction to Engineering Course
This Evidence-based Practice paper will describe the use of a simple concept map assignment to create a foundation for productive faculty conversations across multiple engineering disciplines regarding student learning and pedagogical approaches in a required introduction to engineering course. The authors are part of a team of professors who teach sections of an introduction to engineering course that is required of all first-year engineering students at their institution. While the course has common student learning outcomes that apply to multiple areas of engineering (e.g., that students will understand the engineering design process), each section of the course may take different pedagogical approaches to achieving those outcomes. In addition, each professor selects his/her own topic and adds specific student learning outcomes to the common outcomes that are related to his/her area of disciplinary expertise. The sections of the course that serve as the foundation for the work presented in this paper are taught by faculty members in chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and computer engineering, and mechanical engineering.
Motivation and Background: The authors are motivated by a desire to understand how the different approaches faculty use in this introductory course impact student learning. In a pilot project in fall 2015, the authors used a simple concept map assignment, given on the first and last day of each section, to evaluate student learning in the course. This pilot project compared student learning in two sections of the course taught by faculty in the same engineering discipline. The authors found the exercise to be a useful way to understand student learning in relation to the student learning outcomes for each of their sections as well as variations in student learning across the two course sections. The latter proved to be a useful foundation for in-depth discussions regarding the different pedagogical approaches used by the authors. The work led to the development of multiple recommendations for improvements in both course sections.
In fall 2017, the authors invited faculty from other engineering disciplines who were teaching sections of the introductory course to use the concept map assignment so that the results could be used to compare student learning across sections of the course offered by faculty members in different engineering disciplines, and to facilitate discussions of the different approaches taken in teaching the course as well as identification and sharing of best practices. This paper describes the process and outcomes of the larger project, with a focus on how such an approach can be used more broadly in the analysis and development of introductory engineering courses.
Methods and Anticipated Results: Students were asked to develop a concept map in response to the prompt “What is engineering?” In the pilot project, students developed an initial map on the first day of class and were asked to develop a new map on the last day of class. The authors then used a common rubric to evaluate changes between these concept maps and created radar plots to display the results. For the current project, students were asked to develop an initial concept map on the first day of class; on the last day of lass they were asked to modify the map given the current state of their understanding of the term “engineering.” The authors identified specific words that students at the end of the course added to the concept maps they created at the start of course. Word clouds were then created to visualize the frequency of specific words added to the maps for each individual section of the course. The word clouds were shared among the faculty members teaching the course. The word clouds then were used to facilitate a productive discussion of differences between the sections of the courses in terms of intended and actual student outcomes, and the pedagogical approaches that correlated with desired student learning.

T1  - Refining Concept Maps as Method to Assess Learning Outcomes Among Engineering Students
AN  - 2315576351
AB  - Concept mapping (CM) activities are well understood as a formative, generative and summative means to assess learning and document knowledge acquisition in a variety of disciplines. Within Engineering Education (EE) and other STEM fields, CM has been deemed successful in assessing whether a given set of students have achieved learning goals associated with ‘perfect’ (or near perfect) representation of established engineering and scientific concepts. What is less understood is how to assess learning goals in which there is no ‘perfect’ answer or expert level example to the question. CMs have struggled in adapting to situations where students need to demonstrate the competencies in complex sociocultural phenomenon, systems thinking, or ethical reasoning. The challenges are clear for those educators, assessors and companies that want engineering students to have demonstrated the non-technical standards set forth by ABET EC2000, specifically C3 and C5, and the current debates among those in charge of accreditation. This paper offers a methodological application from past research and suggests refinements in the administration and scoring of concept maps after presenting the successes and challenges of this form of assessment. The goal is to understand knowledge acquisition related to conceptualizing the interconnections between technical, social, environmental, ethical and global dimensions of engineering. We build on a previously developed data set with an initial ‘pre-test’ concept mapping activity performed in August 2016 by 151 4th year undergraduate engineering students enrolled in a mandatory, multidisciplinary course sequence on the first day of class. A second CM ‘post-test’ was performed by 115 of the original students in early March 2017. Comparing the output of pre- and post-test demonstrates what categories of knowledge are acquired and how the acquired knowledge aligns with the ABET criteria. A second evaluation considers how instructor’s pedagogical approaches influence the outcomes. This analysis suggests that CM offers a compelling strategy to assess knowledge acquisition where no ‘perfect’ answer can be used for absolute measurement. This assessment method offers a bridge from assessment tools for individual knowledge representation and programmatic assessment.

T1  - Methods for Measuring Systems Thinking: Differences Between Student Self-assessment, Concept Map Scores, and Cortical Activation During Tasks About Sustainability
AN  - 2315573516
AB  - Systems thinking is a necessary skill towards solving complex civil engineering problems with interconnected environmental, social, and economic inputs and outputs. The dynamic relationship between systems components can act as a barrier for sustainability if decision makers work to reduce rather than understand complexities. To help advance methods for assessing and measuring students’ ability to think in systems, multiple methods were used and compared, including: a previously developed 15-item self-report survey named Systems Thinking Scale Revised (STSR), three scoring approaches to concept mapping and advanced cognitive neuro-imaging methods to measure physical changes in cognition. Engineering students (n=28) completed the STSR survey to report their capacity of systems thinking. They were outfitted to wear a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) system and asked to draw a concept map related to sustainability topics about energy, food, climate, and water. Their concept maps were scored using three approaches: the traditional, holistic, and categorical scoring method. The result shows that students’ self-evaluated systems thinking tendency is negatively (Spearman’s r = -0.50, p = 0.016) correlated with their concept map performance graded with the traditional scoring method, while positively (r = 0.39, p = 0.038) correlated to the sub-scores on the environment concepts using the categorical scoring method. Efficiency in brain connectivity, which is calculated using fNIRS data, is positively correlated with the complexity index using the categorical scoring approach (r = 0.45, p = 0.016) and the sub-scores of comprehensiveness in holistic scores (r = 0.42, p = 0.025). The results suggest students with higher performance of systems thinking were also more cognitively efficient. This study contributes to engineering education by demonstrating a new measurement tool to understand systems thinking and students’ cognitive abilities. The results also demonstrate possible discrepancies in previously developed surveys, concept map scoring techniques and cognition measured through changes in cortical activation. This trans-disciplinary approach bridges engineering education, sustainability, and neuroscience and begins to open new avenues of research helping measure the effectiveness of assessment techniques with physical responses of cognitive activation.

T1  - Teachers’ Transformed Subject Matter Knowledge Structures of the Doppler Effect
AN  - 2786517523
AB  - The pupils’ poor performance in science in South African secondary schools is well documented. Therefore, it is deemed necessary to conduct a study that would portray knowledge structures for teaching a science topic. This is an empirical qualitative interpretive multiple case study looking at four physical science teachers teaching Doppler Effect to Grade 12 pupils. The data was collected through classroom observations and teacher interviews. Data analysis was done using concept maps. The results show that teachers’ knowledge as portrayed during the teaching lack coherence and to some extent the correctness that is expected of teachers. The weaknesses are considered likely to compromise their pupils’ conceptual understanding of the topic.

T1  - An improved visual description of the VIM
AN  - 2572347393
AB  - All the sciences and several disciplines have their own vocabulary, and metrology is not the exception. The international vocabulary of metrology (VIM) includes an annex with concept diagrams which represent most of the relations among the concepts defined in the main text of the vocabulary. Even when these diagrams follow international standards, they are usually confusing and sometimes hard to understand. OSSAD (Office System Support Analysis and Design) is a visual language that has been used to document management systems and has its own structure, syntax and grammar. Visual representation through OSSAD of originally blurred textual procedures has proved its usefulness in translating text into visual diagrams easy to understand for inexperienced users. The adaptation of OSSAD to visually description of the VIM is showed in this paper. A comparative analysis between the current concept diagrams and the proposed ones was done. The visual language has allowed the mapping of complex relationships between VIM concepts in a more natural way, and the results of a questionnaire suggest that comprehension of metrology terminology in classroom has been improved with the OSSAD visual description of the VIM.

T1  - Using remap-TmPS learning to improve low-ability students' critical thinking skills
AN  - 2162700782
AB  - Some research findings showed that Indonesian students' critical thinking skills below average, especially those who have a low academic ability; even though that skills are needed to face this 21st century. There should be a strategy to train students to develop their critical thinking, one of them is by implementing an appropriate learning model. One of the alternatives is Reading-Concept Map-Timed Pair Share (Remap-TmPS) model. This study aimed to find out the effect of Remap-TmPS model and students' different academic ability towards their critical thinking skills on Biology. This research was conducted in Senior High Schools in Batu, East Java, Indonesia. Pretest-Posttest Nonequivalent Control Group Design was employed in this study and 116 students were involved as the participants. There were two experimental classes taught using Remap-TmPs and two control classes taught as well by using conventional learning. Data on students' critical thinking skills were collected using an essay test. The results of the test were assessed using the critical thinking skills' scoring rubric and an ANACOVA test. The research finding showed that students who have the low academic ability in Biology learning who taught by using Remap-TmPS have equal critical thinking skills or the same as students' who have high academic ability who taught by using conventional learning. So, learning Biology using Remap-TmPS can be used as an alternative for students' who have a low academic ability in order to enhance their critical thinking skills.

T1  - Cooperative integrated reading and composition (CIRC) with mind mapping strategy and its effects on chemistry achievement and motivation
AN  - 2162697062
AB  - The aim of this research was conducted to determine the effects of Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC) with mind mapping strategy on the student's achievement and motivation of 11th-grade Secondary students in Pekanbaru Indonesia regarding topics related to colloid. This research employed a pre test / pos test quasi-experimental design. This study was carried out with two groups, a study group (were instructed using CIRC with mind mapping method) while a control group (approached with conventional teaching method). Data for achievement were collected using Colloid Conceptual test and motivation data were collected using a questionnaire. The data were analyzed used SPSS 20.0 statistic program in term of descriptif, frequency, aritmathic means, and standar deviation. Unclear sentence inferential statistical analysis used t-tests and MANOVA to identify differences in achievement and motivation of the treatment and control groups. The findings show that there are differences in the achievement of students who used Cooperative Integrated Reading and Composition (CIRC) with mind mapping strategy, and no significant difference in motivation. This research has identified a learning strategy that can improve students' achievement in chemistry that needs to be applied, so that they can enhance their learning experience and achievement in chemistry lesson.

T1  - Recommendations for obesity prevention among adolescents from disadvantaged backgrounds: a concept mapping study among scientific and professional experts
AN  - 2047422981
AB  - The present study aimed to enrich the scientific evidence on obesity prevention programmes for adolescents from socio‐economically disadvantaged backgrounds with practice‐based experiences from both scientific and professional experts in the field of youth obesity prevention. We used the participatory method of concept mapping. Two concept mapping sessions were conducted: one with programme coordinators of national/regional obesity prevention programmes across Europe (n = 8) and one with scientists participating in European obesity prevention projects (n = 5). Five recommendations were extracted from both concept maps: (1) involve adolescents in the design and delivery of the programme, (2) invest in family/parental capacity building, (3) provide and support a healthy school food and physical activity environment, (4) regulate exposure to unhealthy messages/advertising and (5) facilitate safe and active travel. These recommendations can be used as a conceptual framework for programme development for preventing obesity in adolescents.

T1  - Studying and Constructing Concept Maps: a Meta-Analysis
AN  - 2037920133
AB  - A concept map is a node-link diagram in which each node represents a concept and each link identifies the relationship between the two concepts it connects. We investigated how using concept maps influences learning by synthesizing the results of 142 independent effect sizes (n = 11,814). A random-effects model meta-analysis revealed that learning with concept and knowledge maps produced a moderate, statistically significant effect (g = 0.58, p < 0.001). A moderator analysis revealed that creating concept maps (g = 0.72, p < 0.001) was associated with greater benefit relative to respective comparison conditions than studying concept maps (g = 0.43, p < 0.001). Additional moderator analyses indicated learning with concept maps was superior to other instructional comparison conditions, and was effective across science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) and non-STEM knowledge domains. Further moderator analyses, as well as implications for theory and practice, are provided.

T1  - An Online Survey of Public Knowledge, Attitudes, and Perceptions Toward Whales and Dolphins, and Their Conservation
AN  - 2307857085
AB  - In 2015, an online survey was conducted to investigate public attitudes and perceptions toward key cetacean (whale, dolphin, and porpoise) conservation and 'hot topic' issues such as legislative protection and whaling (n=858). The vast majority of the participants in this study indicated their permanent residence was the United States (n=577) or India (n=251). Perceptions of participants on the conservation priority of cetacean species did not match with the factual IUCN status, where most participants assumed that the larger and more charismatic whales (blue whale, 24.01%; humpback whale, 22.14%; and killer whale, 23.43%) were more endangered or more important to conserve than the small cetacean species such as the Vaquita or Hector's dolphin. Additionally, 39.74% of participants indicated the bottlenose dolphin was the most important to conserve. More members of the public highlighted non-existent (fake) species (e.g. pygmy short-fined whale, lump-headed dolphin, and majestic spotted dolphin) as being of conservation concern than certain species of actual genuine concern. The majority of participants considered dolphins and whales to be "under protected" or only "slightly protected" (29.95%; 41.96%, respectively) and expressed that marine mammal conservation laws and policies were "very important" or "important" (47.43%; and 37.88%, respectively). In addition, 86.83% of participants expressed opposition to the hunting of dolphins and whales (57.93% "strongly opposed" and 28.90% "opposed"); however, only 47.44% of participants were aware that several countries are still involved in whaling. A lack of awareness of the conservation status of whales and dolphins and continued whaling activities suggests that greater outreach to the public about the conservation status of whale and dolphin species is needed.

T1  - Using concept maps to describe undergraduate students’ mental model in microbiology course
AN  - 2572243076
AB  - The purpose of this research was to describe students’ mental model in a mental model based-microbiology course using concept map as assessment tool. Respondents were 5th semester of undergraduate students of Biology Education of Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia. The mental modelling instrument used was concept maps. Data were taken on Bacteria sub subject. A concept map rubric was subsequently developed with a maximum score of 4. Quantitative data was converted into a qualitative one to determine mental model level, namely: emergent = score 1, transitional = score 2, close to extended = score 3, and extended = score 4. The results showed that mental model level on bacteria sub subject before the implementation of mental model based-microbiology course was at the transitional level. After implementation of mental model based-microbiology course, mental model was at transitional level, close to extended, and extended. This indicated an increase in the level of students’ mental model after the implementation of mental model based-microbiology course using concept map as assessment tool.

T1  - Développement participatif d'un référentiel de compétences pour favoriser l'utilisation de la recherche en éducation : une analyse critique
AN  - 2076266364
AB  - Cet article décrit la demarche d'élaboration d'un referentiel de competences visant a favoriser l'utilisation des connaissances issues de la recherche en éducation (CIR). Cette démarche visait a identifier les compétences des intervenants scolaires afin de favoriser l'utilisation des connaissances issues de la recherche dans leur école. Une analyse critique de cette démarche en regard des écrits scientifiques portant sur de telles démarches est aussi présentée. Cette analyse permet de constater que la démarche menée présente plusieurs forces, mais aussi quelques limites. Les principales forces de cette démarche résident dans le fait qu'elle a permis de tenir compte du contexte organisationnel, d'aller au-dela du statuquo pour décrire ce qui est, mais aussi ce qui devrait etre, et cela dans un langage et un format faciles d'approche. Toutefois, l'analyse mene au constat que la démarche n'a pas permis le développement d'indicateurs permettant de juger du niveau de compétence des professionnels ciblés.Alternate abstract:This article presents the development process of a competency model that intends to foster research-based knowledge utilization. This co-development process is aimed at identifying the necessary competencies for school practitioners to use research-based knowledge in their practice. An analysis contextualizing the process within the scientific literature on competency modelling allows an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of this development process. Specifically, this analysis shows that the great strengths of the process are that it took into account the organizational context and that it described not only what is but also what should be. Also, the process led to the production of a user-friendly competency model. However, the analysis also showed that the process did not lead to the development of a performance criteria.

T1  - Clinician ratings of the Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathic Personality (CAPP) in a representative sample of Spanish prison inmates: New validity evidence
AN  - 2024481421
AB  - The Comprehensive Assessment of Psychopathic Personality (CAPP) is a concept map of psychopathic personality disorder (PPD). The CAPP- Institutional Rating Scale (IRS) is a tool designed to assess CAPP symptoms in institutional settings. The CAPP contains 33 personality traits organized in six domains: attachment, behavioural, cognitive, dominance, emotional and self. Until now, much of the CAPP research has been conducted out of clinical, forensic and correctional settings using self-ratings. In the current study, the psychometric properties and construct validity of the CAPP-IRS were evaluated in a non-convenience sample of 204 Spanish convicts. Clinician ratings were employed. Participants had been imprisoned for at least 6 months at Pereiro de Aguiar Penitentiary. This group of inmates was heterogeneous with respect to type of official charges, and representative as all convicts interned for at least 6 months in this prison were screened for participation. Classical test theory indexes of reliability, correlations between CAPP items and domains and external correlations and structural analyses demonstrated that CAPP assessment is a solid and robust way of evaluating psychopathy in a correctional setting. Best fit was found for a three-factor model: attachment and emotional items associated with a callous and unemotional trait, dominance and self items associated with a pathological interpersonal style, and behavioural and residual items from other domains associated with impulsivity.

T1  - Preservice Science Teachers’ Instructional Design Competence: Characteristics and Correlations
AN  - 2786530942
AB  - Underpinned by a holistic, dynamic, and process-oriented view of teacher competences, this study provides an analytic hierarchy system of instructional design competence (IDC) for evaluating teachers’ IDC based on the mental model of instructional design. Additionally, this study quantitatively explores the IDC characteristics and correlations of 118 preservice science teachers at Shanxi Normal University in China, who learned the ADTRE (analyzing, designing, teaching, revising, and evaluating/improving) instructional model, based on reflection and feedback. Using lesson planning (LP) scoring rubrics, we analyzed 113 lesson plans from 56 participants majoring in biological science and 57 in biological technology. We present the ADTRE model and discuss relationships between preservice science teachers’ academic achievement and IDC. Major findings include a positive correlation between preservice science teachers’ IDC scores and their course grades in Advanced Mathematics and Cell Biology and concept mapping skills. There was a negative correlation between preservice science teachers’ IDC and course grades in Principles of Genetic Engineering and Technology, and no significant correlations existed between IDC and course grades for teacher education courses. Our findings reveal the nature of preservice science teachers’ IDC, a potential for improvement in university teacher education curricula, and a need for further research.

T1  - The effectiveness of Concept Mapping Content Representation Lesson Study (ComCoReLS) model to improve skills of Creating Physics Lesson Plan (CPLP) for pre-service physics teacher
AN  - 2572145586
AB  - This research is aimed to analyse the effectiveness of ComCoReLS (Concept Mapping Content Representation Lesson Study) model towards the improvement skills of Creating Physics Lesson Plan (CPLP) for pre-service physics teacher. This research used one group pre-test and post-test design on 12 pre-service physics teacher at University of Malang State (Indonesia) in academic year 2016/2017. Data collection was conducted through test and interview. Skills of creating physics lesson plan for pre-service physics teacher measurement were conducted through Physics Lesson Plan Evaluation Sheet (PLPES). The data analysis technique was done by using paired t-test and n-gain. The CoMCoReLS model consists of 5 phases, including (1) Preparation, (2) Coaching, (3) Guided Practice, (4) Independent Practice, and (5) Evaluation. In the first, second, third and fifth phases are done at University of Malang State, while the fourth phase (Independent Practice) is done in SMAN 1 Singosari, SMAN 2 Malang, SMA Lab UM, MAN 3 Malang. The results showed that there was a significant increase in skills of creating physics lesson plan for pre-service physics teacher at α = 5% and n-gain average of high category. Thus, the ComCoReLS model is effective for improving skills of creating physics lesson plan for pre-service physics teacher.

T1  - Exploring physics concepts among novice teachers through CMAP tools
AN  - 2572145041
AB  - Concept maps are graphical tools for organising, elaborating and representing knowledge. Through Cmap tools software, it can be explored the understanding and the hierarchical structuring of physics concepts among novice teachers. The software helps physics teachers indicated a physics context, focus questions, parking lots, cross-links, branching, hierarchy, and propositions. By using an exploratory quantitative study, a total 13-concept maps with different physics topics created by novice physics teachers were analysed. The main differences of scoring between lecturer and peer-teachers’ scoring were also illustrated. The study offered some implications, especially for physics educators to determine the hierarchical structure of the physics concepts, to construct a physics focus question, and to see how a concept in one domain of knowledge represented on the map is related to a concept in another domain shown on the map.

T1  - Evaluating the Effectiveness of Visual Narrative Illustrations Used to Teach Pathophysiology to Undergraduate Nursing Students
AN  - 2012379697
AB  - Nursing students and nurses often struggle with understanding pathophysiology concepts. Seventy-five students participated in two phases of an exploratory study that evaluated knowledge of pathophysiology concepts when taught using an innovation known as "visual narrative illustrations" (VNIs). Students taught using VNIs performed significantly better on a knowledge posttest and commented that the VNI humor and visual images helped them learn complex concepts. Used in combination with other teaching strategies, VNIs enhanced knowledge and understanding of pathophysiology concepts.

T1  - The Process of Collaborative Concept Mapping in Kindergarten and the Effect on Critical Thinking Skills
AN  - 2137838135
AB  - To develop and nurture critical thinking, students must have opportunities to observe and practice critical thinking in the classroom. In this parallel mixed method classroom study, we investigate the role of collaborative concept mapping in the development of kindergarten learners' critical thinking skills of analysis and interpretation over a five week period. Learners had two large group experiences and three dyad experiences of collaborative concept mapping. Results showed significant increases in critical thinking skills in the five week period when learners engaged in collaborative concept mapping supported by mentorship, discussion, and real-life scenarios. We propose collaborative concept mapping as an instructional strategy to develop critical thinking skills in the kindergarten classroom. Implications for future research and practice are discussed.

T1  - A Sharing Mind Map-oriented Approach to Enhance Collaborative Mobile Learning With Digital Archiving Systems
AN  - 2047933488
AB  - With the advances in mobile network technology, the use of portable devices and mobile networks for learning is not limited by time and space. Such use, in combination with appropriate learning strategies, can achieve a better effect. Despite the effectiveness of mobile learning, students' learning direction, progress, and achievement may differ. Thus, the enhancement of learners' opinions on the usability and interactivity during mobile learning are challenging issues to overcome. This study developed a sharing mind map-oriented mobile learning system integrated with valuable information preserved in a digital archiving system. In addition to the functions of traditional mind maps, this system also enabled students to complete and record relevant information that they had found onto the mind map and further improve the integrity of their own knowledge. To investigate the effectiveness of this teaching approach, this study added digital archive data and used mind map sharing to help learners develop knowledge. By using the proposed approach, students were able to perform self-assessment on learning content, choose appropriate learning directions, and progress according to their level of learning. At the same time, they could collaboratively learn with peers to engage themselves more deeply in their learning. That is, their learning motivation could be constantly triggered through the observations and sharing of mind maps from one to another. This study selected sixth graders as its research subjects in two classes at the school where one researcher works. There were 31 and 30 valid samples in the experimental group and control group, respectively, with a total of 61 students. The experimental group was conducted by using sharing mind map with corresponding geographical archived information to investigate the effectiveness of sharing mind map (SMM) in mobile learning; on the other hand, the control group was conducted by using a traditional learning approach. The outcomes indicate that students' learning performance could be enhanced by using archived information SMM mobile learning.Keywords: sharing mind map, collaborative mobile learning, digital archive, peer learningStudy BackgroundIn recent years, due to the process and enhancement of knowledge and science, e-learning management systems have increased rapidly. Many studies have pointed out that these techniques could optimize learning processes and effectiveness. Many scholars have utilized network technology for learning and statistical analysis, confirming the enhancement of the efficiency of learning by network technology. The development of mobile devices (e.g., smart phones, laptops, tablets, and so on) with wireless communication technology has changed the centuries-old rules for classroom instruction, resulting in breakthroughs in teaching methods (Biddix, Chung, & Park, 2016). Due to the portable properties of mobile devices, mobile learning helps students to cooperate with others to improve their self-learning. Through mobile devices and wireless networks, e-learning can be conducted in informal learning contexts, such as outdoor teaching (Huang & Chiu, 2015; Hwang, Wu, & Ke, 2011; Park, Nam, & Cha, 2012). Mobile learning can also make it possible to share knowledge quickly and help to enhance memorization.Recently, content-aware environments, such as augmented reality and GPS positioning information, have been integrated into the learning process (Huang & Chiu, 2015). However, because it is not location based, the learning effectiveness of mobile learning can only be assessed using various quantified reference values (e.g., number of hits, record of number of hours) of various learning behaviors. Students' actual perception of how effective their learning has been is usually ignored. In terms of the development of structured learning goals and objectives, it appears that students are not capable of planning learning progress by themselves. When students have to plan learning progress on their own or encounter learning obstacles, their progress tends to slow down and their learning effectiveness is affected. This situation can be resolved through the influence of peers, namely through collaborative learning (Chen & Chang, 2016; DeWitt, Alias, & Siraj, 2014). Eid and Al-Jabri (2016) investigated the relationship between sharing knowledge and independent learning in a college course. The results showed that the paired sharing mind model could benefit collaborative learning and learning activities, so as to enhance learning effectiveness. Sadeghi and Kardan (2016) suggested that computer supported technology can promote the potential of collaborative learning.One way to examine how shared learning takes place in situations where it is difficult to infer the internal state of an individual within a group is when those individuals use graphic expression methods to interact with a collaborative and virtual learning environment using mobile devices. This makes it possible for every participant's interactions to be followed automatically. Zheng, Huang, Hwang, and Yang (2015) examined the degree of collaborative learning in a group by comparing the prior knowledge of group members before entering the group, and the knowledge demonstrated by the group after collaborating together. An analysis of the interactions between group members, and of the knowledge acquired, was undertaken by studying the group's computer-assisted knowledge maps. The results showed that scientific and technological tools brought about positive benefits to the enhancement of knowledge via collaborative learning. Contemporary students live in an era when information is expanding rapidly all around them. To make sense of all this information, they generally need some special methods, such as mnemonics, flow charts, and so forth. One of these special methods is the mind map (MM), which was first introduced by Buzan and Buzan (1996). Although the concept of the MM was not given much attention when it was first introduced, it has proven to have many advantages over other traditional methods for assisting learning. For instance, MM can effectively present information, which one hears or sees in a rich visual form, and MM can allow learners to use both of their left and right brains simultaneously, which can make it easier for learners to present their ideas. Liu, Zhao, Ma, and Bo (2014) summarized and integrated learning improvement related articles to understand learning efficiency via MM. The results showed that MM could actually help improve learning. Moreover, numbers of studies showed that concept maps improved study quality in higher education. Radix and Abdool (2013) employed mind maps to facilitate creative learning tools. The actual collective creation with course mind maps in radiate structure could also effectively improve study quality.Motivation for the StudyThe

T1  - Let’s Talk About ‘My’ Concept Map: Use of Dialogue to Enhance Concept Mapping
AN  - 2386095147
AB  - The intersection of dialogue and concept map use is explored through this qualitative study. An introductory chemistry classroom for middle or high school students explores the combined effect of these two evidence-based teaching strategies. Following the lesson, students participated in a focus group to provide feedback on the lesson's use of discussing their concept maps. The results of that feedback and ideas for improvement and how to utilize this strategy in your own classroom is presented. Although this method may pose it's own unique set of challenges in the classroom, student understanding of basic foundational chemistry concepts was advanced.

T1  - An Exploration of School Staff Support for Children and Young People Experiencing Psychological Loss in One Secondary Pupil Referral Unit.
AN  - 2344262863
AB  - Experiences of psychological loss are both hugely significant and inevitable life events. Support of psychological loss for children and young people (CYP) in schools is therefore relevant to the role of educational psychologists (EPs). The two phases of the current research explored psychological loss support for CYP from the perspective of the school staff who deliver it. Conceptual mapping techniques and semi-structured interviews with 18 participants, working across 3 school settings, helped to map support of psychological loss in the first phase of the current research. Using thematic analysis an overall system of support for CYP experiencing psychological loss was identified, with adjustments to the support system suggested to be required according to the age and development of CYP. Relationships between school staff and CYP were highlighted as pivotal to the success of support for psychological loss within this system, suggesting that EP support for psychological loss may be best placed in offering support to those who are supporting CYP in schools. In order to explore an approach to supporting school staff with psychological loss, a case study of an EP training programme with 9 participants from a secondary PRU school setting was outlined in the second phase of the research. It was found that adopting an approach that was specific and relevant to the setting, with a focus on the language associated with loss and celebration of existing supportive practice of participants, enabled the knowledge and confidence of school staff to support CYP experiencing psychological loss to be increased. With positive outcomes for the school setting reported. Implications for further research and EP practice are considered.

T1  - Enhancing Students’ Corresponding Reasoning Of Cognitive Performances By Animated Concept Mapping In Electrochemistry
AN  - 2343736109
AB  - The use of animated concept mapping (ACM) has been linked to an innovative learning skill when conducting students’ guidance of 4 corresponding reasoning processes in electrochemistry. This research aims to establish a new perspective with ACM cognitive reasoning to broaden students’ individual developments of problem-solving skills. It is followed by a quasi-experimental approach of pre-tests, post-tests and retention-tests designed for 274 qualified college students in Taiwan. All data collected from students’ learning performances and feedback is further analyzed by means of achievement covariance, t-tests and one-way ANOVA. Analytical results reveal that ACM facilitates learning comparisons and out-performances in two groups of students in different post-test and retention-test scores. Students’ positive feedback and learning disposition also provide the predominant advantage for participants’ successful reasoning processes. Pedagogical implications suggest that ACM learning performances result in more significant collaborative reasoning.

T1  - Using concept mapping to learn about A level physics students’ understandings of particle physics
AN  - 2285085459
AB  - This article describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students’ understandings of particle physics, which was presented in the Special Session on Physics Education and Outreach at ICNFP 2017. Fifty-nine Year 12 (16- and 17-year-old) students from two London schools participated in the research. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were shown how to make a concept map and were provided with topic-specific key words. Their concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions the students had represented, and comparing these with propositions developed from the examination specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by most of the students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although some students may have been unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks.

T1  - Barriers to using E Learning in an Advanced Way
AN  - 2272188923
AB  - E‑Learning has become a common way to teach and learn. The number of technologies for a variety of educational purposes is already quite high and constantly rising. Scientific experiments and studies increasingly confirm the usefulness of various technologies for teaching purposes. Nevertheless, there is still a lack of formal training and support of digital skills within faculty training. Studies that report the potential of E‑Learning are matched by those reporting the barriers. Universities throughout Europe have now established Learning Management Systems (LMS); instead of using these to their full potential, lecturers often just upload their syllabus and some reading material. At the same time, higher education institutions all over Europe are expected to implement innovative technologies and scenarios such as Open Educational Resources (OER) or Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), but only a small number of universities actually do so. What are the reasons for not utilizing the pedagogic potentials of E‑Learning? What findings does the current research provide on this topic? Which barriers can be derived from studies and what can be done to avoid them? What are the individual barriers of one institution or university? This contribution summarizes barriers that were identified in recent studies and discusses possible solutions to finding connections between barriers to mitigate the negative effects. It also describes a data collection method (group concept mapping) suitable for identifying the individual barriers at an institution or university using a study in the European ERASMUS+ project AduLeT (Advanced Use of Technologies in Higher Education) as an example.

It has been reported that students easily have misconceptions about planets in the solar system because it is hard to imagine the phenomena of outer space. Virtual reality (VR) technology has drawn much attention to virtualizing the scenes in space. However, it is important to help students learn systematically when they learn Astronomy courses in a VR learning environment. Therefore, in this study, a knowledge constructing tool—a concept map to be used as an instant feedback mechanism in a VR system in Astronomy courses—has been developed. Students learn the features and concepts in a VR environment and are guided by an expert concept map. When a student has a misconception, the system will guide him/her to observe the target planet and answer the question again. It is our aim that the proposed approach will enhance students' learning achievement and learning motivation, and decrease their cognitive load. Moreover, the students' learning behavior will be analyzed to understand the effectiveness of this learning approach.

T1  - Identifying the Interpersonal Communication Components of Breast Cancer Care Patient Navigation
AN  - 2165930720
AB  - Background: Patient navigation is an increasingly popular tool used in healthcare to address disparities in cancer care. Interpersonal communication is considered a critically important construct in patient navigation, although it is understudied. Moreover, the patient-navigator relationship may be influenced by the interpersonal communication skills and behaviors of the patient navigator. The primary goal of this dissertation research was to explore the perspectives of key stakeholders (patients, patient navigators and patient navigator administrators) on the interpersonal communication components of breast cancer care patient navigation and the relationship of these components to the patient-navigator relationship.   Methods: This study employed concept mapping, an innovative community-engaged mixed method approach that produces pictorial views of how concepts are interrelated. Key stakeholders participated in study planning and participants completed the concept mapping activities, including brainstorming, sorting, rating, and interpretation. Brainstorming, sorting and rating were completed online. Interpretation took place through in-person sessions separated by participant group.   Results: Thirty-one participants including patients with breast cancer, breast cancer patient navigators and patient navigator administrators from Western Pennsylvania participated. During brainstorming, 121 non-unique items were generated. These statements were combined into one master list of 85 items. After the sorting and rating step, the 85 items were grouped into a six-cluster concept map. Through the group consensus process during the interpretation sessions, the six clusters were named. Diagrams produced by participants noted that all the identified components were essential to patient navigation, but Skills to Build Trust and Patient Centered Relationships and Maintain Professional, Positive and Thoughtful Communication and Care were the most impactful components for promoting the patient-navigator relationship. Results of the rating step showed no notable differences between groups with participants rating Empathetic, Comprehensive and Compassionate Support, Bridge to Clinical Education and Supportive Resources, and Ongoing Individualized Coordination of Care as the most important components for facilitating the patient-navigator relationship.   Conclusion: These findings have both identified and operationalized the emerging interpersonal skills and behaviors of patient navigators in breast cancer care. These identified components can inform the patient navigation role description, competencies, and the development of curriculum for training and metrics for evaluation.

Formative assessment is an exercise meant to enrich teaching-learning process. These methods are used to conduct in-process evaluations of student understanding, learning needs, and academic growth during a course. Formative assessments in engineering course are mostly implemented as assignments, multiple choice question, tests etc. Such methods are not engaging, motivating and does not give instant feedback to teachers to make necessary adjustments to modules and delivery techniques, and academic support. Wireless communication is one of the core telecommunication course which consists of students from computer science, mechanical and electronics engineering. In this course we have implemented two techniques: i) crossword puzzle, ii) concept maps in classroom. In this paper, we report the usage of these two methods as formative assessment techniques as we believe that they can evoke high level of engagement, recall, and retention. Though we have not yet conducted controlled studies for effectiveness evaluation of these formative assessment techniques, feedback response from student's reveals that 78% find the techniques engaging.

T1  - CATEGORY THEORY FOR GENETICS I:MUTATIONS AND SEQUENCE ALIGNMENTS
AN  - 2159266855
AB  - The present article is the first of a series whose goal is to define a logical formalism in which it is possible to reason about genetics. In this paper, we introduce the main concepts of our language whose domain of discourse consists of a class of limit-sketches and their associated models. While our program will aim to show that different phenomena of genetics can be modeled by changing the category in which the models take their values, in this paper, we study models in the category of sets to capture mutation mechanisms such as insertions, deletions, substitutions, duplications and inversions. We show how the proposed formalism can be used for constructing multiple sequence alignments with an emphasis on mutation mechanisms.

T1  - Analysis of Innovative Approaches in the Class Using Conceptual Maps and Considering the Learning Styles of Students
AN  - 2148294300
AB  - This paper presents innovations to stimulate the autonomy of engineering students by using different active methodologies. The strategies designed to address this problem are based on analyzing students’ learning styles and incorporating specific tools into teaching practice, such as “M-eRoDes,” which supports the automatic evaluation and feedback of concept maps created by them. Among the main findings, the students’ assessment of the activity “making concept maps” stands out as useful but not easy. Despite the difficulty, or precisely for that reason, the experience has contributed to improve their autonomy and to develop skills to express the knowledge they have learned.

T1  - Creating Analysis Model by Using Picture Story
AN  - 2139457820
AB  - The creation of an analysis model using Picture Story has a long development history. It may have started from the Context Diagram of Structured Analysis, which was invented by Tom DeMacro in 1970. This was followed by Use Case Diagram, invented by Ivar Jacobson, which was joined with UML in 1995, and an Agile User Story, used to catch the functional requirements of the system. Many researchers have tried to conduct research on the requirement functionality of the system by using a Mind Map or difference tools. In this research, the researcher developed a simple methodology called a Picture Story. This tool to assess the functionality of the system and to create an analysis model using Picture Story and based on human relationships. Then the researcher developed a classical ATM case study; to try out with the second-year computer science students, the Faculty of Applied Science, King Mongkut's University of Technology in North Bangkok in the 2016 academic year. The sample size of 70 students, since the researcher did not classify the group of students, the additional data scores of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) were collected. The Partial Correlation was used to compute the relationship between Scenario and Picture Story while OOP was eliminated. The partial correlation equal to 0.82 and the t-test pair was used to compare the mean between the Scenario and the Picture Story. The mean of Scenario was 9.26, with an SD equal to 5.15 and the mean of the Picture Story was 38.22. The SD was equal to 11.12. The paired t-test of Scenario and Picture Story equalled 21.37 and the p-value for one-tailed was 0.0019; therefore, students claimed that using Picture Story was better than using Scenario in Analysis Class.

T1  - Contemplative Neuroscience as a Gateway to Mindfulness: Findings from an Educationally Framed Teacher Learning Program
AN  - 2135670030
AB  - A growing number of publications have been exploring the possible effects of mindfulness-based interventions on teachers’ well-being and their professional lives. Notwithstanding promising results in this domain, this paper identifies some difficulties involved in introducing teachers to mindfulness and proposes that there may be a need to develop alternative routes by which to expose more teachers to experiences of mindfulness. We report on a mixed method study of a 5-week teacher learning program implemented in an Israeli middle school with 30 teachers, 28 of which were females, with an age range of 29–55. The program was designed to invite teachers into initial experiences with mindfulness without formally engaging in mindfulness practice but rather based on studying education-relevant brain theory through a contemplative pedagogical approach. Outcomes were analyzed quantitatively by comparing collaborative concept maps created by the participants before and after undergoing the program, and qualitatively by analyzing themes extracted from the participants’ discourse. Findings show that the program (a) mobilized teachers from fixed to growth mindsets in regard to their role as educators as reflected in a significant increase in teachers’ beliefs that basic brain abilities are malleable (as extracted from the concept maps, p = 0.004), (b) offered them initial experiences of mindfulness, and (c) possibly opened them to consider more direct approaches to mindfulness practice that are offered in mindfulness-based interventions.

T1  - Teaching to teach systems and networks: preparing to teach for water resilience in the K-12 classroom
AN  - 2124815636
AB  - In K-12 education in the USA, teachers are typically trained to work in content area silos. This structure shapes how teacher certification is organized as well. Biology, chemistry, economics, and urban planning are each considered distinct disciplines. Although there are some benefits to this approach in terms of focus and scope, there are also limits. Deeply integrated topics such as water resilience require a more unified and interdisciplinary pedagogical approach. This paper describes work done to train new science teachers to utilize systems and network models through the use of concept mapping to reconstruct their thinking and understanding of such topics. These teachers were then asked to create appropriate unit and lesson plans that reflected these system and network models. Preliminary findings suggest that educators who participated in this training were better able to teach deeply integrated topics to their K-12 students in more meaningful and productive ways.

T1  - Using concept mapping to measure changes in interdisciplinary learning during high school
AN  - 2121706950
AB  - How, when and what kind of learning takes place are key questions in all educational environments. School graduates are expected to have reached a development level whereby they have, among many fundamental skills, the ability to think critically, to plan their studies and their future, and to integrate knowledge across disciplines. However, it is challenging to develop these skills in schools. Following existing curricula, disciplines are often taught separately and by different teachers, making it difficult for students to connect knowledge studied and learned from one discipline to that of another discipline. The Next Generation Science Standards on teaching and learning natural science in the United States point out important crosscutting concepts in science education (NGSS, 2013). In Estonia, similar trends are leading to an emphasis on the need to further develop scientific literacy skills and interdisciplinary learning in students. The changing environment around us must be reflected in changes in our school system. In this paper, we report on research that intends to answer the questions (a) “How much do Estonian students develop an interdisciplinary understanding of science throughout their high school education?”, and (b) “Is their thinking more interdisciplinary after two years of studies in an Estonian high school?” Additionally, we analyzed the results based on the type of school the students attended, and we examined the use concept mapping to assess interdisciplinary learning. This research is part of an overall study that involved students from 44 Estonian high schools taking a science test similar to the three-dimensional Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) test (hereafter called PISA-like multidimensional test) as well as constructing concept maps, while in 10th and 12th grade. In this paper, we report on the analysis of the results for 182 of the students, concentrating on the analysis of the concept maps they constructed. The results suggest that there were changes in the students’ interdisciplinary knowledge, but these were small and varied depending on the students’ school type. They also suggest that changes may be needed in the Estonian educational system to increase the students’ level of interdisciplinary understanding of science.

T1  - Teachers’ Use of Focus Questions in German Biology Classrooms: a Video-based Naturalistic Study
AN  - 2115778997
AB  - This study investigated the effects of teachers’ use of focus questions on students’ knowledge structures and classroom teaching-learning process by re-analyzing selected data from a quasi-experimental pre-post video study (Wadouh, 2007). Focus questions are content-related anchoring questions highlighting the key content taught in individual lessons (Forbes & Davis, 2010). In Wadouh’ study, students answered a knowledge test before and after the lesson on “blood and the circulatory system” and one lesson per teacher was videotaped to investigate teaching practices in grade 9 biology classrooms. Students also completed a post-unit concept mapping exercise and a motivation-interest questionnaire. In this study, 30 lesson videos selected from 47 were re-analyzed for teachers’ use of focus questions—no focus questions, non-specific or simple focus questions, and specific and challenging focus questions. Individual students’ scores in the concept mapping exercise were aggregated as students’ topic-related knowledge structure. Multilevel analyses revealed a significant positive effect of teachers’ use of specific and challenging focus questions on students’ topic-related knowledge structure. Furthermore, a comparative case analysis of the classroom teaching-learning process was conducted in four lessons where teachers used specific and challenging focus questions in two of the lessons and non-specific or simple focus questions in the other two lessons. The findings indicate that specific and challenging focus questions anchored lessons on students’ co-construction of scientific explanations by activating their pre-instructional ideas, whereas non-specific or simple focus questions anchored lessons on their accumulation of canonical scientific knowledge. This study’s limitations and implications for teacher education reform are discussed.

The learners' interaction and contents in online discussion forum could also be as important elements to evaluate the learning. The paper proposes a framework of concept map derived from forum (CMF) to analyze online discussion forum in Moodle. The framework analyzes the interaction among peers and posts, which facilitates effective knowledge organization by constructing relationships between forum contents and existing knowledge. The framework extracts the learning difficulties and visualized with word clouds in online forum. The research contributes to bridging the gap between teaching materials and students' questions from online forum. The CMF framework is helpful to design the architecture of automatically answer system and real-time feedback within adaptive learning in the future.

T1  - Examination of the preservice chemistry teachers’ understanding of periodic table concepts
AN  - 2097996154
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the preservice chemistry teachers’ understanding of periodic table concepts and some atomic properties. The study group of this study was comprised of 17 preservice chemistry teachers who were undergraduate students at a public University. The preservice teachers’ ages are between 19 and 26, and the mean is 21.12 (SD=1.83). In addition, the 14 of the preservice teachers are female and three are male. In the study, concept maps and lotus blossom technique were used as data collection tools in order to determine the understanding of preservice chemistry teachers about the periodic table concepts. Data obtained through these techniques was analysed to figure out the useful of these assessment tools. The results of the analysis indicated that preservice teachers have limited understanding of the periodic table and its properties. In addition, at the end of the study, it was determined that they have many misunderstanding.

T1  - Exploring Nursing Instructors' Experiences With Implementing Concept Maps in the Classroom
AN  - 2086420585
AB  - Concept mapping is an active learning strategy found to be beneficial to nursing students. A gap in the literature was present regarding faculty experiences with implementing concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this basic qualitative study was to investigate the experience of nursing instructors in the classroom setting who routinely used concept mapping in teaching their nursing courses. The sample consisted of eight participants who held at least a master’s degree in nursing and taught in one of the two-year community college nursing programs in the Northeastern United States. The study entailed the use of six guided interview questions in semi-structured format and using a constant comparative approach to data analysis, which led to the development of three themes. The initial experiences with concept maps theme addressed how nursing instructors became aware of concept mapping. The experiences related to implementing concept maps theme addressed positive and negative issues related to the practice of implementing concept maps. The experiences of nursing faculty were associated with factors that promoted meaningful learning for their students leading to the final theme of promoting meaningful learning, which was further supported by three subthemes. The critical thinking subtheme addressed the benefit of concept maps among students in developing higher cognitive thinking. The connecting the classroom to the clinical setting  subtheme addressed students’ use of concept maps in interconnecting information taught in class within the clinical learning environment. The  understanding nursing content subtheme indicated that nursing students had a better comprehension of information with the development of concept maps. One implication to current practice includes nursing faculty to add concept mapping in the classroom setting, which improves learner’s ability to add new knowledge to that they already have and begin to interconnect all information thereby promoting meaningful learning. Future research recommendations include studies on the training of faculty, the timing with implementing concept maps, using a larger sample size, and to conduct a study outside of the community college setting. Future quantitative studies could address the congruency between the subthemes of critical thinking and understanding nursing content. A final recommendation is to conduct a mixed-method study to quantify nursing instructors’ experiences using concept mapping.

T1  - A Grounded Theory of Urinary Incontinence Using a Transcultural Perspective
AN  - 2046899765
AB  - Background: Urinary incontinence (UI) is both a common and costly condition confronted in nursing and indeed the healthcare system worldwide. While UI is often considered a natural consequence of aging, there are physiological, psychological, and quality-of-life implications for all of those individuals living with UI. Sadly, UI often is ignored or stigmatized and becomes a taboo issue within most cultures.    Purpose: To better understand UI and develop a definition of significance for nursing and to understand the experience of nurses caring for persons with UI across cultures (China and U.S.) through developing grounded theory, this research was framed using Leininger (1991) Culture Care Diversity and Universality Theory. The dissertation includes three research papers.    Methods: The first study conducted is a concept analysis of urinary incontinence using the techniques of Rodgers (1989, 2000). The second and third studies use Corbin and Strauss' (2008, 2015) grounded theory methods to examine hospital nurses' perceptions as well as the management of UI in China (n=6) and the U.S (n=11). Semi-structured interview format was used to collect data and apply the methods.    Findings: The first study is entitled Urinary Incontinence: A Concept Analysis produced holistic definition that elucidates the nuances and complexities of the patient with UI as well as a concept map. The second study is entitled Perceptions and Management of Patients with Urinary Incontinence Among Chinese Hospital Nurses identified several key themes emerged including the demedicalization of UI, the novice-to-expert trajectory of nurse's in UI care skill acquisition, and general lack of formal education. The study also highlighted the fact that UI is a multifarious issue (core category); there are many etiologies, management modalities, and treatment options. The third study entitled Perceptions and Management of Patients with Urinary Incontinence Among American Hospital Nurses is similar to the qualitative study conducted in China and was developed to allow for a transcultural perspective on the issue to occur. The core category was identified as being the multifarious nature of UI. The themes that emerged were the novice-to-expert trajectory of nurses, age and acceptability of UI, psychological impacts of UI, and lack of education. The three studies were then used to develop a grounded theory of urinary incontinence.    Conclusion: The studies identified diversities and universalities between Chinese and American hospital nurses. The processes of taking action and making sense were elucidated. Finally, a comprehensive model of the nurse's management of the patient with UI is proposed. This grounded theory model synthesizes the concept analysis if UI which highlights the micro-level factors, while the grounded theory studies informed the macroscopic level of processes.

T1  - ‘Sometimes They Are Fun and Sometimes They Are Not’: Concept Mapping with English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Gifted/Talented (GT) Elementary Students Learning Science and Sustainability
AN  - 2026662124
AB  - This study presents an ‘education for sustainability’ curricular model which promotes science learning in an elementary classroom through equity pedagogy. A total of 25 fourth-grade students from an urban, public school in Denver, Colorado participated in this mixed-methods study where concept maps were used as a tool for describing and assessing students’ understanding of ecosystem interactions. Concept maps provide a more holistic, systems-based assessment of science learning in a sustainability curriculum. The concept maps were scored and analyzed using SPSS to investigate potential differences in learning gains of English Language Acquisition (ELA) and Gifted/Talented (GT) students. Interviews were conducted after the concept maps were administered, then transcribed and inductively coded to generate themes related to science learning. Interviews also encouraged students to explain their drawings and provided a more accurate interpretation of the concept maps. Findings revealed the difference between pre- and post-concept map scores for ELA and GT learners were not statistically significant. Students also demonstrated an increased knowledge of ecosystem interactions during interviews. Concept maps, as part of an education for sustainability curriculum, can promote equity by providing diverse learners with different-yet equally valid-outlets to express their scientific knowledge.

T1  - Interactive Videos Enhance Learning about Socio-Ecological Systems
AN  - 2013186713
AB  - Two forms of interactive video were assessed in an online course focused on conservation. The hypothesis was that interactive video enhances student perceptions about learning and improves mental models of social-ecological systems. Results showed that students reported greater learning and attitudes toward the subject following interactive video. Moreover, metrics of network complexity applied to students' concept maps of socio-ecological systems increased longitudinally through the course highlighting greater awareness of socio-ecological linkages. We conclude that interactive video can increase awareness of interdisciplinary connections in socio-ecological systems and should be more widely employed in general education geography courses.

T1  - Collaborative information searching as learning in academic group work
AN  - 1992871425
AB  - PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to explore users' learning in the collaborative information search process when they conduct an academic task as a group.Design/methodology/approachThis paper presents a longitudinal study for a three-month period on an actual task. The participants, who were undergraduate students, needed to write a research proposal in three months to apply for funding for a research project, including a three-hour experiment.FindingsThe results show that undergraduates' learning in the collaborative search process for academic group work included knowledge reconstruction, tuning, and assimilation. Their understanding of the topic concepts improved through the process, and their attitudes became more optimistic. Besides, the learning in the collaborative information search process also enhanced participants' skills in communication, research, information search, and collaboration. To improve learning outcomes, professional and appropriate academic resources are required, as well as effective division of labor, positive sharing behaviors, and use of collaborative systems.Practical implicationsThe future development of collaborative information search systems should focus on the needs of academic research and support for elements such as instant communication and knowledge sharing.Originality/valueThis paper contributes to research into searching as learning by understanding undergraduates' collaborative search behavior for writing a proposal.

T1  - Early Childhood Teachers' Concepts of Constructivist Teaching and Learning
AN  - 2021240603
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate early childhood teachers' understanding of "Constructivist teaching and learning in early childhood education." Twenty early childhood teachers in a graduate school at a university in Busan participated in this study. To look into the teachers' concepts and knowledge, the participants were required to make concept maps twice. Analysis of the mapping showed 84 superordinate concepts and "Constructivist teaching and learning," "Theoretical background," "Core components of constructivism," "Teaching and learning practice," "The principle of the constructivist classroom" were the most frequently mentioned by the participants. "Teacher" was far less observed than the other superordinate concepts. The characteristics of superordinate concepts were analyzed. "Core components of constructivism" had the most number of subordinate concepts and recorded the highest specificity score. The results were discussed in relation to the implication for constructivist teacher education.

T1  - Student Engagement with a Flipped Classroom Teaching Design Affects Pharmacology Examination Performance in a Manner Dependent on Question Type
AN  - 2051219790
AB  - To investigate the relationship between student engagement with the key elements of a flipped classroom approach (preparation and attendance), their attitudes to learning, including strategy development, and their performance on two types of examination questions (knowledge recall and providing rational predictions when faced with novel scenarios). This study correlated student engagement with the flipped classroom and student disposition to learning with student ability to solve novel scenarios in examinations. Students who both prepared for and attended classes performed significantly better on examination questions that required analysis of novel scenarios compared to students who did not prepare and missed classes. However, there was no difference for both groups of students on examination questions that required knowledge and comprehension. Student motivation and use of strategies correlated with higher examination scores on questions requiring novel scenario analysis. There is a synergistic relationship between class preparation and attendance. The combination of preparation and attendance was positively correlated to assessment type; the relationship was apparent for questions requiring students to solve novel problems but not for questions requiring knowledge or comprehension.

T1  - An Educational Data Mining Approach to Concept Map Construction for Web based Learning
AN  - 1986079250
AB  - This aim of this article is to study the use of Educational Data Mining (EDM) techniques in constructing concept maps for organizing knowledge in web based learning systems whereby studying their synergistic effects in enhancing learning. This article first provides a tutorial based introduction to EDM. The applicability of web based learning systems in enhancing the efficiency of EDM techniques in real time environment is investigated. Web based learning systems often use a tool for organizing knowledge. This article explores the use of one such tool called concept map for this purpose. The pioneering works by various researchers who proposed web based learning systems in personalized and collaborative environment in this arena are next presented. A set of parameters are proposed based on which personalized and collaborative learning applications may be generalized and their performances compared. It is found that personalized learning environment uses EDM techniques more exhaustively compared to collaborative learning for concept map construction in web based environment. This article can be used as a starting point for freshers who would like to use EDM techniques for concept map construction for web based learning purposes.

T1  - A Semantic Representation of the Knowledge Management Enablers Domain: The aKMEOnt Ontology
AN  - 1967768215
AB  - Knowledge management is a significant driver for any enterprise development and evolution as it is engaged with planning, implementing, controlling, monitoring and improving enterprise's processes and systems. However, organisations are still at a disadvantage when applying knowledge management in a real environment. A resourced-based view of knowledge management stimulates the consideration of knowledge management enablers (KMEs) as factors that should be employed during the development and implementation of knowledge management systems. Using organisations' KMEs is critical for understanding how knowledge is created, shared, disseminated and upgraded in order to better respond to the dynamic environment. They are also essential to identify available assets and resources and clarify how an organisation's capabilities are created and utilised. Sustaining these KMEs and applying them in systematic modes and business processes requires a generic overview of these KMEs and the relationship between them. The semantic representation of the KMEs domain can be an attractive approach to meet this demand. Using ontologies facilitates the semantic representation of the KMEs and provides a shared understanding of knowledge among individuals in the organisation. This paper proposes the employment of an abstract KMEs ontology (aKMEOnt) that formally defines an essential pillar of the knowledge management domain. Organisation structure, culture, information technology, leadership, knowledge context and business repository have been selected as representatives to define the KMEs domain. Each of the selected KMEs has a set of concepts that characterises its domain. The whole concept map of these KMEs has been developed to depict the concepts and their relationships in the KMEs domain. Based on the concept map of the KMEs, the aKMEOnt, including its classes and properties is implemented using the Protégé tool and Ontology Web Language-Description Logic (OWL-DL).The aKMEOnt is important to explicitly manage and control the flow of knowledge in the organisation, and, in addition, it can be integrated with potential semantic representation of other related disciplines.

T1  - The trilayer approach of teaching physiology, pathophysiology, and pharmacology concepts in a first-year pharmacy course: the TLAT model
AN  - 1956034289
AB  - This paper describes the development, implementation, and students' perceptions of a new trilayer approach of teaching (TLAT). The TLAT model involved blending lecture, in-class group activities, and out-of-class assignments on selected content areas and was implemented initially in a first-year integrated pharmacy course. Course contents were either delivered by traditional lectures or by the TLAT. A survey instrument was distributed by SurveyMonkey to determine students' perceptions of the TLAT model. Descriptive statistics were used for data analysis. Students' performance in a total of 225 examination and quiz questions was analyzed to evaluate whether the TLAT model improved students' learning. Students' (n = 98) performance scores for TLAT-based and lecture-based questions were 83.3 ± 10.2 and 79.5 ± 14.0, respectively (P < 0.05). Ninety-three percent of students believed that in-class group activities enhanced conceptual understanding of course materials, helped them take responsibility of their own learning, and enhanced their overall learning experiences. More than 80% of respondents felt that solving cases and developing concept maps helped them sharpen creative and critical thinking skills. In addition, 90% of the respondents indicated that the homework throughout the semester helped them stay up to date and focused with the progress of the course. The use of the TLAT model led to an improvement in student learning of complex concepts. Moreover, the results suggest that this model improves students' self-reliance and attitudes toward learning. Our findings should serve as an impetus for inclusion of diverse active learning strategies in pharmacy education.

T1  - Pharmacology Goes Concept-Based: Course Design, Implementation, and Evaluation
AN  - 1933185202
AB  - Although concept-based curricula are frequently discussed in the nursing education literature, little information exists to guide the development of a concept-based pharmacology course. Traditionally, nursing pharmacology courses are taught with an emphasis on drug class where a prototype drug serves as an exemplar. When transitioning pharmacology to a concept-based course, special considerations are in order. How can educators successfully integrate essential pharmacological content into a curriculum structured around nursing concepts? This article presents one approach to the design and implementation of a concept-based undergraduate pharmacology course. Planning methods, supportive teaching strategies, and course evaluation procedures are discussed.

T1  - The Effects of a Collaborative Computer-based Concept Mapping Strategy on Geographic Science Performance in Junior High School Students
AN  - 2786531050
AB  - This study explored the effects of a collaborative computer-based concept mapping strategy on Geographic Science learning outcomes in junior high school students. A quasi-experimental approach was applied to a sample of 85 9th grade students. Class instruction lasted for five weeks, with two classes each week. Using the quasi-experimental research approach, 27 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM), 28 students were assigned to a group that received individual computer-based concept mapping (CBCM) assisted instruction, and 30 students were assigned to a group that received collaborative computer-based concept mapping (CCBCM) assisted instruction. We explored the impact of these methods of instruction on students’ memorization, understanding, and application of concepts and on their higher order cognitive ability. The findings revealed that the CCBCM and CBCM groups scored better than the NCM group on the post-test. On the retention test, the CCBCM group outperformed the NCM group on all subtests.

T1  - Analyzing the Use of Concept Maps in Computer Science: A Systematic Mapping Study
AN  - 2039204823
AB  - Context: concept Maps (CMs) enable the creation of a schematic representation of a domain knowledge. For this reason, CMs have been applied in different research areas, including Computer Science. Objective: the objective of this paper is to present the results of a systematic mapping study conducted to collect and evaluate existing research on CMs initiatives in Computer Science. Method: the mapping study was performed by searching five electronic databases. We also performed backward snowballing and manual search to find publications of researchers and research groups that accomplished these studies. Results: from the mapping study, we identified 108 studies addressing CMs initiatives in different subareas of Computer Science that were reviewed to extract relevant information to answer a set of research questions. The mapping shows an increasing interest in the topic in recent years and it has been extensively investigated due to support in teaching and learning. Conclusions: based on our results we conclude that the use of CMs as an educational tool has been widely accepted in Computer Science.

AN  - 2036982850
AB  - Nowadays all countries aim to reach efficient education system. In the current scenario, problems of education system can only be controlled by qualified people. So, for the fruitful learning, teaching approaches, procedures, practices and tools should transfer knowledge in a way that can be inspected from different dimensions enlightening a lot of points of view, situations, and depiction of idea creation. In this way, it can be stated that one of the most important teaching and learning tool that promote meaningful learning is concept maps. The Concept mapping as a tool has gained a lot of recognition and acknowledgement in science education, both in the practice and in the literature as well. But how concept mapping is seen in the teaching profession is the aim of this research and how much beneficial and effective concept maps are in teaching learning process. Interviews were conducted from teachers. Results of the study involving 10 teachers of international Islamic university revealed that nowadays concept map is an efficient teaching tool in the classrooms used by teacher and its effectiveness can be measured through prevailing learning environment, increased student participation and understanding level of students. It also shows the advantages and some perceived difficulties associated with concept maps. The research was descriptive and focused on the understanding and specifics of experiences. Results of study led to the conclusion that at higher level the university teachers need to be aware of new and interesting teaching tools as concept map which can leave positive effects on students learning and may be used frequently in the classrooms for providing better understanding.

T1  - Meta-analysis on the study with concept maps on the medical field
AN  - 2020466865
AB  - The present study wants to see if and to what extent, the type of teaching and learning according to the concept maps method has an effect in the medical field and predominantly in teaching anatomy. In this respect, a total of 13 relevant articles have been searched for and found. As a measuring tool the results obtained by the authors were used as grades or scores obtained by testing on experimental vs. control groups. The overall effect was measured for the preclinical and clinical domains, after which relevant factors were sought that could mediate, in one way or another, the overall effect. From our data we found enhanced effects evident both in general and in both of the mentioned fields, so as to, of the mediating factors, to be noticed among others, particularly the actual teaching of concept maps, which by its duration could ease or, conversely, hinder the learning process.

T1  - An experiment in mind-mapping and argument-mapping: Tools for assessing outcomes in the business curriculum
AN  - 2002967012
AB  - Distinguished from other teaching-learning tools, such as mind and concept mapping in which students draw pictures and concepts and show relationships and correlation between them to demonstrate their own understanding of complex concepts, argument mapping is used to demonstrate clarity of reasoning, based on supporting evidence, and come to a conclusion, which enhances business decision making skills, a common learning outcome in the business curriculum. In this study on business education, argument mapping was demonstrated as an effective methodology to assess student learning and conceptualization of a business and as a useful classroom activity to present a business problem and have students develop business solutions, as individuals or in groups. The paper describes classroom-based evidence from an introductory business course, in which students developed an argument map and then shared their work to stimulate discussion about the business problem/argument to be solved and appropriate business decisions to make.

T1  - Online Collaborative Misconception Mapping Strategy Enhanced Health Science Students' Discussion and Knowledge of Basic Statistical Concepts
AN  - 1924517995
AB  - Online discussions have become inherent components of both faceto-face and distance education college courses, yet they often fail to provide much benefit to students ' learning outcomes. One reason behind this phenomenon is the lack of or inadequate scaffolding or guidance provided to students when participating on asynchronous discussion boards. Although some existing tools and strategies may encourage meaningful academic discussions by eliciting conflict among students, scientific concepts do not always lend themselves to such discourse. Instead, collaborative activities in the area of science need to incorporate the co-critiquing of a flawed external source, with appropriate scaffolding to also benefit students with low self-regulation levels by mediating cognitive and metacognitive processes. The authors designed and tested such a tool, termed Collaborative Misconception Mapping (CMM), which combines the positive effects of concept mapping and the Questioning the Author comprehension strategy. Compared with a discussion-questions based online activity, the use of the online CMM strategy lead to more meaningful discussions, as well as increased knowledge of basic statistical concepts.

T1  - Assessing conceptual mapping based active learning for advancing engineering diagnostic skills
AN  - 2317828401
AB  - Active learning differs from traditional instructional pedagogy by emphasizing student activities and engagement in the learning process. The most frequently discussed types of active learning are collaborative learning, co-operative learning, and problem-based learning. Various studies have shown that active learning is gaining attention in the education community, and increases student performance in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, or STEM subjects.
Critical thinking and problem solving are fundamental skills that are coveted by employers of engineering graduates. Both require students to demonstrate not only solid domain knowledge, but the application of the knowledge in addressing real-world problems. Active learning, with its common forms, is ideal to blend pertinent curriculum elements to help students develop the highly-sought abilities. The issues now become: a) identifying the proper problem to provide context and motivation; and b) finding the technical vehicle for student engagement and assessment. For the first issue, we have found that providing accurate and timely diagnosis for system failures or malfunctions is a common theme in many STEM, in particular engineering and technology disciplines, and embodies the culmination of the aforementioned skills. For the second issue where students' mastery of the skills is to be demonstrated and evaluated, we believe concept maps are a fitting tool because of their use of both content and process knowledge to create visual maps of a diagnostic strategy to identify technical problems.
From 2012 to 2015, the National Science Foundation funded the Advancing Diagnostic Skills Training in the Undergraduate Technology and Engineering Curriculum at Indiana State University. The work was to experiment with using conceptual mapping to help undergraduates become more “flexible thinkers” relative to technical problem solving. For research purposes, we focused our attention on the diagnostic phase of technical troubleshooting. The modules were tested at five institutions and by over one hundred students in engineering technology programs. In this paper we collage student and faculty feedback, both qualitatively and quantitatively, from these trials. Furthermore, through these data we will present our analysis and assessment of concept map based approach in improving student critical thinking skills and more broadly, the effectiveness of active learning in increasing student performance in STEM.

T1  - Introduction to Deep Learning: A First Course in Machine Learning
AN  - 2317828202
AB  - Introduction to Deep Learning A First Course in Machine Learning
Deep learning is a special type of machine learning that can take advantage of the growing availability of big data and the increasing computing power of GPUs. Deep learning is responsible for the dramatic improvements seen in recent years in speech and image recognition and is the key enabling technology behind self-driving cars. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook and China's Biadu are investing heavily in research and development in deep learning. Applications of deep learning are growing rapidly.
In this article, I describe an undergraduate course on deep learning that I am currently teaching for the first time at Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology. (I have taught 70% of the course.) Most of the students in the course are junior and senior computer science majors. Nearly all the students have not had a previous course in machine learning. The deep learning course is problem driven and builds on basic concepts students learn in calculus, statistics and probability. Key concepts from machine learning, e.g. the cardinal sin of overfitting, are introduced in the context of deep learning in a problem driven manner so that students discover and observe these concepts for themselves. Google's recently open-sourced deep learning software package, TensorFlow, is heavily used thoughout the course. Students are required to complete a deep learning project of their choice.
A detailed concept map as well as online resources and data sets used for the course are described in the paper.

T1  - The Retention and Usefulness of Concept Maps as Advance Organizers
AN  - 2317822376
AB  - Concept maps are node-link diagrams designed to visualize the topics and relationships between topics that represent a person’s knowledge in a given subject area. Though concept maps were originally conceived as a way to visualize student understanding, concept maps were quickly found to serve as powerful learning tools as well. Concept maps can be used for learning in two ways: they can be student generated after instruction to get students to reflect on what they have learned, or they can be expert generated and used as an overview before more detailed instruction. When expert generated concept maps are used to preface more detailed instruction, they are being used as an advance organizer, presenting a high level overview of information to come in an easy to understand format.
Previous work has shown that concept maps can be powerful advance organizers that enhance student learning. This is presumably because the students internalize the expert maps and use them as scaffolds for subsequent learning, but little work has been done to examine this intermediate step. This work seeks to fill the gap in the literature by specifically examining if expert generated maps presented as advance organizers are internalized by students in an engineering mechanics classroom.
To determine if and how concept maps are internalized when used as advance organizers, a comparison was made between statics students in an experimental group, where concept maps were presented at the beginning of each day’s lecture, and multiple control groups, where concept maps were not presented at the beginning of lecture. For selected subsets of the course material, the instructors of each group were asked to make a concept map of those topics (for the experimental group this matches the concept maps presented in class). At least one month after completing their statics course, participating students were then also asked to create concept maps of the same topic areas. Student concept maps (novice maps) were then compared to their instructor’s maps (expert maps) and a quantitative measure of similarity between the students and instructors was calculated. It was hypothesized that the experimental group, with regular exposure to the expert generated concept maps, would organize their own concept maps in ways that more closely match their instructor’s maps. In addition to concept map similarity measures, a set of relationship questions was also included as part of data collection. This set of questions, developed collaboratively by all the involved instructors, sought to explore student conceptual understanding of the relationships between key topics in engineering statics. The collected data was then scrubbed by one researcher before being blindly evaluated by a second researcher for correctness. The results were then re-identified and overall trends in relationship understanding were examined though the lens of the course sections and in relation to the student generated concept map patterns.
The results of the data collection and analysis are presented, and the implications of the findings are discussed from a theoretical and practical standpoint.

T1  - Assessment of Student Learning Outcomes and ABET Accreditation: A Pilot Study of Fourth-Year Engineering Students using Longitudinal Concept Maps
AN  - 2317813756
AB  - The events surrounding Chernobyl, Three-mile Island, Challenger, and Bhopal prompted calls for a more rigorous call for engineering training. Professional societies representing engineers supported more innovative accreditation criteria to include ethics, global context, and understanding engineering problems as technical-social challenges with complex solutions. Pressure from global events and professional engineering societies contributed to ABET issuing the Engineering Criteria (EC) 2000. Those criteria signaled a shift to make non-technical criteria more explicit, diverse, and extend beyond communication skills. Engineering schools were tasked with developing assessment programs for fulfilling the new EC 2000 criteria and are again faced with a new set of criteria with the recently proposed amendments. Student portfolios are often a proxy for comprehensive learning or exams act as indicators of knowledge acquisition. However, there are few shared resources across institutions that are robust, malleable, and don’t require considerable effort by students, faculty and staff to create and codify. Engineering schools are challenged to attribute student outcomes for broader social context to specific curricular or course-design elements and then situate this attribution to overall progress for accreditation. This project introduces a pilot study using concept maps (cmaps) as an assessment technique that is useful for understanding learning over time, pedagogical influences between sections of a course, and mechanism to link to ABET criteria. Data was collected from 78 students completing three sequential maps out of a 590 person senior class conducted as a yearlong course in ‘Science, Technology and Society’ at the University of Virginia. One of two technical artifacts was used as a shared starting point on three occasions (August 2015, December 2015, and May 2016) with small amounts of class time allocated for the exercise. The cmaps were coded for 14 categories and analyzed with paired t-tests to identify key areas where students demonstrated significant learning outcomes changes over time. The findings illustrate how students articulate significantly greater technical knowledge and increased societal complexity in regards to a given material artifact. Pedagogical choices and course goals are matched to ABET criteria and supported by statistically significant correlations. Two focus groups offered a qualitative reflection upon the methodology and student outcomes. This method supports rigorous, but still flexible, means of linking ABET criteria for ethical and societal context to evaluation, assessment, student outcomes, and program objectives. This study suggests how concept mapping can be deployed and analyzed in a manner that offers compelling results between pre- and post-tests and offers a systematic means to assess ABET EC 2000 criteria by evaluators from across the country. We discuss limitations of timing, rule following, and interdisciplinary differences that warrant further systematic investigation.

T1  - Subject-specific science teachers' views of alternative assessment *
AN  - 2067963414
AB  - This study aimed to discover subject-specific science teachers' views of alternative assessment. The questionnaire by Okur (2008) was adapted and deployed for data collection. The sample consisted of 80 subject-specific science teachers drawn from the cities of Trabzon, Rize and Erzurum in Turkey. In analyzing data, descriptive analysis was employed for identifying how often the subject-specific science teachers use the alternative assessment and which of the alternative assessment techniques are frequently preferred. Also, how gender variable affects their preference and/or self-competency was analyzed via independent samples t-test. In light of the results, it can be deduced that the subject-specific science teachers tended to use such traditional assessment techniques as multiple choice test, concept map, written test, and matching test. Further, the main barrier to involve the alternative assessment in science classes seems to be the high-staking nation-wide exams in Turkey that deploy only multiple-choice questions. Therefore, any change in assessment strategy of the high-staking nation-wide exams may foster teachers to enrich their preferences of alternative assessment and empower its possible use in science classes.

T1  - AB1113 Patient participation is crucial when introducing new device technologies in the management of chronic arthritis: applying the parker model, a qualitative 3-step approach
AN  - 2033802479
AB  - Background
Patients' participation in design, development, and implementation of new device technologies is essential to ensure added value in patients' disease management.
Objectives
To explore the applicability and relevance of ava®, an electromechanical device (e-Device), as an alternative method for subcutaneous administration of certolizumab pegol.
Methods
The Parker Model is an innovative 3-step qualitative research approach, which combined concept mapping (CM), participatory design (PD), and stakeholder evaluation (SE) to evaluate the e-Device (Figure). CM was applied through workshops, with the participation of patients, using a structured group process focusing on relevant themes to identify issues and concerns with the e-Device. Patients used this information in a series of iterative PD sessions; patients participated in 3 interactive sessions to create a personal e-Device prototype in cooperation with a designer and a medical expert. This was followed by a common group session. Finally, SE was performed based on semi-structured group and individual interviews with patients and disease-management stakeholders.
Results
The study included 9 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 4 psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients, 1 ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patient, 2 doctors, 2 nurses, 1 medical secretary, and 4 key public servants involved in the disease management of the selected rheumatic diseases. Saturation was reached after 3 CM patient workshops, generating 121 statements, which were organized by the participants into themes. Through content analysis of the results from the 3 workshops, 4 concepts were generated: technical usability, physical design, concerns, and enthusiasm. These data were used in the iterative PD sessions, resulting in 4 new proposed prototypes. Finally, SE demonstrated that the identified concepts were pivotal for both facilitating and hampering device implementation, thus creating value when introducing the new e-Device.
Conclusions
Patient participation in the 3-step qualitative Parker Model identified important aspects to consider when designing and implementing an innovative device for the treatment and management of RA, PsA, and AS. This is the first time a composite, qualitative research model has been applied when introducing a new device to support these disease areas. The responses from patients and disease-management stakeholders indicated that it is key to include patient input in the design and adaptation of devices alongside education and communication with stakeholders. These resources can help ensure added value when developing devices for the management of RA, PsA, and AS using biologic medicines.

T1  - Science Outside the Lab: Helping Graduate Students in Science and Engineering Understand the Complexities of Science Policy
AN  - 1906358728
AB  - Helping scientists and engineers challenge received assumptions about how science, engineering, and society relate is a critical cornerstone for macroethics education. Scientific and engineering research are frequently framed as first steps of a value-free linear model that inexorably leads to societal benefit. Social studies of science and assessments of scientific and engineering research speak to the need for a more critical approach to the noble intentions underlying these assumptions. "Science Outside the Lab" is a program designed to help early-career scientists and engineers understand the complexities of science and engineering policy. Assessment of the program entailed a pre-, post-, and 1 year follow up survey to gauge student perspectives on relationships between science and society, as well as a pre-post concept map exercise to elicit student conceptualizations of science policy. Students leave Science Outside the Lab with greater humility about the role of scientific expertise in science and engineering policy; greater skepticism toward linear notions of scientific advances benefiting society; a deeper, more nuanced understanding of the actors involved in shaping science policy; and a continued appreciation of the contributions of science and engineering to society. The study presents an efficacious program that helps scientists and engineers make inroads into macroethical debates, reframe the ways in which they think about values of science and engineering in society, and more thoughtfully engage with critical mediators of science and society relationships: policy makers and policy processes.

T1  - Kind discipline: Developing a conceptual model of a promising school discipline approach
AN  - 1901766437
AB  - This formative evaluation develops a novel conceptual model for a discipline approach fostering intrinsic motivation and positive relationships in schools. We used concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on kind discipline from teachers, administrators, and other school staff. Three core themes describing kind discipline emerged from 11 identified clusters: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. We mapped the identified components of kind discipline onto a social ecological model and found that kind discipline encompasses all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed. Products of the analysis and synthesis reported here are operationalized materials for teachers grounded in a "be kind" culture code for classrooms.

T1  - Changes in science teachers' conceptions and connections of STEM concepts and earthquake engineering
AN  - 2439244243
AB  - The authors find justification for integrating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) in the complex problems that today's students will face as tomorrow's STEM professionals. Teachers with individual subject-area specialties in the STEM content areas have limited experience in integrating STEM. In this study, the authors investigated the conceptual changes of secondary school teachers teaching domain-specific STEM courses after a week-long professional development experience integrating earthquake engineering and domain-specific concepts. They documented and then triangulated outcomes of the experience using participating teachers' concept maps and teacher-generated written materials, respectively. Statistical comparisons of participants' concept maps revealed significant increases in their overall understanding of earthquake engineering and more accurate linkages with and among science domain-specific concepts. Content analyses of teachers' learning products confirmed the concept map analysis and also provided evidence of transfer of workshop learning experiences into teacher-designed curriculum products accurately linking earthquake engineering and domain-specific STEM content knowledge.

T1  - Transplanting and Manipulating Context from a Corpus: A Pre-writing Strategy
AN  - 1917334371
AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the impact of transferring and contriving the perspective and message from a collection of written or spoken text, in the context of teaching English writing as foreign d language. The entire research was conducted with a view to create a writing strategy for use in the popular EFL workbook, New Interchange 3. The research further developed into concept mapping the learners' ability at a pre-writing stage on English as a foreign language (EFL) to generate better argumentative essays. On the basis of the results achieved through analytical and experimental case study, the paper intended to design a course plan for the non-native learners of English in the TEFL Writing classes at the College of Languages and Translation, King Saud University. The paper further evaluated and examined the usefulness of the language tools of corpus, collocation and context as pre-writing strategies. It has been the desired objective of the researcher to observe, analyze, and establish the importance of corpus, collocation and context (C3) as viable pre-writing tools. A case study was conducted to ascertain and present the scientific practicability of the teaching of transferring and manipulating a context as a pre-writing strategy.

T1  - The effectiveness of concept mapping on development of critical thinking in nursing education: A systematic review and meta-analysis
AN  - 1903103947
AB  - Objectives: As an essential skill in daily clinical nursing practice, critical thinking ability has been an important objective in nursing education. Concept mapping enables nursing students connect new information to existing knowledge and integrates interdisciplinary knowledge. However, there is a lack of evidence related to critical thinking ability and concept mapping in nursing education. The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to assess the effect of concept mapping in developing critical thinking in nursing education. Design: This systematic review was reported in line with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). Data sources: A search was conducted in PubMed, Web of science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health (CINAHL) and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). Randomized controlled trials (RCT) comparing concept mapping and traditional teaching method were retrieved. Review methods: Data were collected by two reviewers according to the data extraction tables. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed by other two reviewers. The results of meta-analysis were presented using mean difference (MD). Result: Thirteen trials were summarized in the systematic review and eleven trials were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled effect size showed that, comparing with traditional methods, concept mapping could improve subjects' critical thinking ability measured by California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory ( CCTDI), California Critical Thinking Skill Test (CCTST) and Critical Thinking Scale (CTS). The subgroup analyses showed that concept mapping improved the score of all subscales. Conclusion: The result of this review indicated that concept mapping could affect the critical thinking affective dispositions and critical thinking cognitive skills. Further high quality research using uniform evaluation is required.

T1  - The impact of urban regeneration programmes on health and health-related behaviour: Evaluation of the Dutch District Approach 6.5 years from the start
AN  - 1896838861
AB  - Background 
Large-scale regeneration programmes to improve the personal conditions and living circumstances in deprived areas may affect health and the lifestyle of the residents. Previous evaluations concluded that a large-scale urban regeneration programme in the Netherlands had some positive effects within 3.5 years. The aim of the current study was to evaluate the effects at the longer run.
 Methods 
With a quasi-experimental research design we assessed changes in the prevalence of general health, mental health, physical activity, overweight, obesity, and smoking between the pre-intervention (2003–04 –mid 2008) and intervention period (mid 2008–2013–14) in 40 deprived target districts and comparably deprived control districts. We used the Difference-in-Difference (DiD) to assess programme impact. Additionally, we stratified analyses by sex and by the intensity of the regeneration programme.
 Results 
Changes in health and health related behaviours from pre-intervention to the intervention period were about equally large in the target districts as in control districts. DiD impact estimates were inconsistent and not statistically significant. Sex differences in DiD estimates were not consistent or significant. Furthermore, DiD impact estimates were not consistently larger in target districts with more intensive intervention programmes.
 Conclusion 
We found no evidence that this Dutch urban regeneration programme had an impact in the longer run on self-reported health and related behaviour at the area level.

T1  - Group concept mapping methodology: toward an epistemology of group conceptualization, complexity, and emergence
AN  - 1892127390
AB  - Group concept mapping is a participatory mixed-methods approach to social and behavioral research that integrates qualitative group processes with multivariate statistical analyses to generate, structure and represent the content of a specific topic. Group concept mapping is widely recognized as a means for capturing the complexity found in social phenomena and many claim the process and results of the method are emergent. Despite these claims however, the ontological, epistemological, and methodological foundations of group concept mapping, viewed through the phenomenological lenses of complexity and emergence, have not been fully explored. Moreover, the characteristics of group concept mapping as a shared mental model lacks a clear description. This paper argues for a more precise description of collective group mental model construction and examines emergence as a critical multi-level process for found in group concept mapping. Based on this appraisal, group concept mapping can be characterized as a discontinuous compilation model that displays configural properties congruent with this typology. The phenomenon exhibited in this type of model are the result of patterned emergence processes, and concept mapping appears to exemplify several principles associated with the conceptualization of emergence. The implications for two research activities where group concept mapping is often used, theory and measure development, are discussed.

T1  - Concept Mapping - A Graphical Tool to Enhance Learning in an Introductory Cost or Managerial Accounting Course
AN  - 2023372601
AB  - Accounting education has been criticized for its principally rule-based memorization approach to teaching accounting. This paper provides a different teaching approach, known as concept mapping that can be utilized to promote meaningful learning. Concept maps are graphical tools used to organize and represent knowledge [Novak and Can...as, 2008] and can enable students to connect what they are learning with prior knowledge. The framework underlying concept mapping is presented along with a review of studies assessing their effectiveness in teaching accounting and examples that can be used in the teaching of an introductory cost or managerial accounting course. The concepts presented in this paper can also be applied to other courses.(ProQuest: ... denotes formulae/symbols omitted.)

T1  - CONCEPT MAPPING AS A TOOL TO DEVELOP AND MEASURE STUDENTS' UNDERSTANDING IN SCIENCE
AN  - 1973331118
AB  - Concept maps measured a student's understanding of the complexity of concepts, and interrelationships. Novak and Gowin (1984) claimed that the continuous use of concept maps increased the complexity and interconnectedness of students' understanding of relationships between concepts in a particular science domain. This study has two purposes; the first one was to test this claim and examine how the repeated use of concept maps affected the complexity and interconnectedness of concepts independent of science subjects in elementary school, the second one was to compare the sensitivity of the Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997), and the Novak and Gowin (1984) grading systems for concept maps. The sample group consisted of 23 students including 14 male and 9 female students. We employed paired sample t-tests to answer the research questions, and found that the scores obtained for the fifth science unit was significantly different from the first one. Also, Novak and Gowin's (1984) scoring system was better than Ruiz-Primo et al. (1997) to evaluate complexity in students' thinking except for one of the units. We conclude that concept maps have the potential to measure change in complexity and interconnectivity of concept maps. Furthermore, repeated use of concept maps has the potential to increase the complexity and interconnectedness of student concept maps, and therefore improve their understanding of science independent of science content.

T1  - The Use of Concept Map as a Consolidation Phase Based STAD to Enhance Students’ Comprehension about Environmental Pollution
AN  - 2573862868
AB  - The purpose of this study was to improve students’ concept comprehension using concept map as a consolidation phase based STAD. This study was conducted by randomized control group pretest-posttest. Data was collected by using an instrument test to evaluate the effect of concept map as a consolidation phase based STAD on students’understanding about environmental pollution. Data was analyzed using normalized gain (n-gain) and independent t-test. The n-gain analysis shows the increased of students’s understanding about environmental pollution at experimental group arehigher than at the control group. The result of this study showed that students’ comprehension at the experimental class (0,53) higher compared to the control group (0,23). Whilst the t-test analysis shows that there is a significant effect of mapping concept as a consolidation phase based STAD towards students’ concept comprehension. It can be concluded that the implementation of mapping concept based STAD may improve the students’s understanding on science concept.

T1  - Framework provides new way of teaching biosciences
AN  - 1901707600
AB  - Western Institute of Technology in Taranaki has introduced a new, integrated way of teaching biosciences. Anecdotal evidence suggests it's helping students' understanding. Bioscience theory provides an essential foundation for nurses' knowledge of patient assessment, clinical decision-making and safe nursing care. Educators debate relevant content, effective pedagogy and curricular design in the teaching and learning of biosciences. At Western Institute of Technology (WITT), a physiologic concept map, the Oxygen Supply and Demand Framework, was chosen to support an integrated approach to biosciences education. This article describes factors influencing this pedagogical choice and the use of the framework within the undergraduate nursing curriculum.

T1  - Hindsight is 20/20: Reflections on the evolution of concept mapping
AN  - 1878714108
AB  - This paper considers the origins and development of the concept mapping methodology, a summary of its growth, and its influence in a variety of fields. From initial discussions with graduate students, through the rise of the theory-driven approach to program evaluation and the development of a theoretical framework for conceptualization methodology, the paper highlights some of the key early efforts and pilot projects that culminated in a 1989 special issue on the method in Evaluation and Program Planning that brought the method to the attention of the field of evaluation. The paper details the thinking that led to the standard version of the method (the analytic sequence, "bridging" index, and pattern matching) and the development of the software for accomplishing it. A bibliometric analysis shows that the rate of citation continues to increase, where it has grown geographically and institutionally, that the method has been used in a wide variety of disciplines and specialties, and that the literature had an influence on the field. The article concludes with a critical appraisal of some of the key aspects of the approach that warrant further development.

T1  - A CONCEPT MAPPING APPROACH TO IDENTIFY PERCEIVED FACILITATORS TO ENHANCE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF INJURY PREVENTION TRAINING IN YOUTH TEAM HANDBALL: THE I-PROTECT PROJECT
AN  - 1863569704
AB  - Background              Evidence-based injury preventive exercise programs (IPEPs) usually have limited public health impact because they are not widely implemented into regular training routines.              Objective              To identify facilitators that could help make IPEPs part of regular training routines in youth team handball.              Design              Ecological participatory approach incorporating the perspective of multiple stakeholders. This is the first phase in a series of studies within the "Implementing injury Prevention exercise ROutines in TEams and Clubs in youth Team handball (I-PROTECT)" project.              Setting              Two community team handball clubs in Sweden offering organized training for youth players.              Participants              Stakeholders from multiple levels of youth handball.              Methods              Concept Mapping (CM), a mixed-method approach for qualitative data collection and quantitative data analysis, was used. CM involves steps from generating statements from stakeholders to conceptualizing a framework for developing an implementation plan.              Results              179 stakeholders (32% players, 14% coaches, 42% caregivers, and 12% club, district and national handball administrators) participated in a brainstorming in response to the question "In order to make injury prevention training a part of our regular handball training routines I need...." . This generated 89 unique 'facilitator' statements which are currently being sorted into clusters and rated for 'importance ' and 'feasibility ' by 35 stakeholders. To date, data collection is completed for 11 of 35 stakeholders, yielding 5 clusters (stress value 0.255): "Understanding and motivation", "Education, knowledge and consistency", "Exercises and set-up", "Routines and quality assurance", and "Club policy and expert collaboration". Statements rated as both highly important and feasible indicate that developing an IPEP and an associated implementation plan in partnership with all stakeholders should be a high priority.              Conclusions              The preliminary results suggest that developing an evidence-based context-specific IPEP and an associated context-specific implementation plan in partnership with all stakeholders should be a high priority to ensure successful IPEP implementation in youth team handball.

T1  - The Use of Concept Maps as a Tool to Measure Higher Level Thinking Skills in Elementary School Science Classes
AN  - 2854154970
AB  - The need for assessing higher level thinking skills and using appropriate evaluation methods in programs for the gifted is necessary to better evaluate the effectiveness of these programs. The purpose of this study was to test the claim of Novak and Gowin (1984) that concept maps required higher level thinking skills. A related purpose of the study was to assess which type of measure, a multiple choice test or concept maps, could yield a more accurate or detailed picture of the gains in content understanding of students performing at the highest level on the instruments. A mixed method research design was used to answer the research questions. We concluded that concept maps and multiple choice tests did not measure or require the same thinking skills because of non-significant correlations between the two instruments. Three judges’ qualitative analysis also indicated that the number of items requiring higher level thinking skills on multiple choice tests was limited. Concept mapping as a whole process and the crosslinks component of concept mapping required analysis or higher level thinking skills. Also we concluded that concept mapping as a whole process has the potential to show greater gains in scores of the students than the multiple choice items, and crosslinks component of concept mapping that required analysis or higher level thinking skills. To have an alignment between the curricula of programs for gifted students and assessment methods used in these programs, the search for assessment methods requiring higher thinking skills is necessary and needs more investigation.

T1  - Learning about A level physics students’ understandings of particle physics using concept mapping
AN  - 2733172848
AB  - This paper describes a small-scale piece of research using concept mapping to elicit A level students’ understandings of particle physics. Fifty-nine year 12 (16- and 17 year-old) students from two London schools participated. The exercise took place during school physics lessons. Students were instructed how to make a concept map and were provided with 24 topic-specific key words. Students’ concept maps were analysed by identifying the knowledge propositions they represented, enumerating how many students had made each one, and by identifying errors and potential misconceptions, with reference to the specification they were studying. The only correct statement made by a majority of students in both schools was that annihilation takes place when matter and antimatter collide, although there was evidence that some students were unable to distinguish between annihilation and pair production. A high proportion of students knew of up, down and strange quarks, and that the electron is a lepton. However, some students appeared to have a misconception that everything is made of quarks. Students found it harder to classify tau particles than they did electrons and muons. Where students made incorrect links about muons and tau particles their concept maps suggested that they thought they were mesons or quarks.

AB  - Entre os movimentos do chamado novo ciclo global de lutas (2011-2013), o 15M espanhol tem se caracterizado por ter a dimensão tecnopolítica mais potente. Uma parte fundamental dessa tekné é a cartografia, revelando sua potência nos processos de auto-organização, ação distribuída e descentralizada, inclusão de atores diversos e processos de imaginação social. Como parte de uma produção de ciência do comum e enfrentando as questões fundamentais em torno da reprodução da vida na metrópole contemporânea, os mapas do 15M apresentam novas funcionalidades e avanços técnicos não praticados em semelhante escala anteriormente. Em sua inovação tecnossocial, os mapas do 15M inauguram uma prática que chamamos a arte da cartografia da multidão conectada.Alternate abstract: The new global cycle of struggles is characterized by a techno-political dimension. Revolts occur where open source knowledge, techniques, practices and strategies are learned and replicated with improvements connected by different crowds. The Spanish movement-event 15M has shown a fundamental part of this techne is cartography, revealing its enormous importance for the processes of self-organization, distributed and acesses of social imagination. As a production of a commons, this practice confronting the fundamental issues surrounding the reproduction of life in the contemporary metropolis, maps have 15M new features and technical specifications and on a scale not previously practiced: network visualization, concept maps are updated in a synergy of the street network to the network, systems and signals alerts for swarms, semantic wikis georeferenced. In his techno-social innovation, maps 15M inaugurate a practice we call the art of mapping the connected multitude.

T1  - A design-based approach to support and nurture open educational practices
AN  - 2506855736
AB  - PurposeA critical attribute of open educational practices (OEP) is the pursuit of open scholarship which comprises the release of educational resources under an open licence scheme that permits no-cost access, use, reuse, adaptation, retention and redistribution to others. The degree of openness in relation to this attribute will depend on the context and culture of the place and the people in it. When left to chance, the adoption and practice of open scholarship by educators is at best sketchy. For optimum impact, a design-based approach is essential. A central focus of such an approach will need to target educators’ belief systems and practices about their scholarship. Any such work will involve researchers collaborating with practitioners in real-life settings to improve educational practices through iterative analysis, design, development and implementation. The purpose of this paper is to report on how the development and use of such a design-based approach, implemented by the Open University of Sri Lanka, impacted the adoption and uptake of open scholarship among teachers in the Sri Lankan school system in terms of changes in their use of instructional resources, pedagogical thinking and pedagogical practices.Design/methodology/approachThe study adopted a design-based research (DBR) approach (Reeves, 2006), which involved researchers collaboratively working with practitioners in real-life settings to improve their educational practices along three aspects – instructional resource use, pedagogical perspectives and pedagogical practices. Based on the four stages of the DBR approach – analysis, solution, testing and refinement, and reflection, a professional development intervention programme was designed and implemented to support teachers on the integration of open educational resources (OER) and adoption of OEP in their teaching-learning process. Data collected throughout the process using multiple strategies such as questionnaire surveys, concept mapping, lesson plans, focus group interviews, self-reflections and “stories”, were analyzed using both qualitative and quantitative methods.FindingsBy the end of the intervention, significant changes were observed in teachers’ use of instructional resources, their pedagogical thinking and pedagogical practices. While resource usage has shifted from no or low usage of OER to reuse, revise, remix and creation of OER, the pedagogical thinking and practices of teachers moved from a content-centric and individualized patterns to more constructivist, context centric and collaborative ways. The diffusion of OEP was prominent along two dimensions – enhancements in the individual practices in innovative OER use as well as collaborative practices of sharing of resources, knowledge and good practices.Practical implicationsThe systematic and flexible methodology adopted based on the DBR approach via a framework designed as a contextualized, process oriented and a self-reflective enquiry has been very useful to support changes in OEP among practitioners over time.Originality/valueThis iterative process allowed the researchers to function as “designers”, while investigating real-life issues in collaboration with the practitioners through reflective enquiry to further refine innovative practices towards OEP. This provides valuable insights for improved design solutions for future interventions in similar contexts.

T1  - Collaborative Learning: Use Of The Jigsaw Technique In Mapping Concepts Of Physics
AN  - 2343798409
AB  - The aim of the present research was to compare two methodological tools with two groups of pre-university secondary education students (17-18 years old). The experimental group worked constructing concept maps using the jigsaw technique (experimental teaching approach, ETA) on the topic of radioactivity in five sessions of their physics course. The control group worked on the same subject in a traditional teaching method (lecture-based teaching approach, LTA). The research design was quasi-experimental, with 28 students of a school in Extremadura (Spain). The results of a pre-test and a post-test were compared for the two groups. The working hypotheses were: (a) students who work collaboratively in constructing concept maps using the jigsaw technique perform better in learning the topic of radioactivity; and (b) this method fosters a positive attitude of the students towards how the topic is taught. With respect to Hypothesis (a), the results appeared to show an improvement in learning in the experimental group, although without reaching statistical significance. Neither were there any statistically significant differences between the post-test results of the two groups. With respect to Hypothesis (b), most of the experimental group students found the method to be very encouraging; despite the insecurity they felt with something new that they were not used to. The experimental group's pre-test and post-test results were strongly correlated (r=0.707), so that the ETA can be regarded as fairly effective since the students learnt more meaningfully and with less effort.

T1  - Biology Teaching Through Self-Regulated Learning And Cognitive Structure: An Analysis Of The Effect Of Learning Strategies For Cognitive Development Via Latent Growth Model
AN  - 2343744346
AB  - This research applied the learning strategies to predict in an effect longitudinal growth of cognitive structure of students in biology. The aim of the research is to assess the effect of activating learning strategies on cognitive structures regarding biology. The research was conducted by using control group design. The sample of research was composed of 60 prospective teachers randomly assigned to the experimental and the control groups. The longitudinal data were collected every 2 weeks and 4 times in total considering the concept maps. The data were quantitatively analysed in terms of the number of concepts, connections and central concepts. Latent growth modelling (LGM) was used to analyse change in cognitive structure over time. The findings suggested that the experimental group did better in cognitive structure than the control group in terms of forming connections and central concepts. Accordingly, teaching students self-regulated learning strategies and providing support in the written material to activate the strategies influence the development of cognitive structure in a positive way in terms of the extent and the integration. Therefore, activation of the use of self-regulated learning strategies in the teaching are thought to contribute to the learning of biology.

T1  - The Application Of Concept Maps In The Teaching Of Pollination And Pollinators In Elementary School
AN  - 2343739634
AB  - Teaching biology is characterized by a great number of concepts and facts. It is very difficult to concisely represent all important concepts and facts. In order to effectively present important concepts such as pollination and pollinators, concept maps have been applied. In particular, the pedagogical experiment was applied to determine whether the concept maps are effective as teaching technology compared to the usual teaching approach without this technology. The research involved 110 elementary school students who were divided into one experimental (E) and one control (C) group. The E group covered programme content related to pollination and pollinators by applying concept maps. The C group was exposed to the same content, without these maps. It is evidenced a difference of the attained knowledge in favour of the experimental group after the introduction of the experimental factor (application of concept maps). The application of concept maps directly contributed to better learning and knowledge acquisition in teaching the biology content Pollination and Pollinators. Based upon the obtained results of this research, concept maps will be further implemented to improve teaching process and the teachers will be gradually trained for the application of this teaching technology.

T1  - INTEGRATION OF AGILE EDUCATION SOLUTIONS FOR TEACHING COMPLEX SUBJECT MATTER: AI SYSTEM DESIGN CASE STUDY
AN  - 2139457138
AB  - Historically, educating students in complex subject matter has had well known inherent challenges. Decomposing ambiguous complexities into digestible learning modules requires thoughtful topic analysis and simultaneous adherence to state, federal or national goal based learning requirements and varying agendas. Additionally, education is sometimes characterized by voices across the education continuum acknowledging significant challenges and failures. Specifically, education continues to be hampered by serial learning, complacency and regurgitation education characterized by "teaching to standardized tests" and reward systems which continue to emphasize successful memorization instead of qualitative learning. These challenges are also well-known to be intensified by economic, social and cultural issues within the home environment. Thousands of years of educational methodologies are also not changed easily. Hence, it is well known that preparing global learners for complexities and technologies far beyond the 21st century requires significant qualitative education reform. Globally, studies and analyses have continuously concluded that lack of skills are an epidemic. Teaching complex subject matter only exacerbates the problem and drives some reductionist efforts to teach more simplified concepts. Therefore, this paper attempts to address these concerns by providing some novel education options for varying education levels, leveraged from recent agile innovations. These innovations were crafted as part of imparting complex/abstract undergraduate/graduate level Artificial Intelligence engineering system design concepts combined with leveraging mature Computational Science agile development Scrum and Scrumban methodologies.

T1  - SOLO-Framed Flipped Learning Environment: "Speaking the Language of Today's Learner"
AN  - 2066610335
AB  - Based upon the evidence documented in educational research literature and the needs of today's technologically engaged students, learning environments have transitioned from being teacher-focused to student-focused. With this movement toward a student-focused learning environment, various teaching strategies (eg, webinars, videos, cases, mind mapping, and concept mapping) have been introduced into the classroom. Recently, the notion of creating a "flipped classroom" has emerged in the literature. Flipped classrooms use videobased recording technology to capture faculty lectures, which are then posted online for student access. In the flipped classroom model, the placement of lectures online is only 1 part of the learning environment. To develop students as active critical thinkers, the learning environment includes in and out-of-class experiences to engage students and maximize active learning opportunities. The purposes of this method/model presentation paper are twofold. First, this study seeks to describe how the flipped classroom can move beyond online lectures to an environment that engages physical therapy students in deeper learning of pediatric content and principles. Using the Structure of Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) model of learning as a framework, flipped learning environments can be designed to transition students to learning experiences of increasing cognitive complexity. The scaffolding approach identified in the SOLO taxonomy provides pediatric faculty a framework for designing learning activities that can aid in moving students along the 5 stages of understanding identified by SOLO (prestructural, unistructural, multistructural, relational, and extended abstract) while exploring pediatric content. Second, the authors will share quantitative and qualitative data of a small sample of physical therapist (PT) students and their perceptions regarding the impact of this SOLO-framed flipped classroom environment within a pediatric physical therapy course. Students consistently perceived that the SOLO-framed flipped learning environment increased their ability to prioritize pediatric course material, enabled a deeper understanding of the material, aided in preparation for written exams and lab practical exams, fostered their oral communications skills, helped integrate concepts associated with pediatric conditions and interventions, and promoted retention of course topics. Finally, in enhancing the application of learning, students reported increased self-confidence when working with the pediatric population, and that the flipped learning environment fostered their ability to work in a team. In general, the data supports that a SOLO-rich flipped learning environment engages PT students in questioning and guides them to a deeper awareness and insight specific to the pediatric course content. Thus, this is a teaching and learning strategy that could be employed by faculty, not only within pediatric courses, but also across the PT education curriculum.

T1  - Improving Scientific Literacy Through Reading Strategies: An Action Research Study
AN  - 2021797283
AB  - The purpose of this quantitative action research study is to examine a Scientific Reading Intervention Model (SRIM) with students enrolled in Honors Chemistry at a private high school in South Carolina. Students were given a pre-test prior to the intervention. The research took place over a six-week period in the spring of 2017. A teacher-participant worked with the researcher-participant to implement the intervention that consisted of three reading activities—pre-reading, during-reading, and post-reading. These three activities were designed to enable the low-level science readers to better comprehend their chemistry texts by activating prior knowledge with an anticipation guide, identifying key concepts through coding and connecting facts to comprehend a big picture by constructing concept maps. Students were given a post-test at the end of the unit and a simple t-test was used to analyze the pre-test and post-test data. Other data collection included semi-structured interviews with the teacher-participant and the student-participants as well as classroom observations during the implementation of the unit. Findings include reading strategies for chemistry students. An action plan includes teacher in-service for science faculty as well as implementation of a modified SRIM at the school in the fall of 2017.

T1  - Pura Vida: Teacher Experiences in a Science Education Study Abroad Course in Costa Rica
AN  - 2006913605
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore the experiences of classroom teachers who participated in a science-focused study abroad during their time as a preservice teacher and to explore how they are using their study abroad experiences in science curriculum planning and in classroom instruction. This study is guided by two research questions: 1) what are the study abroad experiences that have influenced classroom teachers; and, 2) how do classroom teachers incorporate study abroad experiences into science curriculum planning and instruction in the classroom?    Participants were two in-service science teachers from schools located in the Southwestern United States. The participants were enrolled in the course, Environmental Science and Multicultural Experience for K-8 Teachers offered through the Department of Educational Leadership, Curriculum and Instruction during their time as preservice teachers. The course included a two-week study abroad component in Costa Rica. Participants spent their mornings observing a monolingual, Spanish-speaking elementary classroom followed by a faculty-led multicultural seminar. Afternoons during the study abroad experience were dedicated to field science activities such as quantifying plant and animal biodiversity, constructing elevation profiles, determining nutrient storage in soil, and calculating river velocity. Throughout the course students participated in science-focused excursions.    A cross case study design was used to answer the two research questions guiding this dissertation study. Data collection included participant-created concept maps of the science experiences during the study abroad experience, in-depth interviews detailing the study abroad experience and classroom instruction, and participant reflective journal entries. Cross-caseanalysis was employed to explore the uniqueness of each participant’s experience and commonalities between the cases. Trustworthiness was established by utilizing multiple sources of data, member checking, documenting the process of identifying themes from findings, and peer de-briefing.    Four themes emerged via data analysis, they include: (1) experiencing science in Costa Rica, comprised of the categories of facilitated science experiences, collaborative grouping, and science stressors; (2) studying abroad in Costa Rica, containing the categories Costa Rica is your oyster, background of Costa Rica, foreground of Costa Rica, atmosphere of Costa Rica, and Costa Rican culture; (3) transferability of science experiences including the categories disposition of teaching, pedagogical knowledge, what you teach, and for whom you teach; and (4) the multicultural classroom made up of the categories Costa Rican classroom struggles, positive Costa Rican classroom climate, transferability of instructional approaches, and developing cultural competency.    Implications for study abroad decision-makers and stakeholders are included. Additionally, recommendations for future research are also described. Preservice science teachers develop their knowledge of science, confidence to teach science, and ability to instruct students in the field of science in a multicultural classroom, as a product of science-focused study abroad opportunities.

T1  - Effectiveness of concept mapping and traditional linear nursing care plans on critical thinking skills in clinical pediatric nursing course
AN  - 1994537520
AB  - Introduction: Concept map is a useful cognitive tool for enhancing a student's critical thinking (CT) by encouraging students to process information deeply for understanding. However, the evidence regarding its effectiveness on nursing students' CT is contradictory. This paper compares the effectiveness of concept mapping and traditional linear nursing care planning on students' CT. Methods: An experimental design was used to examine the CT of 60 baccalaureate students who participated in pediatric clinical nursing course in the Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences, Shahrekord, Iran in 2013. Results: Participants were randomly divided into six equal groups of each 10 student, of which three groups were the control group, and the others were the experimental group. The control group completed nine traditional linear nursing care plans, whereas experimental group completed nine concept maps during the course. Both groups showed significant improvement in overall and all subscales of the California CT skill test from pretest to posttest (P <  0.001), but t-test demonstrated that improvement in students' CT skills in the experimental group was significantly greater than in the control group after the program (P <  0.001). Conclusions: Our findings support that concept mapping can be used as a clinical teaching-learning activity to promote CT in nursing students.

T1  - Evaluation of Student Competence in Simulation following a Prebriefing Activity: A Pilot Study
AN  - 1993417654
AB  - Background: Simulation-based learning (SBL) shows promise to potentially improve clinical competence in nursing education. The efficacy of evidence-based prebriefing activities and valid and reliable systems to evaluate those strategies is a gap in the literature. Preliminary evidence shows that prebriefing can improve participant outcomes. The goal of this pilot study was to compare the outcome of clinical competence for prelicensure nursing students based on assignment to one of the following prebriefing activities: standard, careplan, or concept mapping.    Methods: This is a quasi-experimental double-blind, posttest only, comparison-group design, pilot study. The participants were from an associate degree professional nursing program. Out of a potential 30 students, 28 agreed to participate. The data collection occurred during two laboratory sessions of their medical-surgical course. The students were exposed to an assigned prebriefing activity and then engaged in a simulation scenario. Two faculty simulation evaluators (FSEs) watched the videoed performance and evaluated the students’ clinical competence using the Creighton Competency Evaluation Instrument (C-CEI). Demographic data were used to analyze the homogeneity of the groups and to determine if other factors affected clinical competence. An ANOVA was used to answer the research questions.    Results: Based on the analysis, gender, age, course grade, race and ethnicity, the groups were similar. Interrater reliability of the C-CEI overall (Kappa = 0.096 with p = 0.02) and communication (Kappa = 0.349 with p = 0.01) scores between the FSEs were significantly different. Based on their Cronbach’s alpha score (0.74) FSE Two’s ratings were used for analysis. There were no significant changes in C-CEI scores based on the students’ assigned prebriefing activity. There were significant differences between participant scores (communication 4.3(26), p = < 0.001; Clinical Judgement 2.7(26), p = 0.011; Overall 2.8(26), p = 0.01) based on their scenario.    Conclusions: Issues with the FSFs and FSEs revealed ways to improved future simulation-based research. Ensuring scenario complexity is equivalent assures comparable participant performance. Measures to enhance FSE interrater reliability must be implemented.    Limitations: The sample size was inadequate to determine statistically significant data. A lack of randomization of assignment to groups is also a limitation. An FSF provided additional cueing which could have affected some student’s C-CEI scores.

Through multimedia courseware, knowledge can be presented in a form of hierarchy concept map. In this study, we chose Biology subject as the proof of concept in our experiment. In learning the subject, students were required to imagine, visualize and memorize a lot of facts, shapes, concepts, and processes. They perceived Biology as a difficult and very unexciting subject, thus an assistant tool is required to facilitate them. In achieving that purpose, this study conducted a focus group discussion and interview, select, analyze and design a hierarchy concept map in a teaching and learning module that comprises a prototype application. The effectiveness and usability of the prototype has been evaluated. Based on the results, group A scored comparatively lower as compared to group B in the post-test with the mean score of 61.374 and 85.564 respectively, 24.19% effectiveness compared to conventional method. Respondents' perceptions and behaviors towards the visual representation of the knowledge were also positive. Therefore it can be concluded that a concept map that has been implemented in the courseware helps students to comprehend the lesson content.

T1  - Network models for mapping educational data
AN  - 1991077088
AB  - Educational mapping is the process of analyzing an educational system to identify entities, relationships and attributes. This paper proposes a network modeling approach to educational mapping. Current mapping processes in education typically represent data in forms that do not support scalable learning analytics. For example, a curriculum map is usually a table, where relationships among curricular elements are represented implicitly in the rows of the table. The proposed network modeling approach overcomes this limitation through explicit modeling of these relationships in a graph structure, which in turn unlocks the ability to perform scalable analyses on the dataset. The paper presents network models for educational use cases, with concrete examples in curriculum mapping, accreditation mapping and concept mapping. Illustrative examples demonstrate how the formal modeling approach enables visualization and learning analytics. The analysis provides insight into learning pathways, supporting design of adaptive learning systems. It also permits gap analysis of curriculum coverage, supporting student advising, student degree planning and curricular design at scales ranging from an entire institution to an individual course.

Online learning has been applied in various educational institutions, and have some positive effects on the conventional learning, especially if both learning is collaborated. Online learning helps teaching difficulties in conventional learning where learning process of individual student is hard to know in detailed by the teacher because of too many students in a single class. With online learning assisted by Learning Management System (LMS) teachers can know each student individual learning process by analyzing student log activity on the LMS which is often called by behavioral tracking. LMS used as research material is Moodle that has been applied to the Computer Science Education Department, UPI. The purpose of this research is to find learning status of each student by analyzing student's behavior while using the Moodle LMS. One of behavioral tracking model which can be used to determine the student's learning status is Monitoring Online Course with Log Data (MOCLog) model. By combining the concept map, and solution map, this model can analyze log data on Moodle LMS, and generate learning status of each individual student. Then the teacher can determine what behavioral traits are dominant, and most influential on learning with association rule data mining technique with apriori algorithms. This study provides that dominant learning status on the Computer Network course with 84.75 % students is Normal Learning Status while Frequent Access the Course to be an activity that greatly affect the student's learning status in the Moodle LMS course with 48 students.

In language learning contexts, reading comprehension is an important learning activity. In EFL reading comprehension learning, one of the frequent styles of reading is the sentence-by-sentence style, in which learners can understand the text as separate sentences only, not as a whole structure. This study focus on the structural understanding of test and map making process from the viewpoints of paragraph. The assumption in this study is that map making in KB mapping does not follow sentence order but focus sets of meanings formed by paragraphs. This study investigates the relation between map making process in KB and SB mapping and paragraph structure of text.

T1  - Knowledge-Based Biomedical Word Sense Disambiguation with Neural Concept Embeddings

Biomedical word sense disambiguation (WSD) is an important intermediate task in many natural language processing applications such as named entity recognition, syntactic parsing, and relation extraction. In this paper, we employ knowledge-based approaches that also exploit recent advances in neural word/concept embeddings to improve over the state-of-the-art in biomedical WSD using the MSH WSD dataset as the test set. Our methods involve weak supervision - we do not use any hand-labeled examples for WSD to build our prediction models; however, we employ an existing well known named entity recognition and concept mapping program, MetaMap, to obtain our concept vectors. Over the MSH WSD dataset, our linear time (in terms of numbers of senses and words in the test instance) method achieves an accuracy of 92.24% which is an absolute 3% improvement over the best known results obtained via unsupervised or knowledge-based means. A more expensive approach that we developed relies on a nearest neighbor framework and achieves an accuracy of 94.34%, essentially cutting the error rate in half. Employing dense vector representations learned from unlabeled free text has been shown to benefit many language processing tasks recently and our efforts show that biomedical WSD is no exception to this trend. For a complex and rapidly evolving domain such as biomedicine, building labeled datasets for larger sets of ambiguous terms may be impractical. Here, we show that weak supervision that leverages recent advances in representation learning can rival supervised approaches in biomedical WSD. However, external knowledge bases (here sense inventories) play a key role in the improvements achieved.

T1  - A Comparative Study of Hawaii Middle School Science Student Academic Achievement
AN  - 1985701892
AB  - The problem was middle-grade students with specific learning disabilities (SWDs) in reading comprehension perform less well than their peers on standardized assessments. The purpose of this quantitative comparative study was to examine the effect of electronic concept maps on reading comprehension of eighth grade students with SWD reading comprehension in a Hawaii middle school Grade 8 science class on the island of Oahu. The target population consisted of Grade 8 science students for school year 2015–2016. The sampling method was a purposeful sampling with a final sample size of 338 grade 8 science students. De-identified archival records of grade 8 Hawaii standardized science test scores were analyzed using a one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) in SPSS. The finding for hypothesis 1 indicated a significant difference in student achievement between SWDs and SWODs as measured by Hawaii State Assessment (HSA) in science scores (p < 0.05), and for hypothesis 2, a significant difference in instructional modality for SWDs who used concept maps and does who did not as measured by the Hawaii State Assessment in science (p < 0.05). The implications of the findings (a) SWDs performed less well in science achievement than their peers and consequently, and (b) SWODs appeared to remember greater degrees of science knowledge, and answered more questions correctly than SWDs as a result of reading comprehension. Recommendations for practice were for educational leadership and noted: (a) teachers should practice using concept maps with SWDs as a specific reading strategy to support reading comprehension in science classes, (b) involve a strong focus on vocabulary building and concept building during concept map construction because the construction of concept maps sometimes requires frontloading of vocabulary, and (c) model for teachers how concept maps are created and to explain their educational purpose as a tool for learning. Recommendations for future research were to conduct (a) a quantitative comparative study between groups for academic achievement of subtests mean scores of SWDs and SWODs in physical science, earth science, and space science, and (b) a quantitative correlation study to examine relationships and predictive values for academic achievement of SWDs and concept map integration on standardized science assessments.

T1  - Learning reference-enriched approach towards large scale active ontology alignment and integration

With the increasing number of ontologies being designed to represent and manage knowledge in all sorts of sectors, ontology alignment and integration become more and more important in aggregating intelligent efforts on homogenous and heterogeneous data. From the computational perspective, it is challenging due to the ubiquitous existence of diverse classifications of same data. In this paper, we propose an active ontology integration and alignment system, which plugs in expandable learning reference context pool. In the reference context pool, we have integrated WordNet, MeSH, and external curated mapping sources (ICD9 to SNOMEDCT) with an extension to injecting UMLS. The active ontology integration and alignment system takes account of not only subsumption tree but also directed acyclic graph underlying ontologies. It allows 1) finding exact one-to-one matching terms of pairwise ontologies, 2) finding inexact one-to-one term mappings, where two terms have at least a concept in common on basis of the lexical context, and 3) finding one-to-many concept mappings, where one concept can be lexically mapped to the combination of multiple exclusive concepts.

T1  - Challenges and Changes: Developing Teachers’ and Initial Teacher Education Students’ Understandings of the Nature of Science
AN  - 1966993014
AB  - Teachers need an understanding of the nature of science (NOS) to enable them to incorporate NOS into their teaching of science. The current study examines the usefulness of a strategy for challenging or changing teachers’ understandings of NOS. The teachers who participated in this study were 10 initial teacher education chemistry students and six experienced teachers from secondary and primary schools who were introduced to an explicit and reflective activity, a dramatic reading about a historical scientific development. Concept maps were used before and after the activity to assess teachers’ knowledge of NOS. The participants also took part in a focus group interview to establish whether they perceived the activity as useful in developing their own understanding of NOS. Initial analysis led us to ask another group, comprising seven initial teacher education chemistry students, to take part in a modified study. These participants not only completed the same tasks as the previous participants but also completed a written reflection commenting on whether the activity and focus group discussion enhanced their understanding of NOS. Both Lederman et al.’s (Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 39(6), 497–521, 2002) concepts of NOS and notions of “naive” and “informed” understandings of NOS and Hay’s (Studies in Higher Education, 32(1), 39–57, 2007) notions of “surface” and “deep” learning were used as frameworks to examine the participants’ specific understandings of NOS and the depth of their learning. The ways in which participants’ understandings of NOS were broadened or changed by taking part in the dramatic reading are presented. The impact of the data-gathering tools on the participants’ professional learning is also discussed.

Advance organizer strategies based on cognitive theories have been found to have an impact on learning in the early studies. However, recent studies have found inconclusive results when type and format of the advance organizers were taken into account. This study investigated the impact of different formats of advance organizers (graphic with text explanation, voice narration, and concept map) on learners understanding of science concepts. A total of 136 high school students participated in this study. A factorial design was utilized for the experiment using format of advance organizers as the independent variable while learners achievement on retention and transfer test regarding the learning content as the dependent variables. The findings showed that using graphical advance organizers, especially the concept map, worked effectively in achieving high school students understanding of the learning content. The results showed that using concept map was likely to conceptually anchored viewers attention on key elements of reading content. When designing instructional materials, it is advised to take the advantage of graphical organizers to achieve understanding of abstract science concepts. Implications and suggestions for effective instructional design and for future studies are provided in this paper.

In recent years, the research of adaptive learning path has drawn a lot of attentions, which organizes the learning resources in accordance with the learner's attributes. As a result, it is quite necessary to find an efficient implementation approach for generating the adaptive learning path. In this paper, we first create a learner-centered concept map by graph theory. Then learning object (LO) is applied as an organization model for learning resource and we apply the immune algorithm (IA) into its selection to generate the optimal learning path. The simulation results show that the proposed approach is effective for adaptive learning path generation.

T1  - Challenges and weaknesses in the use of concept maps as a learning strategy in undergraduate health programs
AN  - 1953953796
AB  - This paper considers the analysis of concept maps utilized as a learning tool in disciplines dealing with immunological responses in two undergraduate Health programs. In total, 48 concept maps were assessed regarding their propositions and structure. The clarity of the propositions was analyzed by using the Propositional Clarity Table and they were classified as adequate propositions (AP) and inadequate propositions (IP). In 48 concept maps, 648 propositions were analyzed in order to determine semantic clarity and conceptual mistakes. Assessments revealed that 69 % of the propositions were classified as adequate and 31 % as inadequate. All the maps analyzed were categorized as showing a network structure. However, when correlating the connections established among the several types of response by the immune system, it was found that despite being structured as a network, only 31.2 % of the concept maps indicated conceptual relationships between the modes of immune response. 27% of the concept maps were made with a high rate of proficiency. Upon the results of our analysis, we realized that there is still a long way in developing the mapping strategy. For us, this low percentage is related to the way undergraduates assimilate the mapping processes. This is a challenge which also reveals limits and weaknesses that may be addressed in future studies. It was noted that results bring into focus that the undergraduates’ learning of concepts associated with the bases of the immunological responses occurred in a meaningful way.

T1  - Communication Patterns & Team Performance: A Working Model
AN  - 1951123204
AB  - Communication patterns of content and flow between team members is a complicated maze of dynamics that could unlock researchers' understanding of team performance. This research analyzes two teams based on their extreme team performance via communication patterns defined by specific content to assess flow between individuals within the team. The methodology executed was a three-part process: (1) classifying utterances into various actions, (2) indexing the utterances by content and flow, and (3) analyzing these communication patterns using augmented fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs). The two teams selected exceeded the first standard deviation of normalized team performance from three years of encoded video data. From the video data, ten key communication concepts were identified. The strengths of the relationship among those concepts were estimated and compared between the high and the low team performance. The results showed that the strength of "providing information" concept was significantly different between the high and low team performance. This research empirically demonstrates that different communication patterns can assist in understanding overall team performance using fuzzy logic.

T1  - Understanding the factors affecting the attraction and retention of health professionals in rural and remote areas: a mixed-method study in Niger
AN  - 1935078172
AB  - Background 
The critical shortage of human resources in health is a critical public health problem affecting most low- and middle-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to the shortage of health professionals, attracting and retaining them in rural areas is a challenge. The objective of the study was to understand the factors that influence the attraction and retention of health professionals working in rural areas in Niger. 
Methods 
A mixed-method study was conducted in Tillabery region, Niger. A conceptual framework was used that included five dimensions. Three data collection methods were employed: in-depth interviews, documentary analysis, and concept mapping. In-depth interviews were conducted with three main actor groups: policy-makers and Ministry of Health officials (n = 15), health professionals (n = 102), and local health managers (n = 46). Concept mapping was conducted with midwifery students (n = 29). Multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis were performed to analyse the data from the concept mapping method. A content analysis was conducted for the qualitative data. 
Results 
The results of the study showed that the local environment, which includes living conditions (no electricity, lack of availability of schools), social factors (isolation, national and local insecurity), working conditions (workload), the lack of financial compensation, and individual factors (marital status, gender), influences the attraction and retention of health professionals to work in rural areas. Human resources policies do not adequately take into account the factors influencing the retention of rural health professionals. 
Conclusion 
Intersectoral policies are needed to improve living conditions and public services in rural areas. The government should also take into account the feminization of the medical profession and the social and cultural norms related to marital status and population mobility when formulating human resources management policies.

T1  - Factors That Influence Physicians to Assume Leadership Roles: A Focus on Clinical Integration
AN  - 1927182094
AB  - The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (PPACA) drastically altered the healthcare industry in the United States. Along with multiple other directives, the PPACA mandated that physicians and hospitals work together in strategies known as clinical integration. For effective clinical integration to be achieved, interdependence among physicians and hospitals is required to provide the highest quality outcomes for patients at the best possible value. To this end, healthcare leaders have identified that the key to establishing successful clinical integration is the presence and commitment of physician leaders (Penlington & Marshall, 2016).    This study explores factors that influenced a sample of physician leaders to assume leadership roles in clinical integration. The qualitative phenomenology methodology was selected to study the experiences of physician leaders through their own perspectives. The theoretical framework is guided by the concept of meta-leadership, with a focus on the dimensions of leadership in context and trust.    Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 purposefully selected physicians holding leadership roles within hospitals, hospital-employed medical groups, and/or physician-hospital associations. Data collected from these in-depth interviews related to four research questions: (1) How do physicians make the decision to transition into leadership roles within health systems?; (2) What leadership skills are required for physician leaders within health systems?; (3) To what extent does healthcare reform impact physician leadership within health systems?; and (4) What are the perceived benefits and drawbacks of being a physician leader within health systems?    Based on the four research questions, a concept map was developed to code themes and patterns in participant responses. The overall key findings of this study include: (a) encouragement by mentors or friends, (b) career progression into leadership, (c) desire to impact change, (d) lack of prior leadership education or training, (e) the importance of change management, (f) acceptance and management of healthcare reform, (g) need for physician leaders in healthcare, (h) enjoyment in leadership responsibilities, (i) the importance of having influence and a voice in decision making, (j) giving up time devoted to other causes, (k) frustrations with the amount of time needed to impact change, (l) difficulties in work/life balance, and (m) difficulties in leadership/clinical balance.    Recommendations from this empirical investigation provide guidance to health systems seeking physician leaders. Understanding the leadership choices of current physician leaders is instrumental to inspiring, recruiting, and training additional physician leaders to meet clinical integration needs. If healthcare leaders can begin to understand the reason current physicians have accepted leadership roles, they may be better equipped to recruit additional physician leaders.

AB  - Article info Article Type: Original Research Article History: Received: 19 Dec. 2016 Accepted: 2 Feb. 2017 epublished: 29 June 2017 Keywords: Concept mapping Content analysis Education Learning Nursing student Abstract Background: Nursing education provides opportunities for students to create positive changes in a clinical setting. [...]the use of modern teaching approaches such as concept mapping (CM) in nursing can be useful. Introduction Today, organizations opt to seek specific changes in their health care professionals, theories of changes which per se require applying creative strategies to the educational process.1 In the meantime, nursing education provides opportunities for students to create positive changes in a clinical setting.2 Thus, the use of modern teaching approaches such as concept mapping (CM) in nursing can be useful. New material will be learned when it detects and travels into its association area in the learner's cognitive structure, and starts building connections as a new loop in association with previously-stored loops of concepts.3 In this regard, and for a successful development, the nursing education curriculum could change its course and present a paradigm shift from the traditional model towards one of making students active in discovering knowledge and learning goals. Students who learn content in a rote fashion often find education a difficult and unsuccessful experience.4 The reason behind this change in curriculum focus lies in the fact that nursing as a career has suffered from major setbacks in recent years, and nurses, forced to provide care to patients with a variety of known and unknown diseases,...

T1  - Learning About Semi Conductors for Teaching—the Role Played by Content Knowledge in Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) Development
AN  - 1913146022
AB  - This study focuses on how teachers learn to teach a new topic and the role played by their developing content knowledge as they teach. The paper is based on seven high school science teachers’ studies on the teaching of semiconductors, at the time a new topic in the curriculum. Analysis of artefacts such as teacher concept maps, video recordings of lessons, journals and other classroom-based evidence shows how the extent and type of teachers’ content knowledge informed their choice of teaching approaches and how their learning of content took place alongside the development of teaching strategies. The development of content knowledge was combined with increased understanding of how to teach the topic in almost all cases. Evidence of development of teachers’ PCK was found in their increased ability to design teaching strategies, and their use of representations and suitable assessment tasks for their lessons. Some specific common teaching strategies were identified across the teachers. These strategies could add to the canon of teachers’ topic - specific professional knowledge for semiconductors. The study provides increased understanding of how teachers simultaneously master content and its teaching and how mediated self-reflection is a fruitful approach for assisting teachers to learn to teach a new topic.

The post-test is used as a measuring instrument and the post-test scores are statistically analysed. The results of Levene's test and t-test reveal that mean of post-test scores of the experimental and control groups are statistically significant. This confirms the Alternate Hypothesis that students who studied using concept maps (experimental group) attained higher learning compared to the students who did not use the concept maps (control group). The learner achievement score reveals that 17.7 % higher learning has been attained by experimental group compared with control group. Questionnaires were used to know the students perceptions on the use of concept maps. The results of questionnaire analysis showed that students find concept maps are useful in teaching and learning. Further details of this study are discussed in the article.

Formative assessment is a new method of educational assessment. In contrast to summative assessment, formative assessment constitutes a relatively modern assessment method, whose goal is to reveal the student's weaknesses to the teacher and help the teacher to design accordingly appropriate practices to aid the students improve their performance. Formative assessment application can be done periodically and can be categorized to short-term, when executed between classes, and to long-term. Several innovative assessment techniques for assessment in engineering education have been proposed during the recent years, such as the use of concept maps, assessing student's Learning Outcomes, five step outcome driven assessment and more, both quantitative and qualitative assessment methods. A smart system especially designed and implemented for the particular needs of engineering education and STEM education in general, is presented on this paper. Such a system is currently under development and tested for the purposes of mathematical education in primary and secondary education. If the right adjustments and modifications are made, it can work for STEM education as well.

T1  - DEVELOPING PRE-SERVICE SCIENCE TEACHERS TPACK CONFIDENCE THROUGH WEB BASED COMICS
AN  - 1901707630
AB  - The Technology Pedagogy and Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework used in the preservice teacher training program requires new approaches to the effective integration of technology in science education, highlighting the intersection of the three main domains previously mentioned (technology, pedagogy and science content knowledge) in the training of prospective teachers. To develop the pre-service teacher's confidence in using TPACK we have chosen training activities built on web based comics and mind/concept maps as our pedagogical methods. Web based comics consist of fixed sequences of images and text created and viewed through dedicated online applications. In science education, comics represent a creative alternative to present and explain a concept, phenomenon and/or a situation. Visual methods such as concept cartoons or concept maps can be used for learning new concepts or systemizing information. We have opted for these methods since communicating scientific concepts and knowledge through visual representations and using web 2.0 applications and gadgets are features which characterize the current generation of students.In this paper we describe the way in which pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the Teacher Training Program at the West University of Timisoara between the years 2014 and 2016, have acquired and evaluated TPACK while participating in the design, management and analysis of learning activities based on visual representations developed for compulsory education. Our study reveals that they consider the integration of web based comics in their teaching activities to be beneficial for presenting, explaining and assessing the concepts and phenomena taught in class, as well as for identifying and correcting misconceptions. Furthermore, our study shows that the future physics teachers have developed TPACK since an efficient integration of comics and mind maps assumes a more profound understanding of the relationship between technology, pedagogical knowledge and the scientific content taught in class.

T1  - Supporting Students’ Learning and Socioscientific Reasoning About Climate Change—the Effect of Computer-Based Concept Mapping Scaffolds
AN  - 1880792247
AB  - Climate change is one of the most challenging problems facing today’s global society (e.g., IPCC 2013). While climate change is a widely covered topic in the media, and abundant information is made available through the internet, the causes and consequences of climate change in its full complexity are difficult for individuals, especially non-scientists, to grasp. Science education is a field which can play a crucial role in fostering meaningful education of students to become climate literate citizens (e.g., NOAA 2009; Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005). If students are, at some point, to participate in societal discussions about the sustainable development of our planet, their learning with respect to such issues needs to be supported. This includes the ability to think critically, to cope with complex scientific evidence, which is often subject to ongoing inquiry, and to reach informed decisions on the basis of factual information as well as values-based considerations. The study presented in this paper focused on efforts to advance students in (1) their conceptual understanding about climate change and (2) their socioscientific reasoning and decision making regarding socioscientific issues in general. Although there is evidence that “knowledge” does not guarantee pro-environmental behavior (e.g. Schreiner et al., 41, 3–50, 2005; Skamp et al., 97(2), 191–217, 2013), conceptual, interdisciplinary understanding of climate change is an important prerequisite to change individuals’ attitudes towards climate change and thus to eventually foster climate literate citizens (e.g., Clark et al. 2013). In order to foster conceptual understanding and socioscientific reasoning, a computer-based learning environment with an embedded concept mapping tool was utilized to support senior high school students’ learning about climate change and possible solution strategies. The evaluation of the effect of different concept mapping scaffolds focused on the quality of student-generated concept maps, as well as on students’ test performance with respect to conceptual knowledge as well as socioscientific reasoning and socioscientific decision making.

T1  - Improving students' critical thinking skills through Remap NHT in biology classroom
AN  - 1955993262
AB  - Previous studies in Malang, Indonesia showed that there were the failure biology learning caused by not only the low students' prior knowledge, but also biology learning model has not improved the students' critical thinking skills yet, which affected the low of cognitive learning outcomes. The learning model is required to improve students' critical thinking skills. Learning model that considered able to solve this problem is a model that combines reading, constructing concept maps, and the implementation cooperative learning type Numbered Heads Together (Remap NHT) in the classroom. This study was quasi experimental research that compared the effect of Remap NHT learning model and traditional learning in biology classroom to improve critical thinking skills at Xth grade students of senior school in Malang, Indonesia. The results showed that the implementation of Remap NHT during biology classroom showed the effect on students' critical thinking skills.

T1  - Cognitive structures of university students about environmental education, climate change and consumption concepts
AN  - 1955990713
AB  - The purpose of this study was to determine cognitive structures and the retention of knowledge about environmental education, climate change and consumption concepts. The field of Environmental Education is increasingly including both climate change and consumption in the context of sustainability. Thus, this research is investigating the construction of cognitive structures using all three concepts. The study group consisted of 52 students (28 females and 24 males) attending the University of Minnesota Duluth, USA. A word association instrument was used for data collection. In order to evaluate the study results, the responses given about the key concepts were examined in detail. A frequency table was constructed to show which words or concepts best represented each key concept included in the instrument. Based on our findings, a frequency table and associated concept maps were generated to indicate how cognitive structures were formed about the three concepts. The findings showed that respondents generated many ideas related to the key concepts presented in the instrument. However, respondents did not appear to see the broad environmental concepts as a network of related ideas. Implications for using the word association test in the classroom are discussed.

T1  - Automated content analysis: addressing the big literature challenge in ecology and evolution
AN  - 2374306880
AB  - The exponential growth of scientific literature – which we call the ‘big literature’ phenomenon – has created great challenges in literature comprehension and synthesis. The traditional manual literature synthesis processes are often unable to take advantage of big literature due to human limitations in time and cognition, creating the need for new literature synthesis methods to address this challenge.In this paper, we discuss a highly useful literature synthesis approach, automated content analysis (ACA), which has not yet been widely adopted in the fields of ecology and evolutionary biology. ACA is a suite of machine learning tools for the qualitative and quantitative synthesis of big literature commonly used in the social sciences and in medical research.Our goal is to introduce ecologists and evolutionary biologists to ACA and illustrate its capacity to synthesize overwhelming volumes of literature. First, we provide a brief history of the ACA method and summarize the fundamental process of ACA. Next, we present two ACA studies to illustrate the utility and versatility of ACA in synthesizing ecological and evolutionary literature. Finally, we discuss how to maximize the utility and contributions of ACA, as well as potential research directions that may help to advance the use of ACA in future ecological and evolutionary research.Unlike manual methods of literature synthesis, ACA is able to process high volumes of literature at substantially shorter time spans, while helping to mitigate human biases. The overall efficiency and versatility of this method allow for a broad range of applications for literature review and synthesis, including both exploratory reviews and systematic reviews aiming to address more targeted research questions. By allowing for more extensive and comprehensive reviews of big literature, ACA has the potential to fill an important methodological gap and therefore contribute to the advancement of ecological and evolutionary research.

T1  - Student Self-Efficacy of Learning Using Illness Scripts
AN  - 1918321212
AB  - Student self-efficacy of learning after using illness scripts is described as an innovative strategy to teach clinical reasoning in an online pathophysiology and pharmacology course for RN to BSN students. Using illness scripts, students cluster relevant clinical features together to develop a plan of care while developing pattern recognition and expertise. A demographic survey, the student self-efficacy scale, and open-ended questions were administered to a convenience sample of students enrolled in the course. A high self-efficacy of learning was found over all student self-efficacy scale items (M = 8.94, SD = 0.24).

T1  - Investigating the Impact of NGSS-Aligned Professional Development on PreK-3 Teachers' Science Content Knowledge and Pedagogy
AN  - 1842827493
AB  - This pilot study investigates the impact of a 2-week professional development Summer Institute on PK-3 teachers' knowledge and practices. This Summer Institute is a component of [program], a large-scale early-childhood science project that aims to transform PK-3 science teaching. The mixed-methods study examined concept maps, lesson plans, and classroom observations to measure possible changes in PK-3 teachers' science content knowledge and classroom practice from 11 teachers who attended the 2014 Summer Institute. Analysis of the concept maps demonstrated statistically significant growth in teachers' science content knowledge. Analysis of teachers' lesson plans demonstrated that the teachers could design high quality science inquiry lessons aligned to the Next Generation Science Standards following the professional development. Finally, examination of teachers' pre- and post-Summer Institute videotaped inquiry lessons showed evidence that teachers were incorporating new inquiry practices into their teaching, especially regarding classroom discourse. Our results suggest that an immersive inquiry experience is effective at beginning a shift towards reform-aligned science and engineering instruction but that early elementary educators require additional support for full mastery.

T1  - Understanding the validity of data: a knowledge-based network underlying research expertise in scientific disciplines
AN  - 1837167158
AB  - This article considers what might be taught to meet a widely held curriculum aim of students being able to understand research in a discipline. Expertise, which may appear as a 'chain of practice', is widely held to be underpinned by networks of understanding. Scientific research expertise is considered from this perspective. Within scientific disciplines, how research is conducted to solve different problems varies with concomitant effects on the validity of the data and the strengths of the claims made. Despite this variation, the overarching concepts of validity and reliability and the underpinning and interrelated network of more specific 'concepts of evidence' are applicable to understanding a wide range of research designs and the uncertainties in the resultant data and claims. These constituent ideas, which inter alia have been validated as relevant to professional and academic expertise, form an integrated knowledge base about evidence which can be visualised on a concept map. The network of ideas underpinning research expertise across scientific disciplines is outlined. Research from explicitly teaching the concepts of evidence is reported, and the implications for teaching and learning in science-based disciplines in HE are considered.

T1  - Geographic space: an ancient story retold
AN  - 1820545365
AB  - Location, as the fundamental concept in geography, is important for all sciences that study objects and behaviours in geo-space. Although other disciplines are capable of formulating definitions of location and geo-space, they nevertheless look up to geography to devise and articulate a comprehensive and practical concept of 'everything geographic'. Essentially quantitative in its concern, geography has yet to quantify the concept of geo-space in order to both fulfil the ancient Greeks' vision of geography and advance it for use in other disciplines. We revisit the epistemological and broader philosophical principles of geo-space and apply these principles to identifying and quantifying the key aspects of geo-space: topos,choros and geos. Rather than following the narrow numerical tradition of quantitative geography and GIS, we adopt broader philosophical perspective of Kant on Quantity (Unity, Multiplicity, Totality) and argue that the 'natural' extension of the classical approach to geo-space necessitates its further philosophical quantification. We show that the ancient Greeks' concept maps into locations (topos), spatial relations (choros) and topology (geos). Extending the concept further necessitates the use of the language of set theory for defining basic concepts. We show that the result is both tractable and quantifiable, connects classical with modern and completes the definition of geo-space on all three levels of Quantity (unity, multiplicity, totality). We demonstrate the tractability of thus defined concept by reinterpreting Tobler's First Law of geography in theoretically sound terms. We show that a refined, modern concept of geo-space is both philosophically fulfilling and practically useful - some properties of geo-space are too important to be ignored or distorted.

T1  - Group concept mapping for evaluation and development in nursing education
AN  - 2879789589
AB  - The value of course evaluations has been debated since they frequently fail to capture the complexity of education and learning. Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a participant-centred mixed-method was explored as a tool for evaluation and development in nursing education and to better understand students' learning experiences, using data from a GCM-based evaluation of a research training assignment integrating clinical practice and research data collection within a Swedish university nursing program. Student nurses (n = 47) participated in a one-day GCM exercise. Focus group brainstorming regarding experiences from the assignment that the students considered important and instructive yielded 98 statements that were individually sorted based on their student-perceived relationships, and rated regarding their importance/instructiveness and need for development. Quantitative analysis of sort data produced a 2-dimensional map representing their conceptual relationships, and eight conceptual areas. Average cluster ratings were plotted relative to each other and provided a decision aid for development and planning by identifying areas (i.e., “Research methodology”, “Patients' perspectives”, and “Interviewer role”) considered highly important/instructive and in high need for development. These experiences illustrate the use and potential of GCM as an interactive participant-centred approach to evaluation, planning and development in nursing and other higher health science educations.

T1  - The Effects of Integrating Computer-based Concept Mapping for Physics Learning in Junior High School
AN  - 2786524683
AB  - Background:
It generally is accepted that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on learning. But literatures show the use of concept mapping is not benefit all learners. The present study explored the effects of incorporating computer-based concept mapping in physics instruction.
Material and methods:
A total of 61 9th-grade students participated in this study. By using a quasi-experimental research approach, 31 students were assigned to a group that received computer-based concept mapping assisting instruction (CBCM), and 30 students were assigned to a constructive activities group that received “Work, Power, and Energy Curriculum” instruction without concept mapping assistance (NCM). Both groups participated for eight weeks, with four sessions per week and 45 minutes per session. A pre test-post test control group design was employed.
Results:
The findings revealed that the CBCM group students scored higher than the NCM group students on the cognition understanding and higher order thinking subtests. No significant differences were found in the conception memorization subtest. In the retention test, the students in the CBCM group outperformed the students in the NCM group on all subtests.
Conclusions:
The results of the current study revealed that concept mapping activities effectively promote higher order thinking abilities and knowledge retention.

T1  - Group concept mapping for evaluation and development in nursing education
AN  - 1822749052
AB  - The value of course evaluations has been debated since they frequently fail to capture the complexity of education and learning. Group Concept Mapping (GCM), a participant-centred mixed-method was explored as a tool for evaluation and development in nursing education and to better understand students' learning experiences, using data from a GCM-based evaluation of a research training assignment integrating clinical practice and research data collection within a Swedish university nursing program. Student nurses (n = 47) participated in a one-day GCM exercise. Focus group brainstorming regarding experiences from the assignment that the students considered important and instructive yielded 98 statements that were individually sorted based on their student-perceived relationships, and rated regarding their importance/instructiveness and need for development. Quantitative analysis of sort data produced a 2-dimensional map representing their conceptual relationships, and eight conceptual areas. Average cluster ratings were plotted relative to each other and provided a decision aid for development and planning by identifying areas (i.e., "Research methodology", "Patients' perspectives", and "Interviewer role") considered highly important/instructive and in high need for development. These experiences illustrate the use and potential of GCM as an interactive participant-centred approach to evaluation, planning and development in nursing and other higher health science educations.

T1  - Impact of a concept map teaching approach on nursing students' critical thinking skills
AN  - 1815619723
AB  - Nurses confront complex problems and decisions that require critical thinking in order to identify patient needs and implement best practices. An active strategy for teaching students the skills to think critically is the concept map. This study explores the development of critical thinking among nursing students in a required pathophysiology and pharmacology course during the first year of a Bachelor of Science in Nursing in response to concept mapping as an interventional strategy, using the Health Education Systems, Incorporated critical thinking test. A two-group experimental study with a pretest and posttest design was used. Participants were randomly divided into a control group (n = 42) taught by traditional didactic lecturing alone, and an intervention group (n = 41), taught by traditional didactic lecturing with concept mapping. Students in the concept mapping group performed much better on the Health Education Systems, Incorporated than students in the control group. It is recommended that deans, program directors, and nursing faculties evaluate their curricula to integrate concept map teaching strategies in courses in order to develop critical thinking abilities in their students.

T1  - Designing automated guidance for concept diagrams in inquiry instruction
AN  - 1813612711
AB  - Advances in automated scoring technologies have the potential to support student learning during inquiry instruction by providing timely and adaptive guidance on individual students' responses. To identify which forms of automated guidance can be beneficial for inquiry learning, we compared reflective guidance to directive guidance for student-generated concept diagrams in web-based inquiry instruction. Eleven intact classes were randomly assigned to either a reflective guidance or a directive guidance condition. After creating a concept diagram showing energy flow in life science during the inquiry instruction, the directive group was told specific ways to improve their diagram, while the reflective group was told to revisit a relevant visualization step to locate useful information. The results from the concept diagrams, as well as individual tests, show that both forms of automated guidance helped students add target energy concepts, but reflective guidance was significantly more effective than directive guidance in improving students' coherent understanding of how energy flows in life science. Analyses of log data revealed that the reflective group was more likely to revisit the visualization step as suggested in the guidance, which significantly enhanced student learning. Detailed analyses suggest that revisiting relevant materials to find useful information challenged students to identify gaps in their understanding and distinguish among multiple ideas. This study shows the value of designing reflective automated guidance for helping students engage in evidence-gathering practices and enhance their understanding of scientific concepts. The findings suggest promising directions for the design of automated adaptive guidance to support complex science learning. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 53:1003-1035, 2016

T1  - Effects of the Integrated Online Advance Organizer Teaching Materials on Students’ Science Achievement and Attitude
AN  - 2259588325
AB  - This two-group quasi-experimental study investigated the effects of the Online Advance Organizer Concept Teaching Material (ONACOM) integrated with inquiry teaching and expository teaching methods. Grade 7 students’ posttest performances on the light unit achievement and light unit attitude tests controlled for gender, previous semester science grade, and pretest scores were analyzed. No significant treatment effects were found between the inquiry and expository approaches. However, both groups demonstrated significant pretest–posttest gains in achievement and attitude. Independent from the method used, ONACOM was judged effective in both groups as students demonstrated increased achievement and attitude scores. ONACOM has a social and semantic network-aided infrastructure that can be adapted to both methods to increase students’ achievement and improve their attitude.

T1  - The articulation of integration of clinical and basic sciences in concept maps: differences between experienced and resident groups
AN  - 2259113117
AB  - To determine the content of integrated curricula, clinical concepts and the underlying basic science concepts need to be made explicit. Preconstructed concept maps are recommended for this purpose. They are mainly constructed by experts. However, concept maps constructed by residents are hypothesized to be less complex, to reveal more tacit basic science concepts and these basic science concepts are expected to be used for the organization of the maps. These hypotheses are derived from studies about knowledge development of individuals. However, integrated curricula require a high degree of cooperation between clinicians and basic scientists. This study examined whether there are consistent variations regarding the articulation of integration when groups of experienced clinicians and basic scientists and groups of residents and basic scientists-in-training construct concept maps. Seven groups of three clinicians and basic scientists on experienced level and seven such groups on resident level constructed concept maps illuminating clinical problems. They were guided by instructions that focused them on articulation of integration. The concept maps were analysed by features that described integration. Descriptive statistics showed consistent variations between the two expertise levels. The concept maps of the resident groups exceeded those of the experienced groups in articulated integration. First, they used significantly more links between clinical and basic science concepts. Second, these links connected basic science concepts with a greater variety of clinical concepts than the experienced groups. Third, although residents did not use significantly more basic science concepts, they used them significantly more frequent to organize the clinical concepts. The conclusion was drawn that not all hypotheses could be confirmed and that the resident concept maps were more elaborate than expected. This article discusses the implications for the role that residents and basic scientists-in-training might play in the construction of preconstructed concept maps and the development of integrated curricula.

T1  - The impact of procedural and epistemological knowledge on conceptual understanding: the case of density and floating-sinking phenomena
AN  - 1811906014
AB  - The aim of the present study was twofold. First, we aimed to replicate the findings of previous studies which had showed a substantial improvement on procedural and epistemological knowledge after direct instruction and their maintenance in time. Second, we aimed to examine the dynamic relationships of the procedural (control of variables strategy) and epistemological (nature of models) knowledge and the conceptual understanding of interrelated phenomena (floating-sinking) and subordinate abstract concepts (density) that have been developed to explain these phenomena across the learning process. A five-unit teaching learning sequence was organized and implemented in three 5th grade (N = 53) science classes. Participants answered at three time points--before, immediately following and 7 months after the implementation--in a questionnaire involving eight questions concerning the four abovementioned teaching and learning content areas. The collected data was used to test, with Path analysis, the validity of the theoretically designed model that depicted the causal relationships between the four areas. The inquiry-based activities were successful in bringing students' ideas closer to the scientific knowledge. In addition, the model fitted in well with our data. So, the instruction of procedural and epistemological knowledge was crucial in the conceptual understanding of density in the frame of floating-sinking interpretation. In addition, understanding of the concept of density as a property of materials immediately following the implementation contributes significantly to students' interpretations of floating-sinking phenomena even 7 months later.

T1  - An Augmented-Reality-Based Concept Map to Support Mobile Learning for Science
AN  - 1802566783
AB  - Computer hardware and mobile devices have developed rapidly in recent years, and augmented reality (AR) technology has been increasingly applied in mobile learning. Although instructional AR applications have yielded satisfactory results and prompted students' curiosity and interest, a number of problems remain. The crucial topic for AR applications is the lack of appropriate instructional scaffolds to help students organize the content to be learned. Moreover, a lack of appropriate instructional activities and scaffolds often results in student confusion and frustration. Therefore, we integrated AR with concept maps to form a concept-mapped AR (CMAR) scaffold. Subsequently, whether CMAR improves learning outcomes, motivation, and attitude in mobile learning activities was determined. An empirical study was conducted on 71 fifth-grade elementary students in Southern Taiwan. The students were divided into CMAR and AR system groups. The results showed that students in the CMAR group performed significantly better than those in the AR group. The student interview results also showed that the CMAR system helped students organize what they wanted to learn.

T1  - Effects of a Question Prompt-based Concept Mapping Approach on Students?Learning Achievements, Attitudes and 5C Competences in Project-based Computer Course Activities
AN  - 1814441164
AB  - Concept mapping has been widely used in various fields to facilitate students’ organization of knowledge. Previous studies have, however, pointed out that it is difficult for students to construct concept maps from the abundant searched data without appropriate scaffolding. Thus, researchers have suggested that students could produce high quality concept maps when they construct them with appropriate guidance. Accordingly, this study proposes a question prompt-based concept mapping approach, which was conducted in a computer course with a duration of 14 weeks on the research issue of global warming. There were 176 senior high school students from four classes who participated in the experiment. The study adopted a quasi-experimental design for the investigation of the effectiveness of the proposed approach; two classes were randomly assigned to be the experimental group, learning with the question prompt-based concept mapping approach, while the other two groups were the control group, who used the conventional concept mapping approach. The results indicated that the students in the experimental group had better performance than those in the control group in terms of their learning achievement, 5C competences, and learning attitudes. In addition, the results also showed that students with a reflective style had better learning achievement than those with an active style. Thus, it is worth investigating, for such an issue, how to propose more effective learning models for diverse student learning styles in the future. This can provide useful guidance for educators, practitioners and researchers in the areas of science education and computer-assisted education.

T1  - Using Concept Maps for Assessment and Improvement of a Multi-Section Introduction to Engineering Course
AN  - 2317811392
AB  - The authors, professors in civil engineering, teach multiple sections of an introduction to engineering course. The course has general student learning outcomes that apply to multiple areas of engineering (e.g., civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemical engineering, etc.) that were developed by consensus of the engineering departments at the institution. In addition to these general student learning outcomes, discipline-specific student learning outcomes are incorporated into individual sections of the course. These outcomes are developed by the individual faculty member teaching the section and are related to his/her disciplinary expertise. The sections that serve as the foundation for the work presented in this paper have student learning outcomes associated with civil engineering and specifically with urban infrastructure and geotechnical engineering.
Because of the general nature of most introduction to engineering courses, comparison of assessment outcomes across different course sections can be difficult, and that difficulty can hinder productive discussions across disciplines and the development of recommendations for course improvements. The authors have used a simple concept map assignment, given on the first and last day of each course, to evaluate student learning outcomes, and as a basis for analysis of multiple sections of the course within civil engineering and the development of recommendations for course improvements in that area. The work presented in this paper is anticipated to serve as the foundation for a future project assessing sections of the course across multiple engineering areas.

T1  - Work in Progress: Evaluation of the Concept Mapping in a Student-Centered Biomaterials Course
AN  - 2317811093
AB  - Concept mapping is a reflective technique used for teaching practices in science and engineering classrooms. It requires students to create an intellectual framework that shows major ideas and emphasizes their interrelatedness. Concept maps enable students to internalize the information they have learned, identify the key concepts, and document the relationships to one another by drawing physical connections between them. Concept maps are used in a junior-level, student-centered Biomaterials course to assess student understanding and highlight topics needing more attention. This study will investigate the newly adopted concept mapping session in terms of achievement, attitude, and persistence. Furthermore, the quality of concept map will be compared to achievement levels.
Briefly, the student-centered class entails a Muddiest Point exercise followed by the concept mapping session and a mini-lecture enhanced with Clicker questions. During the concept mapping session, students work in groups created by CATME which groups based on desired team attributes. For each homework assignment, each group creates concept maps about the related content, using a free software package, CMap. Students then evaluate their group members using CATME’s peer evaluation capability.
Assessment of concept mapping in the Biomaterials course will focus on three areas: achievement, attitude, and persistence. The achievement will be measured by the academic performance (final grades). Moreover, we will compare final grades from semesters with and without the concept mapping activity. Additionally, student concept maps will be scored according to their propositions (“Is the relationship valid?”), hierarchy (“Are more general concepts above and less general below?”), cross links (“How many connections are drawn?”), and examples (“Are there examples provided?”). It is predicted a high score on a students’ concept map correlates to high achievement. Attitude will be tracked with a custom survey based on the previously validated survey “Student Value of Muddiest Points Survey” by Carberry, et al. based on motivation theory. More specifically, students will provide feedback on the interest, utility, and cost associated with concept maps. Each survey item ranges from 1—strongly disagree to 4 – strongly agree. Scores associated with concept maps will be compared to another student-centered strategy used in the course – Muddiest Points. Lastly, persistence will be measured as those students enrolled on the 21st day of class who take the final exam.
This work will evaluate various facets of evidence-based concept mapping in a junior-level Biomaterials course. As demonstrated by others, by using concept maps as a learning strategy, instructors are giving students the opportunity to improve their critical thinking skills, to visualize the complex relationships between concepts, and to personalize their learning. Additionally, proper use of concept maps will lead to more efficient use of classroom time by more clearly understanding topics students need to be clarified.

T1  - Re-designing Design: A Technology-enhanced Graduate-level Biomedical Design Course
AN  - 2317804298
AB  - Introduction. Biomedical engineering (BME) is an evolving discipline that involves collaboration among engineers, physicians, scientists and entrepreneurs, in academia and industry to provide interdisciplinary solutions to biomedical problems. During biomedical design, a range of strategies can be used to identify a problem and to generate and evaluate solutions. In the Department of BME, an established program exists for teaching biomedical design to undergraduates which culminates in our highly successful ‘Senior Design’ course. However, no specified design experience exists for our BME Master's students. Design courses are traditionally taught utilizing a textbook, lectures, and a team design project, with often limited time for interactions between teams and instructors in the classroom. Therefore, we saw a valuable opportunity to not only extend BME design education to our graduate students but also to redefine and enhance the approach to teaching BME design. Therefore, our primary objective was to develop an immersive graduate-level course in biomedical engineering design, utilizing an innovative technology-enhanced pedagogical approach.
Our Unique Approach. A graduate-level course in BME design was developed that incorporated a hybrid learning approach with core video lectures outside the classroom and collaborative in-class learning experiences, such as group exercises, case studies, coaching sessions, interactions with outside visiting industrial and entrepreneurial experts, and hands-on prototyping. In addition to the use of video technology, additional technological tools including project management and brainstorming/concept mapping tools were utilized to enhance team interactions, creativity, and organization. Assessment of course dynamics and effectiveness was achieved through the development and use of Critical Incident Questionnaires throughout the semester and Course Feedback Surveys at the midpoint and end of the semester.
Results. This technology-enhanced pedagogical approach allowed for students to have enhanced interaction with course materials, instructors, faculty, other students, and outside visiting industrial and entrepreneurial experts. Design concepts were introduced prior to class using short video lectures, allowing students to spend the majority of class time applying these concepts. Additional in-class time allowed for the course instructor, assistants, and visiting industry experts to provide individual support to student project teams by providing recommendations and guidance during coaching sessions. Lastly, more time was made available for significant hands-on prototyping and proof of concept testing in the laboratory. In addition to the use of video technology, the project management tool allowed for effortless progress tracking and centralization of team materials, which encouraged group collaboration and allowed students to gain real-world experience with project management software. The use of brainstorming and concept mapping tools allowed for enhanced creativity during the brainstorming process and also encouraged group collaboration.
Conclusion. This newly developed graduate-level design course provided students with an immersive real-world training in biomedical design. The technology-enhanced pedagogical approach allowed for students to have enhanced interaction with course materials and instructors, improving their learning experience and increasing their overall satisfaction with the course.

T1  - Using Concept Maps to Illustrate the Evolution of Key Concepts: Student Learning Experience in a Foundational Undergraduate Engineering Course
AN  - 2317799809
AB  - As a graphical tool for knowledge organization, representation, and elicitation, concept mapping has received growing attention and application in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines as an effective instructional strategy to improve student conceptual understanding. This paper reports how the concept mapping approach was employed in a foundational undergraduate engineering dynamics course. In this course, students (rather than the instructor) developed their concept maps to illustrate the evolution of key concepts in engineering dynamics. Data were collected from students who took an engineering dynamics course in recent two semesters: Semester I when concept mapping was not employed and Semester II when concept mapping was employed. The results show that as compared to Semester I, students developed better conceptual understanding in Semester II. Four representative examples of concept maps generated by students in Semester II are presented in this paper. A representative set of student comments are also presented, which demonstrate how the concept mapping approach helped students develop better conceptual understanding.

T1  - A Flipped Solid Mechanics Course Designed Based on the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive (ICAP) Framework
AN  - 2317798626
AB  - A Flipped Solid Mechanics Course Designed Based-on the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive (ICAP) Framework
A Solid Mechanics course has been completely redesigned based on the Interactive, Constructive, Active, and Passive (ICAP) framework by Chi et al.[1]. According to Chi et al.[1], engagement behaviors can be categorized into one of the four modes: passive, active, constructive, and interactive; and out of these four modes, students’ learning increases when they are more engaged in course materials, from passive to active to constructive to interactive. Examples of passive learning include listening to a lecture; reading a book; and observing a video; etc.[2]. While active learning means students are actively manipulating course materials, for example, they write summaries of the text; take verbatim notes; copy solutions to example problems; pause, play, fast-forward, or rewind a tape; etc.[2]. Characteristics of constructive activities include new ideas being generated from outputs such as a concept map, a reflection report, self-generated notes, an explanation, etc. that go beyond what was presented[1]. Finally, being interactive means that students are interacting with others and each person involved needs to be constructive. Examples of interactive learning activities include, two students arguing and defending a position; two students asking and answering comprehension questions; etc.[1]. While the phrase “active learning” has been used a lot when one talks about a flipped classroom, there are different levels of “active learning” activities and a course that is designed to focus on more constructive and interactive learning activities will more likely enhance students’ learning.
To promote constructive and interactive learning, a new flipped course structure as well as various materials were designed and developed for a solid mechanics course and the new flipped model was implemented during the spring 2015 semester to a section of 93 mechanical and aerospace engineering students. The paper will describe examples of activities designed and implemented around each of the four learning modes, with a focus on constructive and interactive learning. Challenges to design and implement a course like this will also be discussed. The class taught in spring 2014 using the traditional lecture method will be used as the control group and the one taught in spring 2015 by the same instructor using the flipped model will serve as the experimental group. End-of-semester course evaluation survey data will be analyzed and compared for both groups both quantitatively and qualitatively. Students’ performances on three in-class preliminary exams will also be compared for both groups. Results suggest that the flipped model, designed using the ICAP framework was favored by students for various reasons, e.g., it better stimulates student thinking; it enhances a deeper understanding of the course materials; it made learning easier; it reduced total amount of time needed to study for this course; it helped to build a relationship among the peers; etc. It was also suggested that the flipped model may have helped students who would otherwise fail the class to successfully complete the class.

T1  - First-Year Students' Conceptions of Sustainability as Revealed through Concept Maps
AN  - 2317798269
AB  - The term sustainability is over-used and often misused in society. Further, sustainability and sustainable engineering are complex topics. This research explored how first year engineering students define these complex ideas, and the impacts of two different instructional methods on their ideas. Sustainability knowledge was evaluated using concept maps. Students’ initial ideas about sustainability were explored based on concept maps that individual students generated in-class. This was followed by two different instruction methods. Civil and architectural engineering students in a two-credit first year introduction to engineering course learned about sustainable engineering rating systems in a two-week module; they repeated the concept map as part of the graded homework assignment on sustainability. This course was compared to a 1-credit seminar-style introductory sustainability course that focused on the social sciences aspects of sustainability over the whole semester via a series of readings and in-class discussions; these seminar students repeated the concept map as part of their final exam. The concept maps were scored by counting the number of individual concepts, cross-links, and highest hierarchy; these metrics were also combined into a total weighted score. Beyond these basic quantitative measures that apply generically to any concept map, the distribution of sustainability concepts across the three pillars of environmental, social, and economic issues was also determined. The in-class “pre” concept maps showed significant variability in students’ sustainability knowledge, ranging from 3 to 34 concepts, 0 to 16 cross-links, hierarchical depth of 1 to 7, and total scores of 9 to 192. Students in both the civil & architectural engineering class (n=72) and the sustainability seminar course (n=44) had improved sustainability concept maps after instruction. Categorical scoring found that environmental aspects comprised the highest percentage of the concepts on both the pre- and post- instruction concept maps. However, the post-instruction concept maps in both courses had significantly higher percentages of both social and economic aspects compared to the pre- concept maps. This indicates that students achieved both a richer and a more balanced understanding of sustainability. There were somewhat larger increases in the number of social and economic concepts on the concept maps of students in the sustainability seminar course as compared to the civil & architectural engineering course. This difference was expected based on the focus and greater depth of sustainability instruction in the seminar course. The concept maps seemed useful to judge the success of different instructional methods, and seemed an appropriate assessment of students’ sustainability knowledge.

T1  - Deepening Understanding in Qualitative Inquiry
AN  - 1806967361
AB  - In this paper the authors describe how the use of multiple methods of qualitative data collection over a two-year period, including interviews, concept maps and journals, and the analysis of data through visual inquiry, categorizing (constant comparison thematic analysis), and connecting (narrative analysis) provided a more comprehensive understanding of the process of evolution in college teachers' perspectives on teaching and learning within a professional development program than would have emerged with only a single method. Concept maps provided an initial visual footprint of teachers' emerging perspectives. Categorization revealed four major patterns across teachers' perspectives. Connecting the data through narrative summaries exposed a contextualized rendition of aspects of individual teachers' perspectives. Each of these three approaches offers a unique lens into qualitative data analysis, and when used together, they clarify important aspects of the phenomenon under investigation.

T1  - Design of a Dynamic Undergraduate Green Chemistry Course
AN  - 1784556201
AB  - The green chemistry course taught at Westminster College (PA) incorporates nontraditional teaching techniques and texts to educate future chemists about the importance of using green chemistry principles. The course is designed to introduce green chemistry concepts and demonstrate their inherent necessity by discussing historical missteps by the chemical industry, and future design possibilities. Students learn to apply green chemistry principles through case studies and journal article activities, while connecting all of these resources and experiences with concept maps. The final course project requires students to create their own green chemistry educational materials. This nontraditional approach to teaching chemistry provides an opportunity for students to learn in dynamic ways and to be creative in their contributions to green chemistry.

T1  - The State-of-the-Science on Somatosensory Function and Its Impact on Daily Life in Adults and Older Adults, and Following Stroke: Occupation, Participation and Health
AN  - 2420549042
AB  - The aim was to identify and synthesize research evidence about how adults and older adults process somatosensory information in daily activities, and the interventions available to regain somatosensory function following stroke. We developed two interacting concept maps to address the research questions. The scoping review was conducted from 2005 to 2015 across Web of Science, AMED, CINAHL, Embase, Medline, and PsychInfo databases. Search terms included somatosensory, perception, performance, participation, older adult, stroke, intervention, discrimination, learning, and neuroplasticity. Contributions from 103 articles for Concept 1 and 14 articles for Concept 2 are reported. Measures of somatosensory processing, performance, and participation used are identified. Interventions available to treat somatosensory loss are summarized in relation to approach, outcome measures, and theory/mechanisms underlying. A gap exists in the current understanding of how somatosensory function affects the daily lives of adults. A multidisciplinary approach that includes performance and participation outcomes is recommended to advance the field.

T1  - The Effects of Concept Map-Oriented Gesture-Based Teaching System on Learners’ Learning Performance and Cognitive Load in Earth Science Course
AN  - 2786532589
AB  - Gesture-based learning have particularities, because learners interact in the learning process through the actual way, just like they interact in the nondigital world. It also can support kinesthetic pedagogical practices to benefit learners with strong bodily-kinesthetic intelligence. But without proper assistance or guidance, learners’ learning performance are usually disappointing. To cope with this problem, the aim of this paper proposed a concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system in earth science course. There were 90 participants in the experiments designed with the three teaching strategies (concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching system, conventional gesture-based teaching system, and traditional e-book teaching materials). The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials also improve the learning performance of the students in earth science course than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. Learners’ cognitive load was also measured and showed that the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy had lower cognitive load than conventional gesture-based teaching strategy. There was no significant difference in learning performance and cognitive load between the concept map-oriented gesture-based teaching strategy and traditional e-book teaching materials.

T1  - Identifying the critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole in secondary science classrooms
AN  - 1773420890
AB  - The amount of substance and its unit the mole is a basic concept in chemistry. However, previous research has shown that teaching and learning the concept are challenging tasks for both teachers and students. The purpose of this study was to pinpoint the problems which emerge in the teaching and learning process, and provide integrated suggestions for classroom instruction. By means of videotaping and interviews, the case studies explored how the mole is presented and conceptualized in two secondary classrooms in two different countries, Australia and Taiwan. Data analysis was based on a concept map and focused on how two key ideas were presented in the lessons and perceived by the students: (1) the definition of the mole, and (2) the concept of molar mass. The findings show that during the lessons on the mole, most of the time was spent on solving stoichiometric problems. Conceptually, the number aspect of the mole, that is, Avogadro's number, was emphasized; the concept of molar mass was introduced without meaningfully connecting it to the concept of relative atomic/molecular mass. Although the students were able to solve relevant problems, they could not coherently explain the relations among the concepts. Two critical components for a conceptual understanding of the mole emerged: (1) the number aspect of the mole needs to be justified by its mass aspect, and (2) the connection between molar mass and relative atomic/molecular mass needs to be explicitly explained. The two components provide one explanation for students' algorithmic learning and their confusion in learning about the mole, and serve as concrete suggestions for improving classroom instruction. The study once again manifested the significance of teaching for conceptual understanding in science education. It also exemplifies how a concept map of a specific scientific concept can also be a useful analytical tool in educational research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 53: 181-214, 2016.

T1  - Randomized comparison between objective-based lectures and outcome-based concept mapping for teaching neurological care to nursing students
AN  - 1771599446
AB  - Pre-registration programs have been found to insufficiently prepare nurses for working in the neurosciences specialism. Effective approaches to neurology education are important, not only to enhance motivation to learn, but also for learners to develop basic competence in handling patients with neurological problems. To demonstrate that outcome-based course design using concept mapping would bring about significant differences in the nursing students' competency, cognitive load, and learning satisfaction with the neurological care course. A two-group pretest and post-test experimental study was administered. Two of the four clusters of participants were randomly assigned to the experimental group for experiencing an outcome-based course design using concept mapping, and the rest were designated the control group to be given objective-based lectures only. The Competency Inventory of Nursing Students, Cognitive Load Scale of Neurological Nursing, and Learning Satisfaction Scale of Neurological Nursing were used in this study for the students to rate their own performance. In addition, The Concept Map Scoring Scale was used in the experimental group for examining students' concept mapping ability. Significant increases of mean nursing competency scores in both groups from pre-test to post-test were found. There was no statistically significant difference in mean nursing competency score between the experimental group and the control groups at post-test. The mean cognitive load score of the experimental group was lower than the control group at post-test. The mean learning satisfaction scores of the experimental group were higher than the control group. This article provides that outcome-based concept mapping as educational method could encourage a group of nursing students to take a bio-psycho-social approach to medicine, which might ultimately result in better nursing care quality.

T1  - Understanding nurses' decision-making when managing weaning from mechanical ventilation: a study of novice and experienced critical care nurses in Scotland and Greece
AN  - 1765367974
AB  - Aim and objectives              To examine how nurses collect and use cues from respiratory assessment to inform their decisions as they wean patients from ventilatory support.              Background              Prompt and accurate identification of the patient's ability to sustain reduction of ventilatory support has the potential to increase the likelihood of successful weaning. Nurses' information processing during the weaning from mechanical ventilation has not been well-described.              Design              A descriptive ethnographic study exploring critical care nurses' decision-making processes when weaning mechanically ventilated patients from ventilatory support in the real setting.              Methods              Novice and expert Scottish and Greek nurses from two tertiary intensive care units were observed in real practice of weaning mechanical ventilation and were invited to participate in reflective interviews near the end of their shift. Data were analysed thematically using concept maps based on information processing theory. Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained.              Results              Scottish and Greek critical care nurses acquired patient-centred objective physiological and subjective information from respiratory assessment and previous knowledge of the patient, which they clustered around seven concepts descriptive of the patient's ability to wean. Less experienced nurses required more encounters of cues to attain the concepts with certainty. Subjective criteria were intuitively derived from previous knowledge of patients' responses to changes of ventilatory support. All nurses used focusing decision-making strategies to select and group cues in order to categorise information with certainty and reduce the mental strain of the decision task.              Conclusions              Nurses used patient-centred information to make a judgment about the patients' ability to wean. Decision-making strategies that involve categorisation of patient-centred information can be taught in bespoke educational programmes for mechanical ventilation and weaning.              Relevance to clinical practice              Advanced clinical reasoning skills and accurate detection of cues in respiratory assessment by critical care nurses will ensure optimum patient management in weaning mechanical ventilation.

T1  - Scaffolding students' use of learner-generated content in a technology-enhanced inquiry learning environment
AN  - 1758335217
AB  - Having students inspect and use each other's work is a promising way to advance inquiry-based science learning. Research has nevertheless shown that additional guidance is needed for students to take full advantage of the work produced by their peers. The present study investigated whether scaffolding through an integrated support tool could bring about the desired effect. This tool was embedded in an online inquiry learning environment and outlined the steps in searching for information in peer-created concept maps. It also contained specific directions to assess the quality of the retrieved information. The effectiveness of this search guidance tool was investigated during an inquiry-based science project. Main results indicated that high school students who were supported by the tool (n = 19) developed a more differentiated and interconnected conceptual understanding than students who did not receive this scaffold (n = 23). However, the search guidance tool also seemed to put additional demands on students' self-regulatory abilities, and might therefore require some practice or regulatory support to reach its full potential.

T1  - Theoretical foundation and literature review of the study of concept maps using eye tracking methodology
AN  - 2437753773
AB  - In this paper, we will be carrying out an in-depth analysis of a series of investigations involving concept maps used in eye tracking methodology. First, the background to this kind of research is analyzed: on the one hand we will focus on generic scientific literature about those concept maps with theoretical foundations in the psychology of learning, and second the literature of eye tracking in teaching and learning will be reviewed. Finally, we will center our attention on the way in which the literature for these two areas overlaps. A total of 15 published works on concept maps using eye tracking were located and subsequently the quality of these papers, their visibility, topics, and results were analyzed. The findings show there are very few published works on this subject, all originated from dispersed sources which proved difficult to locate, despite the fact that eye tracking methodology lends itself perfectly to the study of concept maps. We predict that in coming years there will be many more publications in this field.

TT  - Theoretical foundation and literature review of the study of concept maps using eye tracking methodology
AN  - 2437753483
AB  - En este artículo se presentan los resultados de una revisión bibliográfica sobre las investigaciones publicadas hasta la fecha sobre mapas conceptuales aplicando la metodología del seguimiento de la mirada. Se estudian los antecedentes de este tipo de trabajos: por un lado la producción científica genérica sobre mapas conceptuales con bases teóricas en la psicología del aprendizaje y por otro lado la metodología del seguimiento de la mirada aplicada a la investigación sobre la enseñanza y el aprendizaje. Finalmente se concreta en la intersección de ambos tipos de trabajos y se reseñan 15 publicaciones sobre mapas conceptuales usando el seguimiento de la mirada. Se analiza la calidad de estos trabajos, su visibilidad, los temas tratados y los resultados obtenidos. Los conclusiones son que hay pocas publicaciones, dispersas y con poca visibilidad y que el seguimiento de la mirada se aplica de forma poco eficiente. A pesar de estas conclusiones, se constata que la metodología del seguimiento de la mirada se adecua muy bien al estudio de los mapas conceptuales y se pronostica que en los próximos años habrán muchos más trabajos en este campo.Alternate abstract: In this paper, we will be carrying out an in-depth analysis of a series of investigations involving concept maps used in eye tracking methodology.

T1  - Framework Categorization Of Pre-Service Physics Teachers’ Conceptions Of Vector-Kinematics
AN  - 2343763687
AB  - Current research in physics shows that pre-service teachers have poor content knowledge in vector-kinematics. This study describes the types of categories of conceptions pre-service teachers display in vector-kinematics. Descriptive and interpretive qualitative research was conducted in which the data were concept maps from 28 third-year pre-service teacher volunteers in a physics module at a university. Participants were supported in the use of CmapTools to draw their concept maps of vector-kinematics. This study was guided by Ausubel’s theory of meaningful learning which relates individuals’ new knowledge to relevant concepts they already possess. Framework thematic analysis revealed seven knowledge categories with differing extensiveness: two of conceptual knowledge (hierarchical and relational), three of alternative conceptions (naïve, lateral, ontological) and two of mixed conceptions and loose ideas. The findings showed a lack of higher level conceptual understanding of vector-kinematics. The study has implications for the teaching and learning of vector-kinematics.

T1  - Prospective Chemistry Teachers’ Abilities Of Creating Concept Maps: Hydrocarbons Example
AN  - 2343749534
AB  - Concept maps are effective tools for showing the relations between the concepts and they can be used to make clear the relations between the abstract concepts such as hydrocarbons topic. The aim of this research is to determine the abilities of prospective chemistry teachers’ (PCTs) creating concept maps about hydrocarbons. In this research , case study was used and the study was carried out in a university in North Coast of Turkey with 25 PCTs (aged 20-27). PCTs were taught how to create concept maps, types of concept maps such as hierarchical, non- hierarchical and chain or spoke concept maps through example concept maps. In this research context, PCTs were given a text about hydrocarbons and they were supposed to prepare their own concept maps about hydrocarbons. Their concept maps were evaluated according to the reference concept map which was prepared by the researchers. At the end of the research, it is seen that PCTs had difficulty in constructing concept maps. According to the conclusions drawn from the research, some suggestions were offered.

T1  - Mind-Bodies, Interdependent Opposites and Knots: A Phenomenological Inquiry into the Child-Teacher Relationship in Upper Primary School
AN  - 1896027361
AB  - This study is a qualitative, phenomenological inquiry into teachers’ and children’s ‘lived experiences’ of the child-teacher relationship in an Irish upper primary school context. It highlights the current need to re-focus our attention on the child-teacher relationship which Biesta (2004) argues is the 'location' of education. An overview of the literature on relational pedagogy is provided which connects the child-teacher relationship to broader theoretical debates including Heidegger's (1962) concept of Mitsein and Buber's I- Thou relation (1937). Hermeneutic phenomenology describes the overarching methodology following van Manen’s (1990) ‘lived experience’ approach.The study was conducted in a large, suburban, primary school with designated disadvantaged status. Before data generation commenced, a Children’s Research Advisory Group was established in the school following Lundy, McEvoy, and Byrne (2011). The function of this group was to advise about conducting research with children. Research participants included three teachers and five children from each of those teachers’ classes. Data generation featured the use of protocol writing and conversational interviews following van Manen (1990, 2014) and the use of embodied, drama methods which were unique to this study but inspired by the work of Norris (2000) and guided by O’Sullivan (2011). Data was also generated using visual methods drawing on the work of Mitchell (2011), Tinkler (2015) and Chappell and Craft (2011). In line with the phenomenological approach adopted, data was interpreted in what Gadamer (1989) describes as a circular manner. This involves attending to ‘parts’ whilst keeping in mind the ‘whole’ picture.This study identified three overarching thematic findings which find resonance with the fields of relational pedagogy and embodied teaching and learning as well as new insights at the point where these two areas overlap. These include how teachers and children relate to one another as ‘whole, embodied feeling beings’; the idea that there is a tension between ‘closeness’ and ‘distance’ in the child teacher relationship and that there is a need for both ‘structure’ and ‘freedom’ to feature in that relationship. Further, this study found that the child-teacher relationship is experienced as ‘knotted’ with social and contextual relationships. These findings are discussed in light of the concepts of ‘connectedness’ and ‘emergence’, features of complexity theory. This study provides new insights into how teachers and children experience their relationships with one another, thereby extending the body of knowledge on the child-teacher relationship.

T1  - A framework for collaborative knowledge management: Using distributed mentoring
AN  - 1895150984
AB  - Knowledge management consists of four key processes, generation, distribution, storage, and application. Today, with the simultaneous growth of World Wide Web and usage of computing devices, including smart phones, tablets, and laptops, knowledge is also being generated and modified by knowledge-contributors, labeled mentors. Output of this process makes its way into various sources, such as wikis, blogs, and Question- and-answer websites. New storage technologies are continuously being evolved in order to efficiently handle huge volumes of this kind of unstructured data. However, distribution of knowledge to knowledge-consumers, labeled mentees, has not been evolved to keep up with the exponential growth in generation and storage. Since all four phases of knowledge management are relatively interdependent, sub-optimal growth in only some of the phases causes an imbalance to the knowledge management effort as a whole. This results in problems like disconnected learning, inadequate knowledge summary, repetition of efforts, and limited recommendations. To address this limitation in knowledge management, we introduced a framework for collaborative knowledge management using distributed mentoring where individual knowledge of all participants is collected into a shared knowledge repository and systematically transformed into visual community knowledge by collaborative efforts of both mentors and mentees. We apply the framework in educational, organizational, and online settings. Architectural design to implement the framework along with the results derived from case study of an online community are presented.

T1  - Learning Science by Constructing Models: Can Dragoon Increase Learning without Increasing the Time Required?
AN  - 1880867720
AB  - A common hypothesis is that students will more deeply understand dynamic systems and other complex phenomena if they construct computational models of them. Attempts to demonstrate the advantages of model construction have been stymied by the long time required for students to acquire skill in model construction. In order to make model construction a feasible vehicle for science instruction, the Dragoon system combined three simplifications: (1) a simple notation for models of dynamic systems, (2) a step-based tutoring system, and (3) problems that described the model to be constructed as well as the system represented by the model. In order to test whether these simplifications reduced the time for learning how to construct models while preserving the benefits of model construction over baseline instruction, three classroom studies were conducted. All studies were experiments, in that they compared classes using Dragoon to classes learning the same material without Dragoon. However, as classroom studies, they could not tightly control all sources of variation. The first study produced null results, but it compared learning across just one class period. The second study in 4 high school science classes showed that instruction based on Dragoon cost only one extra class period (about 50 min) out of 4 class periods and was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. A third study in 3 more high school science classes, where 2 Dragoon classes and 1 non-Dragoon class met for the same number of class periods, showed that Dragoon was more effective than the same content taught without Dragoon. The effect sizes were moderately large on both an open response test (d = 1.00) and a concept mapping task (d = 0.49). Thus, it appears that our efforts have simplified model construction to the point that it can be used in science instruction with no additional class time needed, and yet it still seems to be more effective than the same instruction done without model construction.

T1  - The Influence of Team Psychological Safety on Team Knowledge Creation: A Comparative Study between Thai, French and American Engineering Teams
AN  - 1880560482
AB  - This research evaluates the impact of team psychological safety on the creation of team knowledge. When teams engage in team learning and display the associated learning behaviors (seeking feedback, asking for help, innovative behavior, boundary spanning and speaking up about concerns or mistakes), their interactions contribute to improved task performance. Very little research evaluates if these behaviors, rooted in the level of psychological safety within the team, also result in the creation of knowledge at the team level, either related to the task or related to the team itself. The proposed model is developed and evaluated through a mixed method research design around a team problem solving experiment. Concept mapping and questionnaires are used as elicitation methods for the taskand team-related team mental models respectively and enhanced with the results of one-onone and team interviews. Evaluations at different intervals evaluate the changes over time of the knowledge created in the team. The model is evaluated in teams from three different cultural backgrounds (USA, France and Thailand), to assess if culture influences team psychological safety, and to verify its moderating effect on team knowledge creation.    The research findings confirm the validity of the proposed research model for teams from the USA and France, in particular the hypotheses that both team psychological safety and team learning impact the creation of team-related and task-related team knowledge. The model is not confirmed for teams from Thailand and the research finds that team psychological safety is influenced by cultural components. A number of possible explanations for the case of teams from Thailand are proposed.    This research has theoretical and practical benefits. The research is unique in that team learning behaviors are evaluated through the codification of team interactions, rather than from team members’ own assessments. It also measures the impact of team learning not just on the task, but evaluates team knowledge in a dynamic way by analyzing the team- and task-related mental models over a period of time. From a practical point of view, the research demonstrates that developing team psychological safety and creating team learning opportunities brings benefits in the development of the team’s knowledge even if they may not impact the current task. The research also highlights that this may not be generalizable across all cultures.    This research was done with engineering teams from \a single organization. Future research could validate the model in other teams in multiple organizations. For the teams from Thailand in this research, both the proposed research model and the original model on which it was based are not validated. This finding should be confirmed or further evaluated with other teams in Thailand or other cultures in Asia.

T1  - Conceptual understanding of threshold concepts of electrical phenomena: Mental models of senior undergraduates in electrical engineering
AN  - 1875556309
AB  - Every field of study has a set of domain-specific concepts that anyone who desires to work in that field must know and understand. Most students who pursue university degrees in engineering trust that their education is designed to provide them with this knowledge. But does it? In electrical engineering (EE), conceptual understanding of electrical phenomena has rarely been addressed. Even though the presumed goal of instructors and students alike is to learn the concepts of electrical phenomena well enough to be able to use the concepts to design useful things, it is difficult to determine whether this goal is being achieved. The purpose of this study was to develop reasonable representations of the mental models used by senior EE students as they thought about and worked with electrical phenomena. Focusing on students’ mental models of threshold concepts in electrical phenomena can thus increase knowledge of students’ conceptual understanding, which can contribute to systematic research into pedagogical and assessment methods in this area of study, which forms one of the most basic and fundamental areas of knowledge needed by EE students.   Thus, the research question addressed by this study was:   What do senior EE students’ mental models of the fundamental electrical phenomena of voltage, current, and the relationship between them look like?    The theory of mental models claims that everyone organizes their understanding of the way the world works by constructing models in the mind by which they both explain phenomena that they observe, and make predictions about what is likely to occur in a given situation.   To observe the students’ mental models in operation, semi-structured interviews were used to engage the participants in a conversation concerning their knowledge and experience in applying electrical ideas. Using discourse analysis, a representation of each student’s mental model was created, consisting of a concept map and a short narrative. While the models were all different, analysis of them as a group led to the emergence of five dominant themes, or ways of thinking.   The findings of this study have implications for the course of study that these students are engaged in. How effective has it been in developing the conceptual understanding that they will need after they graduate? Knowledge of the outcomes of a course of study: the conceptual understanding of these students, the misconceptions present in their models, and the dominant themes that drive their models, can inform ongoing efforts in curriculum development.

T1  - The Impact of Short Papers on Clinical Decision Making Skills of Nursing Students
AN  - 1875195297
AB  - Clinical decision making and critical thinking are fundamental skills to ensuring the success of undergraduate nursing students. Nursing faculty, and specifically clinical nursing faculty, are responsible for encouraging the development of these types of skills as students work in direct patient care. Traditional methods of clinical evaluation include lengthy case studies, concept mapping, and discussion board participation. While these methods have been in effect for some time, clinical short paper assignments are a fresh, innovative way to challenge students as they refine their critical thinking and clinical decision making abilities. No statistically significant difference was found between the perceived level of clinical decision making before and after the implementation of short written assignments; however, the overall mean score of clinical decision making abilities did increase following the implementation of clinical short papers.

T1  - An investigation of preservice teachers' understanding of buoyancy
AN  - 1871146928
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the conceptual understandings of 55 elementary preservice teachers for the concept of buoyancy. This study used Ausubel’s Assimilation Theory (Ausubel, 1963) as a framework for a 15-week intervention that used pre/post concept maps (Cmaps), pre/post face-to-face semi-structured interviews, and drawings as evidences for change of formation of cognitive structures. Using a convergent parallel design and mixed methods approach, preservice teachers’ conceptions were analyzed using these evidences. Results of the study show that preservice teachers held both scientific conceptions and misconceptions about buoyancy as a force before and after an instructional intervention. Of importance were the existence of robust misconceptions about buoyancy that included inaccurate scientific knowledge about the foundational concepts of gravity, weight, mass, and density. The largest gains in scientific knowledge included the concepts of gravity, surface area, opposing forces, and the buoyant force. These concepts were consistently supported with evidence from post-concept maps, post, semi-structured interviews, and drawings. However, high frequencies of misconceptions were associated with these same aforementioned concepts as well as additional misconceptions about buoyancy-related concepts (i.e., weight, density, displacement, and sinking/floating). A paired t test showed a statistically significant difference (t = -3.504, p = .001) in the total number of scientifically correct concepts for the pre-concept maps (M = 0.51, SD = .879) and post-concept maps (M = 1.25, SD = 1.542). The Cohen’s d effect size was small, .47. Even through gains for the pre/post concept maps were noted, a qualitative analysis of the results indicated that not only were there serious gaps in the participant’s scientific understanding of buoyancy, after the instructional intervention an increased number of misconceptions were presented alongside the newly learned concepts. A paired t test examining misconceptions showed that there was a statistically significant difference (t = -3.160, p = .003) in the total number of misconceptions for the pre-concept maps (M = 2.709, SD = 1.449) and post-concept maps (M = 3.363, SD = 2.094) after the intervention. The Cohen’s d effect size was small, .43.  Taken together, these results revealed that, in general, the preservice teachers had understandings of buoyancy that align with children in preschool and elementary school (Biddulph and Osborne, 1983; Grimellini-Tomasini et al., 1990; Halford, Brown & Thompson, 1986; Hsin and Wu, 2011; Kohn, 1993; Rappolt-Schlichtmann et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2008). Based on these findings, implications for this study suggest that elementary preservice teacher candidates should be carefully screened to ensure they have mastered foundational scientific knowledge that they are expected to teach to children. As such knowledge is a prerequisite to the development of pedagogical content knowledge, it is unlikely that large numbers of robust misconceptions will be significantly reduced or eliminated during a science methods course that is designed to focus on pedagogical content knowledge.

T1  - Making school discipline kinder: Developing a roadmap for youth well-being
AN  - 1858815913
AB  - BACKGROUND: School discipline—how schools manage and respond to student misbehavior—is a central component of how schools seek to create safe and productive learning environments. School suspensions have been a popular discipline strategy in recent decades. Yet, recent studies have demonstrated the association between punitive discipline strategies and poor outcomes in youth, including increased high school dropout rates, decreased odds of enrolling in postsecondary school, and increased mental health concerns. There is an urgent need to examine alternate mechanisms for addressing school discipline other than punitive exclusionary or reward-based systems. This dissertation seeks to develop an integrated model of promising approaches and define how such a system could work. OBJECTIVES: This dissertation is made up of three studies addressing three aims: (1) to synthesize the existing literature on how school discipline has been constructed and its impact on student well being; (2) to develop a novel conceptual model for an alternate discipline approach, “kind discipline,” and; (3) to develop and validate a measure for assessing the practice of kind discipline in elementary and middle schools. METHODS: Study one is a theoretical review utilizing a social ecological model to frame how school discipline models address an individual, relational, or structural level. Study two is a formative evaluation that develops a novel conceptual model for an alternative discipline approach. This study utilized concept mapping to elicit and integrate perspectives on school discipline from teachers, administrators, school staff, and other stakeholders involved in school programming. The concept mapping included a brainstorming phase, a statement analysis phase, a sorting and rating phase, and multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of the collected data. It culminated in a map that visually represent the group’s ideas and how they are interrelated. Study three validated a newly developed measure of kind discipline through an assessment of the measure’s internal consistency, an exploration of convergent and discriminant validity, and a descriptive analysis of the strength of relationships between kind discipline and school-level discipline frequency. RESULTS:  The theoretical review illustrated how different school discipline approaches address disparate explanations of what may lead to student misbehavior. The formative evaluation developed a conceptual model for kind discipline in which three core themes emerged from 11 identified clusters in the conceptual model: (1) proactively developing a positive school climate, (2) responding to conflict with empathy, accountability, and skill, and (3) supporting staff skills in understanding and sharing expectations. When mapped onto a social ecological model, the identified components of kind discipline encompassed all levels of that model including the individual, relational, environmental/structural, and even community levels. In the study validating a measure of kind discipline, teacher and student assessments of kind discipline were strongly correlated (Pearson’s Correlation -.772, p=0.005). Convergent validity of the measure was supported by our finding that the more positively students assessed kind discipline in their schools, the lower the school disciplinary action rate (β=-0.759, p=0.05). Mixed linear models showed teachers’ perceived kind discipline at the school level predicted individual students’ perception of kind discipline. Girls reported higher levels of kind discipline than boys; and students in higher grades reported lower levels of kind discipline than students in lower grades. CONCLUSIONS: Effective school discipline programs may need to operate on multiple levels. There is increasing support for the importance of a relationship-level component to disciplinary approaches. This contrasts with the dominant individual-behavioral discipline approaches that focus on fewer levels and may not lead to sustained student and staff motivation. The findings from the concept mapping illustrate the importance of setting and communicating clear expectations and the need for them to be collaboratively developed. The student and teacher measures for assessing the level of kind discipline in a school show promise as tools for evaluating schools working to improve approaches to discipline and for guiding interventions that aim to promote positive and relational motivation strategies.

T1  - Technology Acceptance and Course Completion Rates in Online Education: A Non-experimental, Mixed Method Study
AN  - 1858810794
AB  - As the need for quality online courses increase in demand, the acceptance of technology and completion rates become the focus of higher education.  The purpose of this non-experimental, mixed method study was to examine the relationship between the university students’ perceptions and acceptance of technology and learner completion rates with respect to the development of online courses.  This study involved 61 participants from two universities regarding their perceived usefulness (PU) of technology, intent to use technology, and intent to complete a course.  Two research questions were examined regarding student perceptions regarding technology employed in an online course and the relationship, if any, between technology acceptance and completion of an online university course.  The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used to collect data on the usefulness of course activities and student intent to complete the course.  An open-ended questionnaire was administered to collect information concerning student perceptions of course activities.  Quantitative data was analyzed using SPSS and Qualtrics, which indicated there was not a significant relationship between technology acceptance and course completion (p = .154).  Qualitative data were examined by pattern matching to create a concept map of the theoretical patterns between constructs.  Pattern matching revealed many students favored the use of the Internet over Canvas.  Furthermore, data showed students enrolled in online courses because of the flexibility and found the multimedia used in the courses as helpful in course completion.  Insight was investigated to offer reasons and decisions concerning choice that were made by the students.  Future recommendations are to expand mixed methods studies of technology acceptance in various disciplines to gain a better understanding of student perceptions of technology uses, intent to use, and course completion.

T1  - Differences in preferred teaching strategies: A quantitative study of nursing student perspectives
AN  - 1854165257
AB  - The preparation of nursing students to meet the demands of the nursing profession remains the goal of academic institutions worldwide.  The most productive methods of preparation, including specific teaching strategies to attain that goal, have long been debated.  This quantitative, non-experimental study included an investigation of the most preferred teaching strategies among baccalaureate degree nursing (BSN) students in an effort to support the development of best practice recommendations for meeting the andragogical needs of adult learners and aid in the preparation of effective nurses who practice safely.  The results of the study showed that BSN students most prefer hands-on, simulation-based teaching strategies and least prefer concept-mapping as a primary teaching strategy.  The results of the study also indicated that the only differences in preferred teaching strategies among BSN students were in relation to academic year, most specifically differences between junior and freshman academic years.  With regard to correlations between learning styles and preferred teaching strategies, the results of the study found significant correlations between BSN students’ self-identified learning styles and their preferred teaching strategies.  The results of the study indicated that nursing educators should implement hands-on, learner-centered teaching strategies in an attempt to meet the learning needs of BSN students.  Finally, the implications of the study support the use of students’ dominant learning styles to drive the choice of teaching strategies in the academic setting.

T1  - The "Concept Cloud": Supporting Collaborative Knowledge Construction Based on Semantic Extraction from Learner-Generated Artefacts

Explicit visual representations of domain knowledge have the potential to support students engaged in scientific inquiry learning activities on an epistemic level. This can be facilitated using computational methods for the extraction of concepts from student generated knowledge artefacts such as hypotheses, concept maps, or wiki articles. We propose an application of this approach in the context of inquiry learning with online science laboratories. As a cognitive awareness tool, the "concept cloud" presents domain concepts and key phrases to the learners in order to help them reflect on their own learning and knowledge building. As part of a learning analytics toolset, the concept cloud also supports teachers in supervising their students' knowledge building from an epistemic perspective. The approach has been tested in a classroom scenario with 84 secondary high school students.

In this paper, we track the scaffolding of the pre-requisites needed in high school level physics concepts and use this information to design the higher-level scaffolding of the same concepts in a university freshmen physics course. This tracking is performed as a meta-cognitive activity inside the classrooms, using a well-established concept visualization tool called “concept maps”. Further, these maps will be extended to include higher-level concepts in the engineering courses that have the physics course as a pre-requisite. This paper presents the insights from a pilot implementation of this technique in a freshman physics course. We used concept map as an additional instruction method to aid the students to visually connect the pre-requisite and the newly delivered concepts. This will allow students to understand what they know and what they need to learn. The effectiveness of this method is measured using the data collected from class quizzes and tests. The paper summarizes the initial results from this study along with a discussion on how such earlier maps developed at freshmen level can be extended to higher-level engineering classes for creating engaged classrooms using a novel teaching-learning frame work under development titled “Tracking Evolution Architecture of Cognitive Hierarchy Maps for Engaged Classrooms” (TEACH ME).

Preserving important troubleshooting experience gained in industrial practice, often referred to as “tribal knowledge”, and making it readily available to be re-applied in similar situations represent a serious challenge for many companies in heavy industry. The solution is very often tied to building mental models to capture and express key latent cognitive variables. In this paper, we first attempt to identify the appropriate knowledge-based system diagnosis paradigms. A conceptual map-based framework is then proposed as a potential solution for retaining tribal knowledge. The validity and feasibility of the approach are demonstrated through a training program developed under the support of National Science Foundation (NSF) for improving engineering and technology students' troubleshooting skills.

T1  - A meta-analysis of the effects of non-traditional teaching methods on the critical thinking abilities of nursing students
AN  - 1825038146
AB  - Background               Scientific framework is important in designing curricula and evaluating students in the field of education and clinical practice. The purpose of this study was to examine the effectiveness of non-traditional educational methods on critical thinking skills.               Methods               A systematic review approach was applied. Studies published in peer-reviewed journals from January 2001 to December 2014 were searched using electronic databases and major education journals. A meta-analysis was performed using Review Manager 5.2. Reviewing the included studies, the California Critical Thinking Dispositions Inventory (CCTDI) and California Critical Thinking Skills Test (CCTST) were used to assess the effectiveness of critical thinking in the meta-analysis.               Results               The eight CCTDI datasets showed that non- traditional teaching methods (i.e., no lectures) were more effective compared to control groups (standardized mean difference [SMD]: 0.42, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.26-0.57, p < .00001). And six CCTST datasets showed the teaching and learning methods in these studies were also had significantly more effects when compared to the control groups (SMD: 0.29, 95 % CI: 0.10-0.48, p = 0.003).               Conclusions               This research showed that new teaching and learning methods designed to improve critical thinking were generally effective at enhancing critical thinking dispositions.

T1  - The SOS-framework (Systems of Sedentary behaviours): an international transdisciplinary consensus framework for the study of determinants, research priorities and policy on sedentary behaviour across the life course: a DEDIPAC-study
AN  - 1808215842
AB  - Background              Ecological models are currently the most used approaches to classify and conceptualise determinants of sedentary behaviour, but these approaches are limited in their ability to capture the complexity of and interplay between determinants. The aim of the project described here was to develop a transdisciplinary dynamic framework, grounded in a system-based approach, for research on determinants of sedentary behaviour across the life span and intervention and policy planning and evaluation.              Methods              A comprehensive concept mapping approach was used to develop the Systems Of Sedentary behaviours (SOS) framework, involving four main phases: (1) preparation, (2) generation of statements, (3) structuring (sorting and ranking), and (4) analysis and interpretation. The first two phases were undertaken between December 2013 and February 2015 by the DEDIPAC KH team (DEterminants of DIet and Physical Activity Knowledge Hub). The last two phases were completed during a two-day consensus meeting in June 2015.              Results              During the first phase, 550 factors regarding sedentary behaviour were listed across three age groups (i.e., youths, adults and older adults), which were reduced to a final list of 190 life course factors in phase 2 used during the consensus meeting. In total, 69 international delegates, seven invited experts and one concept mapping consultant attended the consensus meeting. The final framework obtained during that meeting consisted of six clusters of determinants: Physical Health and Wellbeing (71 % consensus), Social and Cultural Context (59 % consensus), Built and Natural Environment (65 % consensus), Psychology and Behaviour (80 % consensus), Politics and Economics (78 % consensus), and Institutional and Home Settings (78 % consensus). Conducting studies on Institutional Settings was ranked as the first research priority. The view that this framework captures a system-based map of determinants of sedentary behaviour was expressed by 89 % of the participants.              Conclusion              Through an international transdisciplinary consensus process, the SOS framework was developed for the determinants of sedentary behaviour through the life course. Investigating the influence of Institutional and Home Settings was deemed to be the most important area of research to focus on at present and potentially the most modifiable. The SOS framework can be used as an important tool to prioritise future research and to develop policies to reduce sedentary time.

T1  - Building the Foundation: Utilizing Concept Maps to Enhance Critical Thinking in First Semester Nursing Students
AN  - 1805571153
AB  - Critical thinking and clinical decision making are essential components of the knowledge and skills necessary for all nurses in order to make complex decisions that improve patient outcomes, safety, and quality of nursing care. Promoting student competence in critical thinking skills is imperative for nurse educators. Concept mapping is an active teaching strategy that can assist nurse educators in preparing nursing students to think critically in today’s complex health care environment. The purpose of this project was to implement concept maps as an additional instructional activity with first semester Associate Degree Nursing (ADN) students to promote confidence in basic critical thinking skills. It was foreseen the first semester ADN student would demonstrate beginning skills in concept map development anticipated to lead to critical thinking applicable in the practice of nursing.

T1  - Nursing Distance Learning Course Comparison of Assignments and Examination Scores
AN  - 1803636282
AB  - Nursing programs have embraced distance learning in their curricula, but discussion is ongoing about course assignments and grading criteria to increase examination scores in nursing distance learning courses.  Because course examinations are a predictor of success on the postgraduate licensing examination (NCLEX-RN), the purpose of this study was to determine whether differences existed in student examination scores between nursing distance learning courses with and without points aligned to assignments.  The theoretical framework was Knowles’s theory of andragogy, which highlights adults’ motivation and self-direction to succeed.  The quantitative causal comparative study included a convenience sample of 164 students to compare archival data of 4 examination scores between 2 nursing distance-learning courses.  Data analysis included an independent-groups one-tailed  t test. No significant differences were found between the 2 courses, suggesting that students do not achieve higher examination scores with course points aligned with course assignments.  Nursing administrators and faculty in nursing programs with a distance learning component will benefit from the findings of this study.  Findings may be used to draft, revise, and implement assignment criteria and point alignment for nursing distance learning courses.  Social change will occur when nursing distance learning faculty use problem-solving and critical thinking assignments, including case studies, discussion boards, group assignments, concept mapping and NCLEX-RN style testing in each nursing distance learning course.  Because point alignment to course assignments do not significantly improve examination scores, implementation of problem-solving and critical thinking assignments is necessary to promote student learning and examination success.

T1  - Application of conceptual maps as didactic and pedagogical tools in the area of resources and information services
AN  - 1802647396
AB  - Objective. Analyze the use of concept maps as didactic and pedagogical tools, from an experiment conducted in the classroom, in the disciplines Specialized Sources and Information Services of the graduation in Librarianship. Method. The methodological approach is characterized by its applied nature, exploratory and observation. Data were collected from the students by applying a questionnaire, and analysis took place with the help of content analysis techniques. Results. The most students see the conceptual maps as facilitators of knowledge construction, and view the use of these in different contexts, like the librarian activities. Conclusions. The use of concept maps as didactic and pedagogical tools can foster in students the enhancement of learning and reflection on the establishment of a route for the shared construction of new knowledge, adding previous knowledge and transforming them for use in cognitive fill gaps.

T1  - New methods for analyzing semantic graph based assessments in science education
AN  - 1797588610
AB  - This research investigated how the scoring of semantic graphs (known by many as concept maps) could be improved and automated in order to address issues of inter-rater reliability and scalability. As part of the NSF funded SENSE-IT project to introduce secondary school science students to sensor networks (NSF Grant No. 0833440), semantic graphs illustrating how temperature change affects water ecology were collected from 221 students across 16 schools. The graphing task did not constrain students’ use of terms, as is often done with semantic graph based assessment due to coding and scoring concerns. The graphing software used provided real-time feedback to help students learn how to construct graphs, stay on topic and effectively communicate ideas. The collected graphs were scored by human raters using assessment methods expected to boost reliability, which included adaptations of traditional holistic and propositional scoring methods, use of expert raters, topical rubrics, and criterion graphs. High levels of inter-rater reliability were achieved, demonstrating that vocabulary constraints may not be necessary after all.    To investigate a new approach to automating the scoring of graphs, thirty-two different graph features characterizing graphs’ structure, semantics, configuration and process of construction were then used to predict human raters’ scoring of graphs in order to identify feature patterns correlated to raters’ evaluations of graphs’ topical accuracy and complexity. Results led to the development of a regression model able to predict raters’ scoring with 77% accuracy, with 46% accuracy expected when used to score new sets of graphs, as estimated via cross-validation tests. Although such performance is comparable to other graph and essay based scoring systems, cross-context testing of the model and methods used to develop it would be needed before it could be recommended for widespread use. Still, the findings suggest techniques for improving the reliability and scalability of semantic graph based assessments without requiring constraint of how ideas are expressed.

T1  - MOBILE APPLICATIONS FOR CONCEPT MAPS: ANALYSIS AND PROPOSED CRITERIA FOR ITS USE IN EDUCATION
AN  - 1792388348
AB  - The learning orientation towards the acquisition of basic competencies represents a shift in the ways of learning. In order to solve the problems of everyday life (present and future), the emphasis is on the achievement of basic skills that integrate formal (academic), non-formal and informal learning. In addition, they attempt to encourage the development of lifelong learning. In this paper, we use the "Digital Competence" and "Learning to Learn" as a starting point for the analysis of different mobile applications (apps). The "Digital Competence" is based on the acquisition of skills to obtain, process, organize and communicate information with the intention to transform it into knowledge, using different resources and based on ICT supports. Meanwhile, the "Learning to Learn" competence is based on the acquisition of the necessary skills that allow us to regulate our own learning processes in an autonomous and efficient way. The development of this competence involves assimilation and awareness of the abilities that come into play in learning as finding, understanding, selection, analysis, synthesis and association of relevant information. According to the latest contributions of neurocognitive and constructivist psychology, mind and concept maps are highly useful strategies for the development of the competencies mentioned above. This study is based on two objectives: 1. Perform an updated review of the major scientific contributions related to the development and implementation of concept maps with educational purposes; 2. Analyse the most frequent apps that are used which allow the development of concept maps. In this way, we obtain information on the relevance and variety of work areas in which mind maps are used, defining criteria analysis for the apps. Based on these criteria, apps are analysed according to the intended purpose. The procedure used comes from a review of the most relevant scientific production on the topics addressed (250 retrieved documents), included in the database Web of Science (ISI) and Scopus. The recovered production is analysed according to the areas of knowledge, education levels, years; countries and major conclusions. In addition, we developed a matrix analysis including forty apps for the development of concept and mind maps. These apps have been analysed according to the degree of compliance with the following criteria; usability; accessibility, visual design, interaction design, portability, cost, support/setting and synchronization. Finally, the paper concludes by synthesizing the most important contributions and giving a series of recommendations for the use of mobile applications for the elaboration of concept maps with educational purposes.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping applied in case studies in prenursing students' learning and perceptions of learning
AN  - 1791141676
AB  - In nursing education, there is a need for effective educational strategies to foster nursing students’ knowledge, skills, and abilities that are required to succeed in the NCLEX-RN examination and to provide quality nursing care in the healthcare environment. The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of concept mapping applied in case studies on nursing students’ learning and perceptions of learning. This study used a quasi-experimental, quantitative, comparative pre- and posttest research design that had a convenience sample of 93 prenursing students consisting of 53 subjects in the experimental group and 40 subjects in the control group. The experimental group used concept mapping applied in case studies as an educational strategy while the control group used only case studies. Scores on two content tests of the experimental group were compared with those of the control group by using a MANOVA to compare the groups’ learning. The participants’ perceptions of learning promoted by concept mapping applied in case studies in comparison with that promoted by using case study alone were collected through a survey and analyzed descriptively.    The results indicated that there were no significant differences in achievement between participants who used concept mapping applied in the case studies and those who used only the case studies. Also, there were no significant differences in achievement on each of the content tests associated with the case studies between participants who used concept mapping applied in the case studies and those who used only the case studies. The findings of this study might be derived from several factors such as the circumstance of conducting this study, the participants’ perceptions and comfort level with participating in this study, seriousness in taking tests, the brevity of the experiment, and participants’ developmental stages.    Other results of this study indicated that students felt they gained better skills in working effectively with others through concept mapping as applied in the case studies as compared to having case studies only. Students also agreed that they gained a better understanding of how studying nursing helps people address real world issues through concept mapping as applied in the case studies as compared to having only case studies. Moreover, the felt they gained a better understanding of how to use a critical approach to analyze data and arguments in daily life through concept mapping as applied in the case studies as compared to having only case studies. These findings may be due to tasks that are involved in developing concept maps, a deep approach promoted by concept mapping, and the effect of concept mapping that promotes critical thinking. Concept mapping applied in case studies can be used to develop students’ analysis, problem solving, and teamwork skills.

Computer-mediated learning needs to be social too. Interactivity is a central construct for collaborative knowledge construction in online communities. We present an operationalized framework for measuring interactivity in online discussions, based on our view of interactivity as a socio-constructivist process. We hypothesize that the traditional design for online discussion platforms, with linear, chronologically threaded forums and bulletin boards, would result in less interactive behavioral patterns. We propose a semantic network topology to online discussions, which in turn reflects a social constructivist process. To that end, we developed Ligilo, an online discussion platform. Here, each discussion contribution and content item is expressed as a node in a semantic network of posts. We describe a field study comparing interactivity using threaded-based discussion and Ligilo's semantic, networked based discussion. Initial results indicate higher interactivity in content creation patterns, suggesting learning, motivation and sustainability for discussion and community.

T1  - Comparing two forms of concept map critique activities to facilitate knowledge integration processes in evolution education
AN  - 1773420811
AB  - Concept map activities often lack a subsequent revision step that facilitates knowledge integration. This study compares two collaborative critique activities using a Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), a form of concept map. Four classes of high school biology students (n=81) using an online inquiry-based learning unit on evolution were assigned to one of two conditions. Student dyads in one condition compared their concept maps against an expert map while dyads in the other condition conducted a peer-review. Analysis of the concept maps suggests that students in both conditions improved their understanding of evolution from pretest to posttest. However, the two conditions lead to different criteria: Students in the expert-map condition focused mostly on concept-focused criteria like concept classification while students in the peer-review condition used more link-focused criteria like link labels and missing connections. This paper suggests that both forms of KIM critique activities can be beneficial for constructing more coherent connections across different topics in evolution education. These results support the value of collaborative KIM critique activities and help clarify the forms of collaborative activities that are most likely to be effective to facilitate knowledge integration processes. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

T1  - Connecting with pre-service teachers' perspectives on the use of digital technologies and social media to teach socially relevant science
AN  - 1986317107
AB  - As an interdisciplinary team of educational researchers we explored pre-service science teachers' perspectives on using digital technologies and social media to address socially relevant issues in science teaching. The rationale for teaching socially relevant science was embedded in the concept of renaiscience, thus underscoring the need for science to be perceived as a human activity. We drew on generational theory to consider the educational significance of digital technologies and social media. Two different activities were used to elicit the pre-service science teachers' perspectives. First, we invited them to reflect on a digital animation that we had produced, and they highlighted the advantages of digital animation as a medium to communicate a socially relevant message more appealingly to the Millennial generation. We then engaged these pre-service teachers in a structured concept-mapping activity to consider how digital technologies and social media might be used to address social challenges in South Africa. They drew our attention to the affordances of digital technologies and social media as a means to facilitate critical thinking, cater for diverse learning styles, and make high-quality scientific knowledge more accessible. They highlighted that teaching socially relevant science using digital resources can be cheap, convenient, collaborative, and creative.

T1  - The effects of scientific representations on primary students' development of scientific discourse and conceptual understandings during cooperative contemporary inquiry-science
AN  - 1732944123
AB  - Teaching students to use and interpret representations in science is critically important if they are to become scientifically literate and learn how to communicate their understandings and learning in science. This study involved 248 students (119 boys and 129 girls) from 26 grade 6 teachers' classes in nine primary schools in Brisbane, Australia. Teachers were randomly allocated by school to one of three conditions: the contemporary science + representations condition (Experimentala), the contemporary condition (Experimentalb), or the comparison condition as they participated in an eight-week inquiry-science unit on Natural Disasters. Data on students' discourse were collected at two time points during the implementation of the unit and data on the concept maps were collected pre- and post-intervention while data on the reasoning and problem-solving (RP-S) task were collected following the intervention. The results show that when students participate in an inquiry-based science unit that is augmented with a variety of multimedia resources presenting a range of current contemporary events (Experimentala and Experimentalb conditions), they demonstrate significantly more social language and basic scientific language and marked increases in moderate scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition. Interestingly, although there were no significant differences on the Personal Concept Map scores between the conditions at Times 1 and 2, the students' scores in all conditions improved decidedly across time. It appears that as the children had more time to engage with the material, participate in cooperative peer discussions, and receive encouragement from their teachers to provide elaborated feedback to each other, their conceptual understandings of earthquakes were enhanced. However, although the children in the experimental conditions demonstrated significantly more social and scientific language than their peers in the comparison condition, these oral language skills did not transfer to the RP-S task, possibly because they may not have had enough time to consolidate their application in a novel context where they had to work independently.

T1  - What Library 2.0 has taught libraries in Taiwan about e-learning
AN  - 1744926999
AB  - Purpose - This paper aims to review the four elements of Library 2.0, which represents a major innovation, and adopts several pedagogical concepts to investigate other innovations libraries in Taiwan could implement to become ideal libraries. Design/methodology/approach - This paper presents an overview of the essential principles of Library 2.0 and examines the current state of libraries in Taiwan. The authors then present a reciprocal feedback model of Library 2.0+. Findings - A Library 2.0+ model and a concept map of the mutualism between e-learning education and Library 2.0+ were proposed to diminish the gap between the status quo and Library 2.0. Two recommendations are provided: to develop a library learning platform to maximize the education value of the library, and to regard library development as part of the overall community's development. Users can access library resources anytime/anywhere by visiting the library learning platform without visiting the library. Allowing an individual approach is necessary to realize the social educational value of the library. Moreover, a Library 2.0 library engages more in community development and invites participation with participation in community first. Universities in the community would be good technology partners when developing a Library 2.0 library. Originality/value - Although there has been extensive research of library development in view of Library 2.0, such a topic has never been explored with an educational perspective, especially an e-learning perspective. Given that the definition of Library 2.0 is abstract and fairly broad, the authors take the view of an e-learning platform to make Library 2.0 more figurative. Moreover, through interdisciplinary exploration, concrete suggestions regarding library development are provided to librarians, especially those with similar conditions as those in Taiwan.

T1  - Learning aids for students taking physics
AN  - 2733172666
AB  - If a person has ‘a problem’ to solve and knows the solution and just has to apply it (retrieve it from memory and re-act), it is not a problem—it is a task; if a person does not know the solution and has to create it—this is a problem. Using this language, there are only two situations: (a) one has to perform a task; or (b) one has to solve a problem by creating a new (for the person) procedure, i.e. one has to create a brand new (for the one) solution; of course, one must utilize some of the knowledge previously stored in the memory (we could call this action ‘creative utilization of previous knowledge’).If a student learned how to perform a task, he or she can repeat it in the future as many times as this student has to repeat the same task. The key word is ‘the same’. Our brain is a powerful pattern recognition machine. As soon as it recognizes the task, it retrieves from memory the sequence of the actions, which has to be performed to succeed. If a brain does not recognize the task, we have two options: (a) the task is the same but due to some features it is camouflaged as a different one; (b) the task is different from the ones in the past and is really new for the brain, and the brain does not have the solution (at least in full) in its storage. Of course, we assume that a particular brain is capable of storing and retrieving the information and governing the actions required for fulfilling the task (otherwise we have to discuss a case of learning disabilities).Based on this approach, every teacher has to teach students to two different practices: (a) how to perform specific tasks (the set of those tasks should be specified by a curriculum); (b) how to create a solution to a problem which has not been solved in the past (by that person); the latter practice, in turn, requires a practice in making a conclusion regarding the familiarity of the given assignment—is it the same as one from the past (is it a task?) or different (is it a problem?)? Development of such a skill also requires specific practice.Teaching how to find a solution means (in part) teaching how to recognize the old task in the new one and to apply the appropriate method (which worked in the past).Teaching how to create/invent a solution which has not been presented/trained before (at least in full) means teaching thinking creatively (a.c.a. critically). Although due to the definition of ‘creativity’the act of creating something new should be seen as the result of an insight, a teacher can help a student to get to that insight as close as possible using specific teaching tools (learning aids).Many teaching instruments of the kind have been discussed and offered by various research. For example, E F Redish () offers a general framework for Physics Education Research based on modeling student thinking. ‘Teaching Introductory Physics’ by Arnold B Arons () is an invaluable source of many teaching tools and techniques. Many specific teaching strategies, including examples of mapping and guided thinking one will find in the works of K Heller and P Heller (). A Elby () provides a broad summary on helping students learn how to learn (including asking prompting questions). D Rosengrant et al () offer a study of the use of diagrams, including free-body diagrams, as a helping tool for solving problems in mechanics. D Van Domelen provides a review of the use of strategy maps and thinking algorithms. An excellent recourse letter is provided by L C McDermont and E F Redish (). The use of concept maps in education has been discussed in details by J D Novak ().In these works a reader will find a description of several tools which the author finds also helpful for students learning how to solve physics problems. These tools help students to get a better understanding of how a mind of an expert problem solver works when solving a problem.

T1  - Companion apps for information-rich television programmes: representation and interaction
AN  - 1713728868
AB  - Issue Title: Theme issue on advances in the Internet of Thins: identification, information, and knowledge              The use of a companion app to augment viewing of information-rich television programmes is investigated. The app displays a synchronised graphical abstraction of a programme's content in the form of a concept map. Two experiments were conducted involving participants watching an astronomy documentary with the app. The first compared watching the programme with and without the app, and the second compared non-interactive and interactive versions of the app. Understanding of the programme, cross-device gaze behaviour, and user experience of the app were assessed. Our results show that the companion app improved participants' understanding and recall of the programme. Participants were found to manage their visual attention systematically when using the companion app, and correlations were found in the way they shifted their gaze from TV screen to tablet and back in response to changes in the programme content. Increasing interaction with the app disrupted understanding of the television programme and visual attention. Participants were positive about the value of companion apps for understanding and recall of programmes, but distraction and 'knowing where to look' were significant concerns.

T1  - Adaptive systems: a content analysis on technical side for e-learning environments
AN  - 1710608038
AB  - Adaptive systems refer to autonomous interactive systems that adjust their behavior and functionality to environmental changes. In e-learning context, adaptive e-learning systems (AESs) adapt their services to users interests, knowledge and goals. In order to investigate the trend of researches in the field of adaptation in e-learning systems, a comprehensive survey of research papers in this context is presented. In this regard, 190 research papers, published between 2000 and 2012, from 45 journals are reviewed and analyzed. The basic contributions of the paper are manifold. First, it provides classifications of research papers from two different points of view: the adaptive technologies utilized in research papers in order to provide adaptation services for AESs and the application fields of research papers in AESs as research goals. Second, it presents statistical analyses on adaptive technologies and application fields. The analyses are carried out based on publication year of papers, the publication year versus adaptive technologies, the publication year versus application fields and adaptive technologies versus application fields. Third, the open problems, current state and prospective direction of researches in AESs are discussed. Finally, the paper suggests what adaptive technology might be the best choice for ongoing researches in each application field.

This paper describes implementation and evaluation of a method for automatic creation of concept map from unstructured text written in the Croatian language. The method combines statistical and data mining techniques with domain thesaurus and tools specific for linguistic analysis of the Croatian language. We created concept maps from legal documents in the field of science, education and technology and evaluated the content of created concept maps comparing them with manually created summaries. Obtained results confirmed that using the described method, it is possible to create concept maps from documents in a specific area, and those maps illustrate the contents of the source documents well.

Quantitative assessment of learning is an important indicator of teaching practices apart from the depth and grasp of content being assessed. Fundamental objective of assessment approaches should help promote learner engagement and is appropriate to the diversity of learners that may be present in any class. Learning from online or virtual classrooms can be more challenging due to lack of direct personal engagement between the teacher and the student. There are various modes of assessment commonly adopted today and students may exhibit different levels of performance based on the assessment method. This paper focuses on cross-comparison of these techniques to learning of laboratory concepts in a virtual environment. Apart from comparison of the commonly used assessment methods such as multiple choice questions, descriptive questions, true/false statements etc., the work explores the best methodology to correlate assessment from a reliability and validity perspective to the learning objectives and measure the progress of individual students. Correlating the innate learning styles of students to assessment approaches is another outcome of this work. In addition, the use of concept maps to assess the relationship between various science based principles is characterized for two different experimental labs with N=147 students. The advantages to using assessment techniques from a 'time-toassess' is also elaborated in this work.

T1  - Process modeling and decision mining in a collaborative distance learning environment
AN  - 1704802047
AB  - This paper is divided into four main parts. In the first part of the study, we identified the most significant factors that affect the performance of groups in collaborative learning situations. The results showed that the extent of communication, interactions and involvement/participation between students have crucial impacts on the performance of groups. In the second part of the study, we defined and explained specific alphabets and keywords derived from a collected event log during a distance learning activity using a real-time multi-user concept mapping service. Our aim was to interpret the data in such a way that eventually can increase the instructor's awareness about entire the collaborative process. In the third part of the study, we used several statistical and process mining techniques in order to discover and compare distinguished patterns of interaction and involvement between the groups with high and low performance. The results showed that the extent of students' interaction was four times greater in the high performance groups. Similarly, the extent of students' involvement and participation was three times greater in the high performance groups compared with the low performance groups. In the fourth part of the study, we analyzed the extent of communication with respect to textual and semantic contributions of the students written/typed and shared in the chat rooms during the online distance activity. The results showed that the level of students' communication was two times greater in the groups with high performance. And finally, we applied a Decision Tree/Rules technique to extract a model of decisions (as well as their possible consequences) about performance of groups in collaborative learning situations.

Digital games have become a popular source of entertainment. The main reason that players continue to play video games is that the game designers use scaffolding to bridge the gap between a player's current skills and those needed to be successful at the next level. Several mainstream digital games have the flexibility to become promising game-based learning environments, in which scaffolding could play a crucial role to improve the learning experience. This study examines the effectiveness of providing instructors with the opportunity to tailor a digital game in order to meet their personal teaching goals. The built-in game features in Crayon Physics Deluxe are blended with instructor-designed scaffolding to see whether such features can assist learning without impeding creativity. A total of 126 participants were divided into four groups. In three of the groups, Crayon Physics Deluxe was used with varied scaffolding conditions: demonstration scaffolding, non-scaffolding, and marking critical features scaffolding. The fourth group did not play the game. Learning outcomes were examined in terms of physics knowledge acquisition (in the form of concept maps) and creativity performance (in the form of game episode designs). The results show that the marking critical features scaffolding group performed significantly better than the demonstration scaffolding group in both conceptual knowledge acquisition and in the sensitivity dimension of design creativity. The group with demonstration scaffolding scored higher in the flexibility dimension of creativity when designing their own game episodes. These findings suggest that proper scaffolding does facilitate learning, and different learning purposes require various designs of scaffoldings.

T1  - PROJECT-BASED LEARNING BASED UPON THE CONSTRUCTIVIST METHOD FOR HIGH SCHOOL PHYSICS LESSONS
AN  - 1681285581
AB  - The focus of this paper is to introduce the idea of project-based learning. An example is to implement project-based learning environments into the curriculum but yet still prepare students for high stakes standardized tests with an emphasis on performance. In addition to traditional course materials such as lectures and problem sets were used Open Educational Resources, online collaborative document creation and conceptual maps construction, also an online interactive space that helps users build a learning community. Web 2.0 tools have helped in organizing and completing work stages of projects for groups of students. Wikispaces for Education Platform provides facilities for creating workspaces and allocation the members of each group; access and editing rights management; automatic creation of links for easy navigation between groups pages; the perfect host for multimedia content, easily added, edited and formatted. Teaching included with Technology offered a greater amount of enthusiasm for learning among students and also it has brought more benefits. Students worked under their preferred intelligence, were excited to use their smart phones to take photos and record movies with simple experiments, interacted with their peers to problem solve and process information, and created a final product that demonstrates the knowledge they obtained, with a higher level of retention of the material being taught. As a review of the unit, they posted what they had learned as conceptual maps with resources. And because this work lived on the wiki, all the students in the class, regardless of which group they worked in, had a chance to learn from their peers - and could even go back to it to study for tests.

T1  - Hybrid Engineering Matriculation Model to Promote Informed Engineering-Major Selection Decisions
AN  - 2317758453
AB  - Hybrid Introduction to Engineering Model to Promote Informed Engineering-Major Selection Decisions Students who chose an engineering major because they identify with the engineering-relatedactivities of that field are more likely to be retained. The limited knowledge of engineering thatmost students posses when they choose an engineering major negatively effects theircommitment to their selected major (Lichtenstein et al., 2007). Introduction to engineeringcourses are one way to promote informed engineering major decisions among engineeringstudents (Argrow et al., 2012; Orr, Brawner, Ohland, & Layton, 2013). However, one of the most prominent models for first-year engineering is the directmatriculation model (Chen, Brawner, Ohland, & Orr, 2013), in which students must select amajor before enrolling in a single university-level course. While some high schools do haveengineering courses, many, especially those in poor rural areas, do not. In areas withoutengineering courses, students often rely on non-engineering professionals (e.g., high schoolcounselors) to make engineering-major decisions. Despite efforts to “change the conversation”,it is still commonplace for these non-engineering professionals to state that a student shouldmajor in engineering simply because the student excels in math and science. Thus, the directmatriculation model often involves uninformed decision making when students are choosing amajor. For retention purposes, it is important for colleges of engineering to support informeddecisions regarding engineering-major choice. In this paper we discuss our efforts to promote informed decision making within the contextof a direct matriculation model. We are exploring a hybrid model for first-year engineering thatpreserves our existing eight major-specific introduction to engineering course within our eightengineering departments and adds a general introduction to engineering course for undecidedstudents. In this paper, we discuss some of the challenges we faced while transitioning to the hybridmodel. For example, one challenge we faced when developing the general introduction toengineering course focused on addressing differences between existing major-specific courses.While preparing for our new intro course, in Fall 2013 we conducted an assessment of existingmajor-specific intro courses at our institution. We used Reid et al.’s (2013) first-yearengineering classification scheme to examine differences and similarities for course content inthe existing courses. After identifying substantial differences in content, instructional design,and credit hours across all eight major-specific courses, we acknowledged that developing ageneral introduction to engineering course that would satisfy all requirements for all departmentswas not feasible without significant curricula changes. Instead we focused on developing acourse that would satisfy requirements for a majority of departments and clearly informedstudents of the departments that would require their own major-specific intro course in additionto the general course. This and other challenges to our hybrid model are discussed. We also discuss course design details in the full paper. In Fall 2014, our general introductionto engineering course was piloted. The course was taught by six faculty and was comprised offour engineering modules (engineering mechanics, process engineering, product dissection, andtech writing) and panel sessions that introduce students to the various engineering degreeprograms. Through an analysis of students’ pre/post-course concept maps and course surveys, weevaluated students’ understanding of the differences between disciplines and the impact ofvarious components of the course on their engineering major selection decisions.Argrow, B.M., Louie, B., Knight, D.W., Canney, N.E., Brown, S., Banford, A.J., Gibson, C.L.,and Kenney, E.D.

T1  - How Misconceptions Might be Repaired Through Inquiry-Based Activities
AN  - 2317751592
AB  - How Misconceptions Might be Repaired through Inquiry Based ActivitiesAlthough widespread in STEM disciplines, traditional instructional methods typically have littlesuccess at producing robust conceptual understanding in students. Nearly 7700 studies in STEMeducation research literature reported on student alternative conceptions. Growing evidence alsoshows that aligning these naïve conceptions to more expert conceptual understanding requiresmore than just pointing out the difference in passing during lecture. An approach that showspromise is inquiry-based instruction. By presenting students with a physical situation and askingthem to predict what will happen, they can then investigate the situation on their own byexperimenting with the laboratory modules. In this way the physical world is now the “authority”rather than the instructor.In this paper, the efficacy of inquiry-based activities used in undergraduate dynamics is explored.This course is often cited as one of the most challenging engineering courses in the curriculum,and many of the topics are in direct conflict with students’ perception of the world around them.An exploratory qualitative study was pursued using a small sample of undergraduate studentstaking a course in dynamics. The students participated in an individual inquiry-based activity thatexamined the relationship between force, mass and acceleration in systems of pulleys. Thestudents were asked to make predictions and explain their reasoning throughout the exercise by“thinking” aloud. Video recordings of students’ engagement were collected and the discoursewas coded as a series of concept maps. The purpose was to look at the student’s existingconcepts and links and how they evolve as the student is exposed to different cases. We alsowanted to understand why their concept maps evolve the way they evolve. By doing this, wedetermined if and when the students had their “ah hah” moment and the path that students take toget there. Our study goes in-depth by trying to determine exactly why the inquiry-based modulesmight work or not. The analysis model developed for this study will possibly serve as a modelfor similar inquiry-based activities in different engineering fields to help evaluate their success.Furthermore, this work could also help broadly in the design of new inquiry-based activities thatincorporate more of the knowledge available in the literature.

T1  - Using Students-Generated Concept Maps to Assess Students’ Conceptual Understanding in a Foundational Engineering Course
AN  - 2317750191
AB  - Using Students-Generated Concept Maps to Assess Students’ Conceptual Understanding in a Foundational Engineering CourseThis paper reports the results of an engineering education project funded by the NSF TUES-Type1 program. One primary goal of the project is to improve student conceptual understanding andcomprehension in a foundational yet difficult undergraduate engineering course – EngineeringDynamics (ED).Nearly all students in mechanical, aerospace, civil, biological, and biomedical engineeringprograms are required to take this course. The course covers a broad spectrum of foundationalconcepts, such as displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, work, energy, impulse, momentum,and vibration. Nonetheless, ED is widely regarded as one of the most difficult courses tosucceed in. In a recent survey, students were asked about their perspectives about ED. Morethan 60% of the students surveyed used phrases, such as “much harder than Statics,” “extremelydifficult,” “very challenging,” and “are afraid of it.” Students often drop out of engineeringbecause they fail this course – the last pre-professional gateway course before entering aprofessional engineering program.Research has shown that conceptual understanding plays a critical role in students’ problem-solving performance. Assessing conceptual understanding is important in order to design themost appropriate pedagogy to improve students’ problem-solving performance. Theconventional way to assess conceptual understanding is to conduct assessment tests (such as theConcept Inventory Test) and/or interviews. In this study, conceptual understanding wereassessed through students-generated concept maps. Guided by active learning andconstructivism theories, students developed their own concept maps after they had learned anengineering dynamics theme (i.e., a chapter in a dynamics textbook). Students-generatedconcept maps were closely examined. This paper presents representative concept mapsgenerated by students who took dynamics in a recent semester. The results show that students-generated concept maps provide a significant amount of information on their understandingand/or misunderstandings of relevant concepts and can be used as a supplemental tool to assessconceptual understanding in this foundational engineering course.

T1  - Providing Deep, Foundational Learning in an Introductory Energy Systems & Sustainability Course
AN  - 2317747583
AB  - Providing Deep, Foundational Learning in an Introductory Energy Conversion & Sustainability CourseEnergy conversion and other resource usage are foundational topics that have far-reachingeconomic, societal, and environmental impacts. Furthermore, they are inextricably linked, whereenergy is needed to extract resources and resources are needed to convert between differentforms of energy. The Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) has identified“resource management” (including energy) as one of the “…most important trends shaping ourworld out to the year 2035” [1].Recently universities have begun to strengthen and/or develop programs in the energy area. Anexample of this is the Consortium of Universities for Sustainable Power (CUSP)TM, the goal ofwhich is to “…collectively evolve and promote the curriculum develop[ment]…” in this area [2].It was within this context that a new Sustainable Energy concentration was developed at theauthors’ university. This concentration is composed of courses such as power electronics, powertransmission and distribution, and electro-mechanical systems. A new course entitled EnergySystems & Sustainability was also developed.This new course is designed to provide a broad overview and allows both engineering and non-engineering students to gain exposure to these areas. The primary course objectives are forstudents to be able to: • Understand and use appropriate terminology to discuss energy conversion systems and sustainability, • Analyze (traditional and alternative) energy conversion systems for efficiency and power transfer, and • Measurably evaluate the sustainability of energy conversion systems.These objectives were explicitly developed with Bloom’s Taxonomy in mind [3,4]. In order topromote higher levels of learning, especially for the latter two objectives, a variety of activitiesthat were developed that embodied different modes of learning. These included: • Connecting energy use to their daily lives via energy audits, • Multiple field trips to local energy conversion facilities, including hydro, photovoltaic, and biomass systems, • Real-world examples and in-class hands-on items such as photovoltaic cells and wind turbine models, • In-class worksheets that cover both specific problems and more open-ended questions, and • [Preferably service learning] projects completed in multi-disciplinary teams.For the purpose of analyzing the course’s impacts in a broader sense, a mix of quantitative andqualitative methods will be used. The first qualitative method will employ concept maps toanalyze written exams and oral presentations, in order to determine the exact areas ofunderstanding, similar to Hill & Plantenberg [5]. These concept maps may then be compared toexperts in the field of energy conversion and/or sustainability depending on the topic. Inaddition, the final exam will be compared to a benchmark quiz from the first week of class.Lastly, a survey will be distributed to the students to gather their perceptions about engineeringand about other disciplines. The survey will also inquire which activities (mentioned above) hadthe greatest impact in which of the objectives and why. Due to the small class size, these will notbe repeatable results. Instead, as stated, a more in-depth approach to assessment will be taken.References[1] "Resource Management," Center for Strategic and International Studies, [Online].

T1  - Preparing Students for the Complexity of the Systems Medicine Field through a Research Experience For Undergraduates (REU)
AN  - 2317745062
AB  - Preparing Students for the Complexity of the Systems Medicine Field through a Research Experience For Undergraduates (REU)Over the next few decades, the total cost of healthcare is anticipated to increase dramatically.Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of healthcare delivery via model-based systemsengineering methods can slow this increase. One method to accomplish this is through theemployment of engineers and scientists that have an understanding of mathematical modeling,biology, and clinical practice and that can see how these fields interact to improve clinicaloutcomes. This field, also known as “systems medicine”, is an area that is currently underservedwithin the undergraduate education community. To address this deficit, an investment of time,resources and opportunities for student research experiences will be necessary if we hope to beable to prepare students for challenges that they will face when embarking in this field.Over the course of the past three years a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU)program has been run at XXXX. This program consisted of students being paired with a mentoron a specific technical project over a ten week period while receiving professional developmentopportunities through a weekly workshop series. The professional development opportunitiesincluded skills that are relevant to engineering or scientific careers such as scientific writing andpresentation skills but also provided students with background on the diverse nature of thesystems medicine field. Students also participated in a local undergraduate research postersession and provided a final presentation on their research results.To determine the effectiveness of the REU program for preparing students for the complexity ofthe systems medicine field, students completed concept maps of their vision of what the systemsmedicine field encompassed both at the start and end of their ten week research experience.Completion of the concept map was done subsequent to a training exercise that was performed tofamiliarize students with concept maps and how they are constructed. Utilizing the IntegratedRubric for Scoring Concept Maps1, it was possible to score the concept maps on the basis ofcomprehensiveness, organization and correctness. Each concept map was scored by twoindividuals and an inter-rater reliability score was calculated. Concept map scores from the endof the REU program were then compared to those from the start of the program to determine ifany significant change in understanding of the complexity of the systems medicine field occurredas result of students’ participation in the REU program.

T1  - Case for Building Informal Ontology of a Subject Matter at School Level Science Education with Community Collaboration
AN  - 1752593732
AB  - School science textbooks are an amalgamation of concepts collected from different fields of Science like Physics, Chemistry and Biology. The actual number of concepts in the different domains of science are enormous. Educationists have to make a decision of choosing some concept that they think are necessary for students to know at a certain age. Moreover, these concepts have to be arranged in a certain order of arrangement from first chapter to the last in a textbook. The aim of this paper is to question the ontological basis of filtering concepts from the larger world of science to placing them in a school science textbook. Through two informal studies presented in this paper, the author has tried to demonstrate that different groups of people can form concept maps of a topic that are very different in structure compared to what is given in NCERT textbook. If there are multiple ways of arranging the same set of concepts, then how do educationist validate one set of arrangement of topics against the other? The result of study puts light on the fact that currently there are no criteria available for judging the ontological validity of concepts that are present in existing textbooks in school science curriculum. The selection of topics is dependent upon limited individual knowledge base of the expert who is writing the chapter. The article briefly provides a framework by which ontology of a subject can be developed collaboratively by a community of teachers and subject matter experts. This ontology can be used as a valid guide for choosing and arranging topics in a school level science textbook.

T1  - Concept Maps in the Classroom: A New Approach to Reveal Students' Conceptual Change
AN  - 1682439589
AB  - When entering the classroom, adolescents already hold various conceptions on science topics. Concept maps may function as useful tools to reveal such conceptions although labor-intensive analysis often prevents application in typical classroom situations. The authors aimed to provide teachers with an appropriate approach to analyze students' concept maps within daily school routine. They intended to conclude qualitative changes from analyzing quantitative parameters. To test the approach, high school students were asked to map their conceptions before and after attending an educational program on climate change. For the analyses, quantitative as well as qualitative methods were applied. A comparison of pre- and postmaps pointed to a conceptual change. From strong correlations between qualitative and quantitative parameters we assumed our approach to be applicable. Due to its simple and barely time-consuming handling, the authors' approach is suitable for application in conventional classroom situations and may contribute to inform teachers about students' conceptions.

T1  - Key Characteristics of Successful Science Learning: The Promise of Learning by Modelling
AN  - 2259586389
AB  - The basic premise underlying this research is that scientific phenomena are best learned by creating an external representation that complies with the complex and dynamic nature of such phenomena. Effective representations are assumed to incorporate three key characteristics: they are graphical, dynamic, and provide a pre-specified outline of the domain. This study examined the impact of these characteristics on performance and learning. High school students first read an instructional text about glucose–insulin regulation and then created a representation of its content. Representations differed regarding the key characteristics such that the summary (n = 15), concept map (n = 16), model (n = 23), and outlined model (n = 21) all incorporated one additional characteristic compared to their precursor. Main results indicated learning effects in each of these four conditions. Furthermore, creating a model was found to enhance students’ learning more than creating a concept map, and students who completed an outlined model were found to learn more than those who created a model from scratch. In conclusion, this study does not univocally verify the necessity of all key characteristics individually, but the results do show that a representational format that combines all key characteristics enhances learning more than other formats.

T1  - Student Learning Outcomes in Response to Concept-Based Teaching
AN  - 1702763414
AB  - Concept-based teaching (CBT) has been found to better facilitate students' meaningful learning than traditional pedagogy, but little research has been conducted in nursing education.              This mixed-methods study investigated meaningful learning in nursing students. Quantitative data were extracted from archived records and analyzed through multiple regression to compare two groups: students who received CBT and students who received traditional teaching.              Students' pretest scores were the best predictor of meaningful learning gain (i.e., difference between pre- and post-test higher order thinking [HOT] scores). No significant between-group differences were noted. Qualitative data were collected from 22 CBT students, purposefully selected for their HOT scores, and analyzed through flow mapping. Integrative analysis found that students who verbalized a greater number of knowledge connections had higher HOT scores and a deeper understanding of nursing principles than did students with lower HOT scores.              CBT students' gain in HOT scores may become more apparent over several semesters.

T1  - What Makes Us Enthusiastic, Angry, Feeling at Rest or Worried? Development and Validation of an Affective Work Events Taxonomy Using Concept Mapping Methodology
AN  - 1658053457
AB  - Affective events theory (AET) highlights the importance of work events as antecedents of distinct emotions, attitudes, and work behavior. However, few attempts have been made to systematically classify positive and negative work events. The aim of this study was to develop a comprehensive taxonomy of affective work events to provide a common frame of reference for future research and to improve communication among researchers regarding research on affective work events.              Positive and negative affective work events were sampled from employees using a diary study design. We used concept mapping methodology as an exploratory approach to analyze the data on affective work events.              Two hundred eighteen employees reported 559 positive and 383 negative affective work events. We identified four positive and seven negative event clusters. Each event cluster showed a unique relationship with distinct affective states, even when controlling for the occurrence of events without clustering and trait affect. The results support the validity of our taxonomy.              This study contributes to previous literature by providing a comprehensive yet parsimonious classification of both positive and negative affective work events. The affective work event clusters found reflect personal values of agency and communion. This classification of affective events as reflecting agentic and communal values provides a starting point for the integration of findings from previous studies.              The taxonomy developed in this study provides an integrative approach and a basis for future research to more differentially investigate relationships proposed by AET.

T1  - Teaching Searching from the Inside Out: Reducing Cognitive Load
AN  - 2869205770
AB  - Introduction: Traditional search methods don't always work. Is there an alternative? Objectives: To offer a new way of teaching database searching, away from the rigidity of PIE and PICO. Teaching how to search, especially in the health sciences, follows a prescribed multi-step framework: students are instructed to create a search using concept maps or PIE or PICO; they assign vocabulary to each concept; and finally they search the database. Students struggle to fit their topics into neat concept boxes or tidy PIEs or PICOs. The perception that databases such as Medline, Embase, or CINAHL are difficult and laborious becomes ingrained. What if teaching database searching were approached from familiar terrain that leverages students' current practices and habits with regard to information seeking? We propose a new framework that would benefit students' experiential learning style as well as reduce the cognitive stress of learning how to search in an academic landscape. Methods: A natural language search in Google would be the first step. Relevant citations found in Google could then be searched in traditional databases and segued into how they were indexed. The use of controlled vocabulary and keywords could then be incorporated into a topic search. Results: Less fear about forcing search terms into prescribed boxes, more confidence by starting with a familiar search engine such as Google. Discussion: Even though health science databases might be rigid and structured, the approach to teaching how to use them need not be.

T1  - Investigating Relationships among Pre-Service Science Teachers’ Conceptual Knowledge of Electric Current, Motivational Beliefs and Self-Regulation
AN  - 2786517669
AB  - Background:
The purpose of this study is to examine relationships among pre-service science teachers’ conceptual knowledge of electric current, motivational beliefs, and self-regulation. One hundred and twenty-seven students (female = 107, male = 20) enrolled in the science education program of a public university in Ankara participated the study.
Materials and methods:
A concept map technique was used to determine students’ conceptual knowledge level of electric current. To determine students’ motivational beliefs and self-regulation, a scale developed by Velayutham, Aldridge, and Fraser (2011) was first translated into Turkish and adapted to Turkish culture and then used as a measurement tool.
Results:
Results showed that students’ motivational beliefs were positively associated with their self-regulation, and students’ task value, self-efficacy, and self-regulation were positively related with students’ conceptual knowledge of electric current.
Conclusions:
These results show that students’ motivational beliefs and self-regulation have important roles in students’ conceptual knowledge level when assessed using concept map technique.

T1  - Knowledge Level Assessment in e-Learning Systems Using Machine Learning and User Activity Analysis
AN  - 2656523400
AB  - Electronic Learning has been one of the foremost trends in education so far. Such importance draws the attention to an important shift in the educational paradigm. Due to the complexity of the evolving paradigm, the prospective dynamics of learning require an evolution of knowledge delivery and evaluation. This research work tries to put in hand a futuristic design of an autonomous and intelligent e-Learning system. In which machine learning and user activity analysis play the role of an automatic evaluator for the knowledge level. It is important to assess the knowledge level in order to adapt content presentation and to have more realistic evaluation of online learners. Several classification algorithms are applied to predict the knowledge level of the learners and the corresponding results are reported. Furthermore, this research proposes a modern design of a dynamic learning environment that goes along the most recent trends in e-Learning. The experimental results illustrate an overall performance superiority of a support vector machine model in evaluating the knowledge levels; having 98.6%of correctly classified instances with 0.0069 mean absolute error.

T1  - Enhancing the Effectiveness of Consumer-Focused Health Information Technology Systems Through eHealth Literacy: A Framework for Understanding Users' Needs
AN  - 2512322752
AB  - Background: eHealth systems and applications are increasingly focused on supporting consumers to directly engage with and use health care services. Involving end users in the design of these systems is critical to ensure a generation of usable and effective eHealth products and systems. Often the end users engaged for these participatory design processes are not actual representatives of the general population, and developers may have limited understanding about how well they might represent the full range of intended users of the eHealth products. As a consequence, resulting information technology (IT) designs may not accommodate the needs, skills, cognitive capacities, and/or contexts of use of the intended broader population of health consumers. This may result in challenges for consumers who use the health IT systems, and could lead to limitations in adoption if the diversity of user attributes has not been adequately considered by health IT designers.
Objective: The objective of this paper is to propose how users’ needs and competences can be taken into account when designing new information and communications technology solutions in health care by expanding the user-task-context matrix model with the domains of a new concept of eHealth literacy.
Methods: This approach expands an existing method for supporting health IT system development, which advocates use of a three-dimensional user-task-context matrix to comprehensively identify the users of health IT systems, and what their needs and requirements are under differing contexts of use. The extension of this model involved including knowledge about users’ competences within the seven domains of eHealth literacy, which had been identified based on systematic engagement with computer scientists, academics, health professionals, and patients recruited from various patient organizations and primary care. A concept map was constructed based on a structured brainstorm procedure, card sorting, and computational analysis.
Results: The new eHealth literacy concept (based on 7 domains) was incorporated as a key factor in expanding the user-task-context matrix to describe and qualify user requirements and understanding related to eHealth literacy. This resulted in an expanded framework and a five-step process, which can support health IT designers in understanding and more accurately addressing end-users’ needs, capabilities, and contexts to improve effectiveness and broader applicability of consumer-focused health IT systems. It is anticipated that the framework will also be useful for policy makers involved in the planning, procuring, and funding of eHealth infrastructure, applications, and services.
Conclusions: Developing effective eHealth products requires complete understanding of the end-users’ needs from multiple perspectives. In this paper, we have proposed and detailed a framework for modeling users’ needs for designing eHealth systems that merges prior work in development of a user-task-context matrix with the emerging area of eHealth literacy. This framework is intended to be used to guide design of eHealth technologies and to make requirements explicitly related to eHealth literacy, enabling a generation of well-targeted, fit-for-purpose, equitable, and effective products and systems.

T1  - Creating visual aids with graphic organisers on an infinite canvas – the impact on the presenter: Association for Learning Technology Journal
AN  - 2121431834
AB  - Instead of the traditional set of slides, the visual aids of a presentation can now be graphic organisers (concept maps, knowledge maps, mind maps) on an infinite canvas. Constructing graphic organisers has a beneficial impact on learning, but this topic has not been studied in the context of giving a presentation. The present study examined this issue by having 199 students prepare a presentation. The control sample created visual aids that are similar to a deck of slides with text and pictures. In the first experimental condition, graphic organisers were inserted in this deck of slides, and in the second experimental condition, visuals aids with interconnected graphic organisers were produced. There were no significant differences in self-reported self-efficacy related to giving a presentation and in motivational variables. To detect if the presentations met the principles set by the conditions, the participants’ products were coded qualitatively, but this analysis also yielded no differences in variables. Further research should therefore explore the interaction between software and presenter.

T1  - Using concept maps to create reasoning models to teach thinking: An application for solving kinematics problems
AN  - 1955094962
AB  - We present research carried out with university students taking the subject “Concept Maps in Teaching” within the Master’s Degree on Research in Teaching and Learning of the Experimental Sciences. The objective of this study was to elaborate a reasoning model, created using concept maps, that captures modes of thinking of expert teachers about solving kinematics problems. This model, used as a framework for those with less expertise in a particular form of argumentation, identifies approaches to solving certain types of problems. This paper focuses on the creation, utilisation, and validation of a reasoning model for solving kinematics problems. This model may apply to other types of learning content (concepts, procedures, but primarily arguments). The study was conducted during a school year with 60 students using a pre-test and post-test method to quantify the effectiveness of the reasoning model developed in problem solving. The statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant difference between the performance of the experimental and control groups. The results suggest that the development and use of this type of meta-reasoning, which is necessary for building a reasoning model, are of great help in teaching our students to reason about kinematics problem solving.

T1  - Suggestions for teacher education from concept mapping studies
AN  - 1955094887
AB  - In order to enhance primary and secondary education, teaching and learning methods need to be continuously developed as well as, of course, promote teaching quality dependent on teacher personality, teacher professional development, teacher self-development, etc. Teacher professional development gives the novice teacher access to a wide set of teaching methods and assessment opportunities, especially geared to flexible learning and assessment methods, which can be considered for adoption. One such flexible method is the use of concept mapping. This article describes the results of several studies, where concept mapping method was used, giving many didactical suggestions for using concept mapping for learning and especially for assessment. Additionally, considerations are introduced on using concept maps as a research instrument.

T1  - Concept maps as versatile tools to integrate complex ideas: From kindergarten to higher and professional education
AN  - 1955093773
AB  - Knowledge is getting increasingly more complex. Learners, from Kindergarten to higher education, require powerful tools to connect complex ideas. This paper explores the range of studies that investigated concept maps as learning, metacognitive, collaborative, and assessment tools to support integrating complex ideas. Research suggests that concept maps can be successfully implemented in a wide variety of settings, from K12 to higher and professional education. However, the effectiveness of concept maps depends on different factors, such as concept map training and choosing a suitable form of concept map to match the task and learner. Developing proficiency in concept mapping takes time and practice and should not be first introduced in higher education. Concept map training could start as early as Kindergarten and include concept map generation, interpretation, and revision. This paper concludes that, if implemented thoughtfully, concept maps can be versatile tools to support knowledge integration processes towards a deeper understanding of the relations and structures of complex ideas and facilitate life-long learning.

T1  - Designing problem-based curricula: The role of concept mapping in scaffolding learning for the health sciences
AN  - 1955093200
AB  - While the utility of concept mapping has been widely reported in primary and secondary educational contexts, its application in the health sciences in higher education has been less frequently noted. Two case studies of the application of concept mapping in undergraduate and postgraduate health sciences are detailed in this paper. The case in undergraduate dental education examines the role of concept mapping in supporting problem-based learning and explores how explicit induction into the principles and practices of CM has add-on benefits to learning in an inquiry-based curriculum. The case in postgraduate medical education described the utility of concept mapping in an online inquiry-based module design. Specific attention is given to applications of CMapTools™ software to support the implementation of Novakian concept mapping in both inquiry-based curricular contexts.

T1  - Creating Independence Through Student-Owned Strategies (Project CRISS): Educator Accounts of the Impact of Project CRISS on Student Learning
AN  - 1789602868
AB  - This mixed-methods study documented the experiences of educators who had used the Project CRISS Program. The program had been implemented since 2001 in Bay District Schools, in Florida. However, educator experiences about the program were not available for future program implementation decisions. Teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators completed a quantitative and qualitative questionnaire about the Project CRISS Program. An analysis of the quantitative data included using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS, Version 22.0). Descriptive statistics were reported and analyzed for the survey items using a Likert-type scale. The constant comparison method was used to analyze the qualitative data. Survey items with short answer responses, as well as comments made on the open-ended questions, were transcribed.   Findings revealed educators’ observations about the Project CRISS Program. Educators observed that prior to implementing Project CRISS, students had experienced difficulty with outlining, note taking, text marking, and highlighting text. Educators observed that after implementing Project CRISS, students increased in their use of content-specific vocabulary, concept mapping for better understanding, and vocabulary to help them elaborate and write in complete sentences. Consequently, students increased their learning confidence as well as competence, and the educators believed that the students assumed more control of their learning. The most frequently implemented Project CRISS strategies were the active strategies of graphic organizers, KWL and KWL+, Venn diagrams, anticipation guides, one-sentence summaries, and picture notes. Educators also observed that students could use 2- and 3- column notes, selective highlighting, and concept maps independently. Recommendations for practice included suggestions for teachers, instructional coaches, and administrators for implementing Project CRISS strategies at the highest level. Future research studies about the Project CRISS program were recommended for Bay District Schools in Florida to provide insights into implementing the program at the highest level.

T1  - Flow Charts to Improve Health Information Exchange in Long-Term Care
AN  - 1758894773
AB  - In February 2009 President Obama signed the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) Act, as a central part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA).  Administered by the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), this act contains specific incentives which are designed to accelerate adoption of health information technology (HIT) by the health care industry, health care providers, consumers, and patients (US Department of Health and Human Services, [(DHHS)], 2014).   According to the ONC, health information exchange (HIE) allows healthcare professionals and patients to electronically access and securely share patients’ medical information.   HIE helps to ensure communication between providers along the healthcare spectrum and foster continuity of care while reducing costs and duplicated work.  Unfortunately, barriers remain to establishing HIE between long-term care facilities and other healthcare providers.  Key functions for HIE include referrals to long-term acute care (LTAC), discharges and transfers from hospitals to  LTAC, and transfers from LTAC to acute care or home and community- based services, (DHHS, 2013).  The most feasible means to provide optimal care for patients in the above care scenarios is communication between all providers from each treating healthcare organization. This project helped healthcare professionals in long-term care facilities optimize HIE at point of care transition.  In this project concept, maps were used as tools to enhance communication between providers in a three care scenarios that was discussed.  A power point presentation was created to educate staff in long-term care facilities on the importance of HIE, and the concept maps themselves. Ultimately, the goal was to provide quality care resulting in better healthcare outcomes by using HIE.

T1  - The impact of structured prebriefing on nursing students' competency performance, clinical judgment and experience in simulation
AN  - 1752401439
AB  - AIM To examine the intervention of structured prebriefing, for its effect on students’ simulation performance and their prebriefing experience. Prebriefing is the introductory phase of the simulation process.    BACKGROUND Despite its inclusion in the simulation process, little research is available on prebriefing. Reflection theory and concept mapping informed a model-based structured prebriefing activity for preparing students for meaningful learning in simulation.    METHOD A group-randomized, experimental study of 76 baccalaureate nursing students compared competency performance, clinical judgment, and the perception of the prebriefing experience of those receiving structured prebriefing, to those receiving traditional prebriefing activities. The relationship between simulation performance and students’ self-rated prebriefing experience was also examined.    RESULTS A statistically significant difference was demonstrated between groups for competency performance (p < .001), clinical judgment (p < .001) and prebriefing experience (p < .001). No relationship was found between perception of prebriefing experience and students’ simulation performance.     CONCLUSION Structured prebriefing may impact nursing student competency performance, clinical judgment and perceptions of prebriefing, and meaningful simulation learning.

T1  - Speech-Language Pathologists on Multicultural Counseling Competency
AN  - 1735793193
AB  - Despite reports of speech-language pathology graduate-level programs focusing on multicultural competence, the literature suggests speech-language pathologists are not adequately educated and trained to be culturally competent. The purpose of this study was to examine the experiences of public school-based speech-language pathologists’ graduate-level academic instruction and the clinical practicum experiences in multicultural competence, specifically in the area of multicultural counseling. Guided by the theory of multicultural counseling and therapy, this study used a phenomenological approach, employing semistructured, in-person interviews with 7 participants. The inclusion criteria used for selecting study participants included: having a master’s degree in speech-language pathology, graduation from an accredited, graduate-level speech-language pathology program, certification by American Speech-Language-Hearing Association, employment as a speech-language pathologist for at least 2 years, and employment within the public school setting for at least 2 years at the time of the study. Concept mapping was used to analyze the participants’ responses which allowed the organization of themes and subthemes that emerged. The analyzed data revealed the 7 participants shared experiences and perceptions in the following 5 themes: (a) the role of clinical practicum supervisors, (b) the approaches used to address multicultural counseling in academic instruction and clinical practicum experiences, (c) the influences in developing cultural competence, (d) feelings of preparedness once in the workplace, and (e) the effect adjustment counseling has on service delivery. The findings of this study support the need for more focus on multicultural competency in the area of multicultural counseling in the academic instruction and clinical practicum experiences of speech-language pathologists programs.

T1  - The Africa Yoga Project: A participant-driven concept map of Kenyan teachers' reported experiences
AN  - 1734642411
AB  - Concept mapping methodology was used to explore the perceived effects of teaching and/or practicing yoga with the Africa Yoga Project (AYP) - a health promotion program that trains and funds Kenyans to teach yoga throughout Kenya. Anecdotal evidence and preliminary qualitative research suggested the AYP meaningfully impacted teachers trained. This study constituted a more in-depth investigation of teachers' experiences. Of the AYP's 72 teachers, 52 and 48 teachers participated in Phases I and II, respectively. Phase I brainstorming resulted in 93 teacher-generated statements about their perceived change. Phase II participants sorted and rated statements in terms of importance. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis of sort data was used to map and group statements into clusters. Based on statistical and interpretive criteria, a 12-cluster solution with the following concepts was identified as the best model of teachers' change: Identity as a Yoga Teacher; Prosocial Development; Existential Possibility; Genuine Positive Regard; Value and Respect for Others (highest importance); Presence, Acceptance and Competence; Service and Trust; Non-judgment and Emotion Regulation (lowest importance); Engagement and Connection; Interpersonal Effectiveness; Psychosocial Functioning; and Physical Competence and Security. Overall, teachers reported positive perceptions of the AYP. Additional research is needed to quantify teachers' change and compare the AYP outcomes to those of other health promotion programs.

T1  - Positive Mental Health: A Concept Mapping Exploration
AN  - 1725782695
AB  - American Indian (AI) people experience higher rates of depressive symptoms, psychological distress, and poor mental health than non-Native Americans.  Despite a 17.1% prevalence of Anishinabe (an indigenous people who live in the Midwest of the United States and Canada) adults living with type 2 diabetes and meeting the PHQ-9 cutoff for depression, half (51.3%) of those surveyed were flourishing according to Keyes’ Mental Health Continuum—Short Form (MHC-SF).  A unique paradox appears to exist for AI people more so than that documented for other groups: despite historical trauma, various social stressors, ongoing marginalization, and depression and chronic diseases, a disproportionately large number of AI people met criteria for flourishing mental health.      In order to better understand Anishinabe concepts of mental wellness and the utility of the MHC in this population, the specific aim of the study was to gain a deeper understanding of indigenous interpretations of positive mental health (PMH) by engaging in a group concept mapping session with Anishinabe community members from two communities.    The resulting concept map varied somewhat from the three aspects of PMH presented in Keyes’ MHC-SF (emotional, psychological, and social wellbeing).  According to the map, PMH included the following clusters: 1) Values Gained with Maturity, 2) Motivated, 3) Traditional Spirituality/Culture, 4) Culturally Competent/Accept Others, 5) Take Care of Self, 6) Financial Health/Organized, 7) Ethical/Moral Leadership, 8) Community, and 9) Family/Relationships.  Many of the clusters were related at least in part to the MHC-SF, but some differences were evident.  Additionally, themes of harmony and balance, resilience and coping, and connection and interconnectedness, while not found in the MHC-SF, were prominent aspects in this concept map, lending support to their importance in indigenous PMH.  Overall, the theme of interconnection is key to understanding the results of the concept map.     The focus of this study fulfilled calls for strengths-based (as opposed to deficit-based) research for indigenous people.  This was significant not only for better understanding Anishinabe perspectives of PMH, but also for understanding the ways in which all groups of people can learn lessons about PMH through cross-cultural research.

T1  - The Influence of Concept Mapping on Reading Comprehension of Iranian English Students Employing Persuasive and Descriptive Texts
AN  - 1661112917
AB  - Reading is considered as one of the complex skills in EFL context. Comprehension is the understanding of what is read. To be able to understand written material, learners need to use congenial strategies and have sufficient vocabulary. The present study intended to investigate the influence of concept mapping on reading comprehension of EFL learners employing persuasive and descriptive texts. A language proficiency test was administered to 70 EFL learners, among whom 52 learners were selected as the participants of the study. They were randomly assigned in four groups: two control groups and two experimental groups. Before any instruction the researcher administered a pre-test. Then, learners in two experimental groups received treatment of concept mapping as reading comprehension texts while learners in two control groups received no treatment of concept mapping. The results of pre test and posttest were analyzed by SPSS soft-ware using one way ANOVA statistical procedure. After analyzing the post-test scores, the results indicated that the learners in two experimental groups outperformed the learners in two control groups in reading comprehension. This study also showed that semantic mapping has different effect across types of texts. Learners who received persuasive text performed well than who received descriptive text.

T1  - Improving Learning With Science and Social Studies Text Using Computer-Based Concept Maps for Students With Disabilities
AN  - 1652188637
AB  - Concept maps have been used to help students with learning disabilities (LD) improve literacy skills and content learning, predominantly in secondary school. However, despite increased access to classroom technology, no previous studies have examined the efficacy of computer-based concept maps to improve learning from informational text for students with LD in elementary school. In this study, we used a concurrent delayed multiple probe design to evaluate the interactive use of computer-based concept maps on content acquisition with science and social studies texts for Hispanic students with LD in Grades 4 and 5. Findings from this study suggest that students improved content knowledge during intervention relative to a traditional instruction baseline condition. Learning outcomes and social validity information are considered to inform recommendations for future research and the feasibility of classroom implementation.

With the first version of this work, Text2MARK, it was possible to obtain representations of database models with over 90% of accuracy. In this continuing work, some grammatical rules of the Portuguese language, called lexical predicates, were constructed, alongside other text mining metrics. With the incorporation of these new elements, Text2MARK was then applied to text sections taken from five scientific articles from different areas of knowledge. 84.2% of valid tuples were extracted and then applied in the construction of concept maps. Subsequently, these maps underwent a subjective evaluation by three different groups of users, who then attributed grades to the maps, ranging from 0 to 10, with means of 8.1, 8.1 and 8.3 per group. These results indicate that it is possible to extract and use tuples in the NAME-VERB-NAME format to represent knowledge by means of concept maps.

T1  - The Effect of Using Concept Mapping on Student's Attitude and Achievement When Learning the Physics Topic of Circular and Rotational Motion
AN  - 1807493531
AB  - The study was conducted to show the effectiveness of concept mapping as a teaching strategy to undergraduate students taking introductory physics course. A number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of concept mapping on student academic achievement. The main focus of these studies have been on comparing the effectiveness of concept mapping to traditional teaching practices such as the lecture method. This research, however, compares concept mapping to tutorial sheets strategy in teaching circular and rotational motion.  A sample of 70 students participated in the experiment. An equivalent number of 35 students were assigned to the control and experimental group. The control group used tutorial sheets while the experimental group used concept mapping. A pre-test and post-test was administered to the two groups. A t-test was used to compare the means of the group's test scores.  The mean score for the experimental group's post test was higher than the mean score of the control group.  This showed that concept mapping was more effective than the tutorial sheet strategy. Questionnaires and interviews were also used to determine the attitude of students towards concept mapping. The findings showed that students had a positive attitude towards the use of concept mapping.

T1  - A new hybrid approach for constructing the concept map based on fuzzy prerequisite relationships

In recent years, adaptive learning systems rely increasingly on concept maps to customize the educational logic developed in their courses. Most approaches do not take into account the possibility of combining the concept maps predefined by experts of field and those developed automatically using the Fuzzy Sets Theory. In this article, we present a hybrid approach using on the one hand the feedback from experts of domain to select, prioritize relevant concepts and create prerequisite relationships to get the initial concept map, on the other hand we use the fuzzy logic to measure relevance degree of all relationships existing in this concept map, these links are considered as fuzzy relationships. With this approach we got two types of prerequisite relationships between concepts, the first type can be classified as relationships correctly established by the expert. These relationships must be kept in the final concept map. The second type can be considered as relationships incorrectly established by the expert, because the concepts involved in these relationships are independent, in this case these relations must be deleted or substituted with the inverse of the original relations, or because the items used in evaluations of these concepts are inappropriate and must be reviewed.

T1  - A Concept Mapping Study on Social Inclusion in Hong Kong
AN  - 1560339475
AB  - A focus group study involving concept mapping was conducted in September 2012 to investigate how the concept of social inclusion was understood by Hong Kong residents. It was a replication of an earlier UK study. Seven groups involving 61 participants (38 females; 23 males) were interviewed, including non-professional workers at a Non-government Organisation service, senior centre users, a mixed group of community residents, people with severe mental illness, professional social service providers, communication studies students, and social work students. Data analysis using Nvivo 10 and systematic thematic analysis identified six major themes including: (1) material resources and wealth, (2) work, (3) social (dis)harmony and diversity, (4) discrimination, (5) communication, and (6) participation in activities. An overall final model of Social Inclusion for Hong Kong based on concept maps for all seven groups is presented. The results will inform the conceptualisation and development of a Chinese-language measure of social inclusion (SCOPE-C) based on translation and cultural adaption of the Social and Community Opportunities Profile (SCOPE) developed in UK.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Triatominae biochemistry goes to school: Evaluation of a novel tool for teaching basic biochemical concepts of chagas disease vectors
AN  - 1546195803; 24687369
AB  - We evaluate a new approach to teaching the basic biochemistry mechanisms that regulate the biology of Triatominae, major vectors of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease. We have designed and used a comic book, "Carlos Chagas: 100 years after a hero's discovery" containing scientific information obtained by seven distinguished contemporary Brazilian researchers working with Triatominaes. Students (22) in the seventh grade of a public elementary school received the comic book. The study was then followed up by the use of Concept Maps elaborated by the students. Six Concept Maps elaborated by the students before the introduction of the comic book received an average score of 7. Scores rose to an average of 45 after the introduction of the comic book. This result suggests that a more attractive content can greatly improve the knowledge and conceptual understanding among students not previously exposed to insect biochemistry. In conclusion, this study illustrates an alternative to current strategies of teaching about the transmission of neglected diseases. It also promotes the diffusion of the scientific knowledge produced by Brazilian researchers that may stimulate students to choose a scientific career.Copyright © 2014 by The International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, 42(4):323-330, 2014.

T1  - Use of Concept Maps to Assess Student Sustainability Knowledge
AN  - 2317705715
AB  - Assessment of Student Sustainability Knowledge using Concept Maps As the global landscape continues to evolve, engineers will be required to adapt their skills and professionalpractices to meet the needs of present and future generations. As a result, it is imperative that engineering educatorsstrive to equip their students with the knowledge necessary to act as sustainability-conscious engineers. Accuratesustainability knowledge assessments can aid in this endeavor by informing the design and evaluating theeffectiveness of efforts to infuse sustainability content into undergraduate courses and curricula. A study was conducted to demonstrate the efficacy of using concept maps (cmaps) to examine studentsustainability knowledge. Specifically, seniors enrolled in a Civil and Environmental Engineering (CEE) capstonedesign course at the Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech) participated in a concept mapping workshopwhere they completed cmaps on the focus question: “What is sustainability?” Cmaps were analyzed using threedifferent scoring approaches found in the literature: the traditional method, the holistic method, and the categoricalmethod. Results indicated that inter-rater reliability, based on Krippendorff’s alpha, was acceptable for all threescoring approaches. For CEE at GT, these results support the need for educational interventions to guide students indeveloping sustainability knowledge networks that are balanced (in breadth and depth) and interconnected. Broadly,this study elucidates for engineering educators how to administer and score cmaps as sustainability knowledgeassessments.

T1  - The iCollaborate MSE Project: Progress Update 2014
AN  - 2317704647
AB  - The iCollaborate MSE Project: Progress Update 2014AbstractThe iCollaborate Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) project is a multiyear,multifaceted research project designed to understand how student learning outcomes,student engagement, and successful course completion rates in introductory MSE coursesare affected by a variety of programs and activities that are based upon best practicesfrom STEM education research. A number of interventions and active techniques wereused in the classroom, at first, singularly, and, as the project progressed, in variouscombinations. Additionally, a wide variety of faculty and student resources were createdas part of this project. For example, test device MSE iPod applications were developedfor iCollaborate: Concept Questions, Vocabulary, Basic Knowledge, Tune-Up, MaterialProperties, Composite Calculator, MSE Convert, and MSE Knowledge Tools andReview. Furthermore, a concept map based web site, which includes web applications ofmany of the iPod applications is currently under construction. Initially, the overallpurpose of the website was envisioned as a repository of project resources, but as theproject proceeded, it became obvious that the students perceived the concept map andweb tools as essential parts of the project and their view of their personal successstrategies.Overall, the basic principles implemented in the project are supported by theory based incognitive and social constructivism; and, the substantial body of evidence that favorscollaborative learning and the inductive approach over the traditional lecture driven,deductive teaching approach. Collaborative learning, active/inquiry learning, conceptlearning, peer learning, problem/case-based learning, low stakes quizzing, mini-lectureswith just-in-time reading, collaborate research writing, and constructive alignment are allpart of the project. The developed iCollaborate learning exercises are conceptuallytargeted, designed to provide scaffolds to prior knowledge, and are active, inquiry basedmodules. Not surprisingly, we found that students come to the course with differentlevels of preparation, and that scores in pre-requisite courses do matter, but are notalways perfect indicators that key information from those courses was retained. Studentsenter the course with a wide range of learning styles, and some pre-requisite informationis retained or learned differently based on individual learning styles (as measured by ourassessments). Based on our findings, we recommend that every instructor evaluate thepre-requisite knowledge of their students and complete targeted interventions aimed atknown robust misconceptions and local knowledge gaps. Overall, the students were ableto understand the relationships between the collaborative assignments, the low stakesquizzes, and the mini-lectures in helping them learn different types of concepts.This paper concentrates on previously unreported components of the iCollaborate projectthat were investigated, evaluated, or developed during the 2012-2013 academic year. Thedevelopment of the iCollaborate concept map and web applications web site isemphasized in this paper. The paper concludes with a summary of findings thus far fromthe project and a discussion of future directions and research opportunities. The plans forthe final year of the project will be discussed.  The National Science Foundation is supporting the project (NSF CCLI/TUES#XXXXX).

T1  - Utilizing Concept Maps to Improve Engineering Course Curriculum in Teaching Mechanics
AN  - 2317704437
AB  - Utilizing Concept Maps to Improve Engineering Course Curriculum in Teaching MechanicsOne of the most difficult tasks of teaching in a college environment is evaluating how studentsassimilate the content. Tests and homework only show so much, as the performance on thoseevaluations may be a stronger indication of how much effort each student is putting into thecourse. In addition, large classes and the relative lack of communication with students make itdifficult to know exactly how students are learning course material. One approach is to havestudents create concept maps once they have finished the course (Turns, 2000). A concept mapis essentially a mental web of connected terms or topics, where the centermost term is theprimary learning focus and lines are used to connect related concepts. This results in a web ofinterconnected concepts that reflect the way students assimilate the new information.The three main questions guiding this study are: 1) How can we decode the variety of ideas andstructures that students include in their concept maps? 2) How can we use these discoveries tomake lectures and labs more effective? 3) What changes can be made to the way students aregiven the concept map development assignment to further increase the usefulness of conceptmaps?The dataset for this study focuses on concept maps developed by undergraduate students –primarily freshmen and sophomores – enrolled in an introductory solid mechanics course takenby many prospective engineering majors throughout the 2013 school year. In the final week ofthe course, students were tasked with creating a concept map of the various terms and topic areascovered during the ten-week course. In analyzing these maps, terms were weighted based ontheir location in reference to the centermost term of the map. Information regarding theproximity of the terms to each other and which terms are connected was also drawn from theconcept map dataset.This first round of analysis indicates that students, for the most part, were drawing the expectedconnections between the different terms and topics. However, there were instances wherestudents isolated topics, missed topics, or had them wrongly associated. This suggests that itmay be beneficial for the teaching team to more explicitly or repeatedly connect certain topicsthroughout the course in lectures, class exercises and homework assignments. Suggestions forimproving the concept map assignment are also discussed.ReferencesTurns, J. (2000).

T1  - Infusing Engineering Concepts into Science: Findings from a Professional Development Project (Research to Practice)
AN  - 2317700783
AB  - Infusing Engineering Concepts into Science: Findings from a Pilot Test Professional Development Project (Research to Practice)This paper describes the findings from a pilot test of a two year professional developmentprogram focused on infusing engineering into biology and physics at the secondary level. Thisproject was funded by the National Science Foundation to research teacher learning through aninnovative approach to professional development that is engineering concept-driven. This isparticularly timely with the recent publication of the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS)and the inclusion of an engineering dimension in science. The project research team has beeninvestigating how to infuse engineering concepts into science given the time, resource, andcurricular constraints of school environments. Specific implementation issues have beenidentified as important as teachers incorporate engineering concepts into their instruction.Twenty-one teachers were involved in the pilot phase of the program. Two separate, but closelyrelated, professional development programs were conducted, one for physics teachers and theother for biology teachers. During the first year, 11 teachers participated in the physics programand 10 in the biology program. In the second year, all 11 of the physics teachers returned and 7of the biology teachers returned. The professional development program involved the teachers ina series of summer institutes and school year activities for two years. During the summerinstitutes, teachers were engaged in three major types of activities, including (a) conceptualdevelopment, (b) curriculum infusion, and (c) classroom preparation. The teachers engaged inactivities designed to build their conceptual understanding of engineering, including case studyanalysis, historical reviews, concept mapping, and engagement with engineering design analysisactivities. Curriculum infusion activities included revising existing curriculum modules anddeveloping engineering infused lessons. Finally, classroom preparation activities focused onapplying the lessons learned in the summer institutes to their classrooms. The primary activitythat occurred for the teachers during the school year between the two summer institutes was thedelivery of the concept-infused lessons to students. In preparation for this process, the summerinstitute included reflection on the pedagogical knowledge, skills, techniques, and challengesassociated with developing and implementing engineering infused lessons.Utilizing a mixed method research design, the project has deployed an iterative process includingdata collection and analysis protocols and designing a set of professional development activities.Specifically, the project has focused on several research and education activities including: (a)refining the conceptual base of engineering for secondary level learning, (b) preparing a set ofprofessional development activities that will develop teachers’ understanding of engineeringconcepts and engage the teachers in a process of curriculum concept infusion, and (c) developingthe instrumentation to collect data on the teachers’ understandings of the engineering conceptsand how this impacts their teaching. Evaluation data collected through teacher surveys,interviews, and training and classroom observations have also informed the process. This paperhighlights the findings from the pilot test cohort including the key issues involved with infusingengineering concepts into physics and biology.

T1  - Methods for Assessing Epistemic Identities: Student Representations of Design and Engineering Practice
AN  - 2317700331
AB  - Methods  for  Assessing  Epistemic  Identities:   Student  Representations  of  Design  and  Engineering  Practice   (Paper Type: Research) Traditionally, engineering design is taught as a tool for synthesis and integration ofengineering content knowledge for students in capstone courses. These engineering designcourses are usually successful, in that the students do well, they come up with innovativesolutions, and they are satisfied with their school experience and feel ready for the real world.But, what is the evidence that students have actually learned and can apply their design andengineering learning successfully for synthesis and integration? What are the student’s ownunderstandings of the design process and engineering design practice? How might they conceiveof their own engineering and design epistemic identities? This work investigates these questions. Evidence of how design and engineering activities change over time as well as how first-year Master’s students in Mechanical Engineering conceptualize design and engineering willcome from a project-based learning design course. Students were queried at the beginning,middle and end of the course for 1) concept map of their typical design process, and 2)representations of what a designer and an engineer do at work, and 3) conceptions of engineeringand design. Items were given out in survey form and participants answered questions by hand.Approximately 30 questionnaires were collected at each stage. Students were asked to draw their “typical design process.” Models of design areprevalent in textbooks and literature. Once in action though, design practitioners often synthesizeand adapt their own experiences and learning into a mental model of their design process. Studyof novice and expert designers have generated insight into these. By asking students to drawtheir typical design process it was hoped that the authors could approximate the students’ mentalmodel. For many years researchers have used the Draw-A-Scientist Test to get at students’perceptions of that field. Based on recent work developing a Draw-an-Engineer Test this paperextends the subject areas to include designers and engineers. Students were asked to draw adesigner and to draw an engineer at work and define the tasks and roles that designers andengineers undertake. Their representations of design and engineering were coded according tokey words in their descriptions and items shown in the drawing. Initial findings from qualitative content analysis indicate that the concept maps of designprocess mature over time along a consistent learning trajectory. Students also have distinct butcomplimentary models of the roles of a designer and engineer along two emerging themes: ideageneration vs. idea implementation and human-centered design vs. technology-centered. Thiswork highlights some paired examples of student drawings along with an assessment of theconcept maps of their design process before and after a class experience. It is insightful to get atstudents conceptualizations and perceptions of design. Do perceptions change over time? Is this afeasible way to get at students’ understandings? It is hoped that this analysis can influence howstudents are taught and assessed.

With the prevalence of web-based learning, the application of concept mapping, as a powerful diagnostic and instructional tool, has been widely exploited in both education and computer science. In recent years, several methods have been presented to automatically construct concept map that achieved encouraging results, while ignoring some critical issues when applied in actual E-learning system. In this paper, we propose a practical approach for constructing concept map, which is adapted to the dynamic character of a real system. Moreover, we apply fuzzy set theory and fuzzy reasoning basis on fuzzy rules for similarity degree between two concepts, to find direct prerequisite relationship among concepts. It provides a useful way to improve accuracy and reduce complexity of the concept map.

T1  - Techtalk: Mobile Apps for Disciplinary Literacy in Science
AN  - 1635068286
AB  - Mobile learning has the ability to engage students in creative, collaborative, and meaningful learning experiences (Cobcroft, Towers, & Smith, 2006) and can enhance student learning (Rossing, Miller, Cecil, & Stamper, 2012) while also being highly accessible through low-cost educational platforms.  In sum, if students learn the reading, writing, vocabulary skills, and learning strategies currently taught in many developmental education classrooms along with specific disciplinary practices which have been found to be an important consideration for student engagement in learning (Hull & Moje, 2012), they can be more successful in college beyond DE courses.

T1  - COMPARISON OF GENERATING CONCEPT MAPS AND USING CONCEPT MAPS ON STUDENTS ACHIEVEMENT
AN  - 1534136936
AB  - Concept mapping is widely used to facilitate learning tool to help students organize information, improve long-term retention and increases student achievement. Student generated concept maps have been recommended for studying content area materials, because the learner plays an active role in creating and modifying the concept map. It is an important classroom pedagogy that promotes development of self-learning. This study aims to compare the effect of concept maps between construct-by-self, construct-on-scaffold and construct by paper-and-pencil on students' comprehension in electricity. Forty-seven high school students were evaluated by a pre-post-test design. Four tenth grade science classes of students at a high school were assigned to three treatment groups. Assessment tests focused on whether the student has acquired the knowledge that is a part of the objectives using concept maps, but also find out what the students knows, understands, or is able to achieve on his own. Group I, individually concept mapped which was used to track their understanding of electricity. Group II, those who used fill in the blank concept map, within which some nodes and links were set as blanks for the scaffold. Group III, construct by paper-and-pencil with the assistance of the feedback. The findings revealed that fill in the blank concept maps on computers positively influenced concept learning compared to those who used individually generating concept maps. The two computer-based procedures are helpful for students in completing their concept maps than constructing with paper-and-pencil. According to interview all students were agreed that concept maps were practical method to determine relationships among concepts, sharpened their conceptual understandings and increased their critical thinking.

T1  - Mindtool-Assisted In-Field Learning (MAIL): An Advanced Ubiquitous Learning Project in Taiwan
AN  - 1528873338
AB  - Scholars have identified that learning in an authentic environment with quality contextual and procedural supports can engage students in thorough observations and knowledge construction. Moreover, the target is that students are able to experience and make sense of all of the learning activities in the real-world environment with meaningful supports, such that their learning motivation can be promoted, knowledge can be sensibly constructed, and skills can be fully developed. To develop potential tutoring strategies and learning activity models using mobile, wireless, and sensing information and communication technologies (ICT) in a real-world learning environment, a four-year national e-learning research project entitled “Mindtool-Assisted In-field Learning (MAIL)” has been funded by the National Science Council of Taiwan since 2008 in an effort to lead the development and innovation of Learning Technology. The integrated project aimed to develop Mindtool-assisted knowledge construction models, assessment models, guidance models, and reflection strategies for cutting-edge context-aware ubiquitous learning. Moreover, a series of learning activities has been conducted to examine the effectiveness of the proposed learning strategies and models. Each year, more than 1,500 students have participated in the in-field learning activities with the designed approaches. Based on the results of a series of experiments, it was found that the students’ learning performance as well as their in-field inquiry ability was significantly improved, showing the effectiveness of the Mindtool-assisted ubiquitous learning approach and the success of the MAIL project. In this paper, the background, objectives, theoretical foundations, systems, research issues, applications, and findings of the MAIL project are presented. Finally, the scaling-up plan for applying these research-proven learning models to all levels of educational settings in Taiwan is also addressed.

T1  - Unpacking the Meaning of the Mole Concept for Secondary School Teachers and Students
AN  - 1509212833
AB  - The "mole" is a fundamental concept in quantitative chemistry, yet research has shown that the mole is one of the most perplexing concepts in the teaching and learning of chemistry. This paper provides a survey of the relevant literature, identifies the necessary components of a sound understanding of the mole concept, and unpacks and presents these components in the form of a concept map. The concept map incorporates the atomic-molecular concept with the mole concept, and connects the two concepts by two linking ideas: the number aspect of the SI definition (linking idea 1) and the connection between relative atomic-molecular mass and molar mass (linking idea 2). This concept map not only provides a conceptual framework for making meaning in relation to the mole but also sheds some light on how the concept might be better taught and learned.

T1  - What do Pre-Service Physics Teachers Know and Think about Concept Mapping
AN  - 2786528402
AB  - In order to use concept maps in physics classes effectively, teachers’ knowledge and ideas about concept mapping are as important as the physics knowledge used in mapping. For this reason, we aimed to examine pre-service physics teachers’ knowledge on concept mapping, their ideas about the implementation of concept mapping in physics classes, the hidden elements influencing their ideas, and the relations between knowledge and ideas, qualitatively. The participants of this study were eight pre-service physics teachers enrolled in the physics education department at two state universities. The results of the interviews conducted with the participants and their artifacts revealed that although pre-service physics teachers had basic knowledge about concept mapping, they had some negative ideas about implementation in physics classes. Furthermore, language, limitation in assessment, limitation in expressions, and teacher’s knowledge were identified as the sources of pre-service physics teachers’ negative ideas.

T1  - Using a Concept Map for Collaborative Learning in Visual Culture Education: Experiences in an Undergraduate Visual Culture Course in Turkey
AN  - 2729536383
AB  - Concept maps have been used individually to process thoughts and document knowledge in the educational sciences for years. This paper describes the usage of a concept map as an advance organizer and discussion aid for a group of 7th semester art education students. By collaboratively developing a concept map as an interactive installation over the course of multiple weeks, students are able to find and illustrate connections between wide-ranging topics covered in an introductory visual culture course. After individually researching topic areas, the group discusses and links them in the atelier. In addition to named connections between the concepts, works of art and media clippings are used to illustrate ideas. The installation serves as a motivational exercise for the students, benefits from their skills in visual expression, and can be exhibited at the end of the course as a collaboratively created work of art. While the process is easier to supervise and review when compared to written homework assignments, character differences between students lead to varying levels of participation. Students enjoyed the approach and plan to include it in their future practice as art educators, creating a need for development of best practices related to concept mapping in art education.

T1  - Using Concept Mapping For Assessment In Science Education
AN  - 2343758786
AB  - Conceptual acquisition is an important aspect of science education, especially with regard to committing things to long term memory. Three case studies were carried out to examine approaches to conceptual acquisition in science education. The aim of these studies was to determine whether concept mapping method is a valid research method. To answer the question, studies were developed. Two of them used animation to describe abstract topics in chemistry. The aim of the third study was to compare the differences in higher taxonomy concept maps, created in an allocated timeframe. The findings of the studies indicate that the use of voiced interactive animation without teacher explanation does not lend itself to superior concept acquisition. As a result of the study it was concluded that concept mapping as an assessment method provides a unique possibility to visualize the structure of students’ conceptual achievements. Based on the outcomes it is recommended concept mapping should be used more as an assessment or research method.

T1  - Teacher Educators’ Views Of “model” Concept And Their Mental Models
AN  - 2343758619
AB  - The aim of this study is to reveal teacher educators’ views of model and also to determine their mental models about it. Phenomenographic research design has been carried out in this study. The sample of study consists of 14 teacher educators from education faculties of different universities in Turkey. Semi-structured interviews that consisted of 7 questions were used to collect data. Besides, sample was asked draw a concept map on “model” in the last interview question. Results have shown that teacher educators give similar responses including unqualified explanations to the interview questions related to the definition of model, characteristics of them, and the objectives of using models. It can also be asserted, that teacher educators do not have scientific understanding on the modeling process. The analyses of their responses to the interview questions and their concept maps have shown that most of the teacher educators in the sample have proximate or goal oriented mental models of the “model”. Considering the results, it is suggested that teacher educators should not only follow the new theories, methods, or the applications in related literature theoretically, but also employ different theories, methods, or applications such as models and modeling in their courses.

T1  - Survey Of High School Students’ Understanding Of Oxidation-Reduction Reaction
AN  - 2343758073
AB  - This study investigated the conceptions of 340 Taiwanese high school students (grades 10 to 12) regarding oxidation–reduction reactions. The diagnostic tool used was a two-tier test based on a concept map of redox reactions as presented in high school curriculums. The reliability of the two-tier test items was 0.82. The results show that most 11th graders performed equally well in questions related to the concept of the gain and loss of electrons during oxidation–reduction. In terms of working with oxidation numbers, scores increased with grade level. The results of this study provide valuable reference for curriculum designers and science instructors.

T1  - Conservation engineering outreach: Curriculum development and evaluation of Smart Fishing in the Bering Sea
AN  - 1647758290
AB  - The purpose of this project to was to 1) develop, 2) instruct, 3) evaluate, and   4) revise a 5th-12th grade fisheries conservation engineering outreach program entitled Smart Fishing and the Bering Sea (SFBS).   Fishery resources are important to Alaska and Alaskans, but present complex conservation challenges including user conflicts and concerns about unsustainable fishing practices. Increasing Alaska residents' environmental literacy will enhance natural resource management decisions regarding fisheries.   The intent of the SFBS program is to introduce students to ecological and economical factors that drive conservation engineering in the Bering Sea pollock fishery.  I instructed the SFBS program to 93 students from four different public and private institutions in Anchorage, Alaska.  My observations and participants' pre- and post-program concept maps were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the SFBS curriculum. Participants gained content knowledge from this fishery outreach program about the Bering Sea and commercial fishing.  Program evaluation analysis and results were used to revise the curriculum and make suggestions to SFBS stakeholders.

T1  - New web-based applications for mechanistic case diagramming
AN  - 1629449806
AB  - The goal of mechanistic case diagraming (MCD) is to provide students with more in-depth understanding of cause and effect relationships and basic mechanistic pathways in medicine. This will enable them to better explain how observed clinical findings develop from preceding pathogenic and pathophysiological events. The pedagogic function of MCD is in relating risk factors, disease entities and morphology, signs and symptoms, and test and procedure findings in a specific case scenario with etiologic pathogenic and pathophysiological sequences within a flow diagram. In this paper, we describe the addition of automation and predetermined lists to further develop the original concept of MCD as described by Engelberg in 1992 and Guerrero in 2001. We demonstrate that with these modifications, MCD is effective and efficient in small group case-based teaching for second-year medical students (ratings of ~3.4 on a 4.0 scale). There was also a significant correlation with other measures of competency, with a 'true' score correlation of 0.54. A traditional calculation of reliability showed promising results (α =0.47) within a low stakes, ungraded environment. Further, we have demonstrated MCD's potential for use in independent learning and TBL. Future studies are needed to evaluate MCD's potential for use in medium stakes assessment or self-paced independent learning and assessment. MCD may be especially relevant in returning students to the application of basic medical science mechanisms in the clinical years.

T1  - Identification of School Physical Activity Leader Competencies Using Concept Mapping
AN  - 1617534221
AB  - Background/Purpose: Various public health and educational organizations have called for the implementation of comprehensive approaches at the state, district, and school levels to promote physical education and physical activity among children and adolescents. Proponents have argued that physical education teachers are positioned to assume the role of director of physical activity in the school setting; however many physical educators do not see directing comprehensive school physical activity programs (CSPAP) as their responsibility, nor have they been formally trained to provide this measure of leadership.  Furthermore, there is limited research on CSPAPs and the associated leadership roles integral to planning, implementing, managing, and evaluating change in this area. The purpose of this exploratory study was to identify the knowledge, skills, and behavioral competencies that a school leader would need to develop in order to implement and sustain a CSPAP.       Method: Researchers used an integrated approach to concept mapping that involved brainstorming, statement analysis and synthesis, sorting and rating of ideas, multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis, and development and interpretation of multiple graphic organizers. These steps were delivered in sequential phases using a web-based communication platform: anonymous brainstorming (n=51), sorting and rating of ideas by key stakeholders ( n=18), and interpretation of maps through semi-structured interviews (n=3). The participants across all phases included K-12 physical educators, school administrators, and higher education researchers identified through systematic review of the literature and snowball sampling.    Analysis/Results: Data aggregation and analysis were completed using multi-dimensional scaling and cluster analysis to determine relationships among brainstormed statements. A variety of maps were developed to graphically display these relationships. Five primary clusters of ideas were identified: (1) Teambuilding and Facilitating, (2) Capacity Building, (3) Knowledge of Instructional Practices, (4) Content Knowledge, and (5) Program Development and Management. Data from the semi-structured interviews were analyzed inductively and used to verify results, determine final cluster names, and identify possible implications for teacher preparation.    Conclusions: The findings support the need for the development of transformational leaders in schools who are capable of empowering others through modification of the work environment, facilitating intrinsic motivation among colleagues, and supplying necessary resources. Teacher education and educational leadership programs have an opportunity to help develop transformational leaders in the area of school physical activity by modifying curricula to provide opportunities for pre-service and in-service teachers to develop the knowledge, skills and behaviors pre-requisite to the implementation and maintenance of CSPAPs within school environments.

T1  - Development of a concept exploration based teaching methodology for undergraduate chemistry education
AN  - 1613217276
AB  - Science in general has traditionally been noted as a difficult subject because of its specialized language, mathematical and abstract concepts, and the amount of content to be learned in a semester. In particular, students are believed to base their attitudes towards science-related disciplines on their perceived abilities in understanding or succeeding in a course. Other factors may also contribute to this lack of interest, such as students' metacognitive skills. Concept mapping and computer-aided tools may be used to assist students in building hierarchical knowledge bases that allow them to visually represent connections between concepts. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to compare the effects of students using alternative learning aids (concept maps, ontology) to traditional learning aids used in an introductory chemistry course.     This study consisted of three phases of implementation (control, treatment 1, and treatment 2 groups) over a three semester period. Phase 1 consisted of the control group, phase 2 consisted of the first treatment group with the addition of the four concept mapping homework assignments in the curriculum and phase 3 consisted of the second treatment group with the integration of the same four concept mapping assignments as phase 2 with the addition of using the Creonto "Intro Chemistry" ontology software.     Students in all three phases were assessed using standardized examination questions that were based on the four concept mapping topics and pre- and post-surveys administered at the beginning and end of the semester. Students in phase 2 and 3 groups were also assessed from their constructed concept maps to measure their abilities to explain connections between key concepts.     The results of this study suggest that students who created concept maps using the Creonto "Intro Chemistry" software performed better on exams and were able to make more connections when creating concept maps compared to students who did not create concept maps or use computers to assist them. For the exams, there was a statistically significant difference between treatment groups' exams 1 and 3 mean scores. For the concept maps, there was a statistically significant difference in students' abilities to explain connections between key concepts. There was no statistically significant difference in attitudes toward chemistry between groups in this study. However, there was a significant statistical difference in metacognitive skills between the groups. More research is needed to gain a better insight into factors that might have affected students in the course.

T1  - Educative Experience of the Use of Concept Mapping in Science and Environmental Teacher Training Programmes
AN  - 1563868145
AB  - Environmental education in the 21 century requires well-instructed teachers with teaching and communication abilities. This paper presents an educational experience developed in several biology and environmental teacher training courses and focused on the treatment of environmental education as a transversal educational topic. For that aim, text analysis techniques, concept mapping and informatics tools have been used to represent individual and collaborative knowledge about environmental topics. 69 students participated in the research. Data about the educational activities developed by the participants have been collected. Furthermore, students have expressed their opinions on the formative process by means of an opinion survey. The outcomes of this study reveal that future teachers and environmental educators consider that concept mapping is a valuable tool to represent their knowledge about environmental education, to encourage reflexive and collaborative learning, to improve teaching communicative abilities and to use effectively ICT in the classroom.

T1  - Evaluation of Growing Strong Bodies and Minds: A literacy-based nutrition education curriculum for young children
AN  - 1562505002
AB  - Growing Strong Bodies and Minds curriculum is a nutrition education program for pre-kindergarten through second grade children that integrates nutrition messages into literacy curriculum (Hildebrand et al., 2009). While the curriculum meets the needs of classroom teachers in teaching core literacy competencies it has not been evaluated for effectiveness in increasing knowledge of food groups in this young age group. Concept mapping has been used in assessing students' learning without requiring the student to read or write. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of Growing Strong Bodies and Minds curriculum to increase knowledge of food groups in pre-kindergarten through second grade. Trained teachers and student teachers in a rural area elementary school taught the curriculum and assessed learning with concept maps.   Six classrooms consisting of 149 children divided into 39 groups participated in the study. Teachers completed concept maps with each group asking what types of foods students would choose for lunch before and after teaching the curriculum. Hierarchical Structure Scores (HSS) were calculated by adding depth and width of each map. A change variable for depth, width, and HSS was computed by subtracting the pre from post score. Differences in change scores were assessed using a repeated measures ANOVA and Tukey post hoc. A paired sample t-test was conducted to compare pre and post depth, width and HSS within each grade. A Wilcoxon Signed Rank non-parametric analysis was also conducted. The ANOVA indicated a difference in depth with first grade being significantly different from pre-kindergarten and second grade. The paired sample t-test and Wilcoxon Signed Rank tests confirmed the increase in first grade depth scores. However, mean depth changes in pre-kindergarten, kindergarten, and second grade were not significant. Furthermore, mean width changes and mean HSS changes for all grades were not significant. Further research is needed to understand why knowledge changes occurred in the first grade but not in any other grade.

AB  - Despite the literature supporting formative testing, most college professors viewed testing only as summative, a means of assigning grades, and believed that an emphasis on summative testing obscured the promotion of learning, which resulted in the use of testing less frequently or sometimes never. The problem was that financial accounting instructors did not know whether a course curriculum that included summative testing, multiple-choice quizzes or short-answer quizzes, or a curriculum that did not include summative testing would enhance student learning of first-year financial accounting information.  A study to test the effects of different forms of summative testing on student achievement in first-year financial accounting courses was conducted using data collected from 45 non-randomly selected and conveniently available participants, a convenience sample, comprised of students enrolled in first-year Financial Accounting courses.  To answer the research questions, a quasi-experimental, between-subject and repeated measures research design was employed.  A quantitative research method was necessary for the proposed study because an examination of the relationship between different forms of frequent summative testing and student achievement in first-year financial accounting courses using mid-term and final exam scores was desired.  The data was examined using a mixed-design ANOVA and revealed that the main effect of group (treatment) was significant,  F(2, 42) = 9.054, p < .05, meaning that the scores were different across the treatment groups.  The pairwise comparisons indicated that the group receiving no quiz treatment achieved significantly different exam scores than the group receiving the multiple-choice treatment,  p = .001.  The data supported the use of frequent testing, multiple-choice quizzes, to enhance student learning of accounting information.  Frequent testing should begin early in the course in order to encourage early and continuous benefits from the testing effect.  Instructors should utilize quiz questions that are similar but not exactly the same as the mid-term and final exam questions to promote transfer, the use of learned material to solve novel problems.  Further research is needed to establish whether second, third, and fourth-year accounting students benefit from frequent testing.  A study investigating the effects of frequent testing on student achievement in online versus residential accounting courses would also be beneficial.

T1  - Content-based curriculum versus concept-based curriculum: A retrospective causal comparative study to identify impact on the development of critical thinking
AN  - 1556660780
AB  - The focus of this causal comparative research was the level of development of critical thinking among associate degree nursing students in an adult medical-surgical course who received concept-based curriculum as compared to students who had received the traditional content-based curriculum. There is evidence that both content-based and concept-based curricula serve to accomplish the same results on the National Council of Licensure Examination (NCLEX) for registered nurses, today's registered nurse graduate is required to have developed critical thinking (reasoning) and clinical judgment that is acquired during the nursing program through clinical venues, classroom experiences and simulation experiences. The focus of this research was to determine the impact that concept-based curriculum had on the development of critical thinking in the classroom and was measured through identified test items on unit exams and the standardized final exam sub-score of Critical Thinking. The results of the study support the conclusion that a concept-based curriculum is more effective than a content-based curriculum in helping students develop critical thinking (reasoning) and clinical judgment based on nursing concepts and concept mapping during classroom sessions. A limitation of this study was that only one medical-surgical course was examined; further studies should include more courses during the associate degree nursing program.

T1  - Effects of Concept Mapping on the Critical Thinking Skills of Baccalaureate Nursing Students
AN  - 1552723008
AB  - Traditional teaching techniques which promote mostly memorization do not help nursing students think critically and solve problems in the clinical setting. The lecture needs to be replaced with evidenced-based methods of improving critical thinking skills of nursing students. The conceptual framework for this exploratory study was based on Ausubel’s theory of meaningful learning, which generated concept mapping. Using a nonexperimental, pretest-posttest design the purpose of this study was to evaluate whether concept maps can be used as a teaching strategy to improve the critical thinking of entry-level nursing students. The research questions were used to determine the difference in overall critical thinking scores as well as individual domain scores (analysis, interpretation, inference, evaluation, explanation, and deductive and inductive reasoning) before and after concept map treatment during a 14-weeek clinical session. The California Critical Thinking Skills instrument was used with a convenience sample of 40 nursing students entering a nursing program. Although overall critical thinking scores increased, paired t test results indicated the difference was not statistically significant. Subscores, however, indicated significant gains in the evaluation domain. Further longitudinal research is needed to test the effect of integrating concept mapping throughout the nursing curriculum on students’ critical thinking. Social change begins when the student is able to connect theory, content, and practice to clinical problem solving in order to provide the safest and highest quality of care in a time-constrained environment.

T1  - The Alternative Assessment-Evaluation Approaches Preferred by Pre-Service Teachers and Their Self-Efficacy towards these Approaches
AN  - 1521719185
AB  - The present research is a survey study carried out on pre-service teachers in the Education Faculty at Celal Bayar University (n=174). The study employed a questionnaire consisting of close-ended and semi-open-ended questions administered to determine the opinions of pre-service teachers about the alternative assessment-evaluation approaches they prefer. Furthermore, the self-efficacy scale was used to determine the efficacy of pre-service teachers towards alternative assessment-evaluation approaches. As shown by the results of the analysis, the pre-service teachers stated that they would like to use frequently instruments such as portfolios, performance assessment, concept maps, observation, and concept cartoons in their future teaching careers. Moreover, the MANOVA results revealed a significant difference in the self-efficacy of pre-service teachers about alternative assessment-evaluation approaches according to gender, while it did not significantly differ with the variables of department and grade. On the basis of the obtained results, certain suggestions are made with regard to the use of alternative assessment-evaluation approaches.

T1  - Factors Influencing Millennials Theatre Intention: A Partial Least Squares Consumer Behavior Analysis in a Delaware University
AN  - 1497278452
AB  - A Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) consumer behavior analysis was conducted to determine factors influencing theatre intention on Millennials in a Delaware University. The survey-based study was applied to a college alumni population in Northern Delaware and had over 1,300 responses. Results were compared to other generational cohorts to deepen the understanding of their decisions as consumers of theatre. An extensive literature review of over 120 published peer review research papers led to the development of the Performing Arts Consumer Behavior Model. The PACBM was the basis for the application of PLS-SEM. Demographic statistical analysis was performed using SPSS to round up the analysis. The comparison between Millennials and other generational cohorts was conducted via PLS-SEM multigroup analysis (PLS-MGA) parametric approach. Results reflect a solid predictive model indicating that attitude and gender have significant influence on intention to attend theatre. No practical differences were found between Millennials and other generational cohorts in this population relative to theatre intention. Results can be applied to the theatre industry in Delaware to increase demand for the discipline.

T1  - Linguistic validation of the Alberta Context Tool and two measures of research use, for German residential long term care
AN  - 1494704875; 24479645
AB  - Doc number: 67

              
Abstract

              
Background: To study the association between organizational context and research utilization in German residential long term care (LTC), we translated three Canadian assessment instruments: the Alberta Context Tool (ACT), Estabrooks' Kinds of Research Utilization (RU) items and the Conceptual Research Utilization Scale. Target groups for the tools were health care aides (HCAs), registered nurses (RNs), allied health professionals (AHPs), clinical specialists and care managers. Through a cognitive debriefing process, we assessed response processes validity-an initial stage of validity, necessary before more advanced validity assessment.

              
Methods: We included 39 participants (16 HCAs, 5 RNs, 7 AHPs, 5 specialists and 6 managers) from five residential LTC facilities. We created lists of questionnaire items containing problematic items plus items randomly selected from the pool of remaining items. After participants completed the questionnaires, we conducted individual semi-structured cognitive interviews using verbal probing. We asked participants to reflect on their answers for list items in detail. Participants' answers were compared to concept maps defining the instrument concepts in detail. If at least two participants gave answers not matching concept map definitions, items were revised and re-tested with new target group participants.

              
Results: Cognitive debriefings started with HCAs. Based on the first round, we modified 4 of 58 ACT items, 1 ACT item stem and all 8 items of the RU tools. All items were understood by participants after another two rounds. We included revised HCA ACT items in the questionnaires for the other provider groups. In the RU tools for the other provider groups, we used different wording than the HCA version, as was done in the original English instruments. Only one cognitive debriefing round was needed with each of the other provider groups.

              
Conclusion: Cognitive debriefing is essential to detect and respond to problematic instrument items, particularly when translating instruments for heterogeneous, less well educated provider groups such as HCAs. Cognitive debriefing is an important step in research tool development and a vital component of establishing response process validity evidence. Publishing cognitive debriefing results helps researchers to determine potentially critical elements of the translated tools and assists with interpreting scores.

T1  - Developing Engineering Students' Understanding of Sustainability Using Project Based Learning
AN  - 1537414737
AB  - Project based learning (PjBL) can be an effective approach to developing graduate attributes, but it depends on how it is implemented. Chemical Engineering of RMIT University has a stream of PjBL subjects from first to final year. The projects are incrementally more complex but have the same goal: to choose a best process design, using management decision making tools to justify their choices. The tools include GEMI Metrics NavigatorTM. This paper reports an evaluation of whether students' understanding of sustainability is enhanced by undertaking multiple projects, as well as use of sophisticated analysis tools. Student learning outcomes from intermediate and final subjects were compared using ConceptMaps and a focus group. The students' understanding of sustainability increased substantially from 2nd to final year, similar to results reported in European studies. The spread of results was broad, attributed to range of student ability and differences between student cohorts. Development of understanding of sustainability was attributed to undertaking multiple projects and use of spread-sheeting tools. Use of the GEMI tool was identified as facilitating application of sustainability principles to process design decisions. Concept maps are a useful way to evaluate innovations in teaching sustainable engineering.

T1  - Fen ve Teknoloji Ögretmenlerine Yönelik Teknoloji Destekli Kavram Haritalari Uygulamalari*/Technologically Supported Concept Map Applications for Science and Technology Teachers
AN  - 1514363389
AB  - In Science and Technology teaching, it is significant to contribute to the meaningful learning of concepts by making use of technologically supported techniques so that the students can construct knowledge correctly in their minds. Concept mapping, one of these techniques, is a visual technique that can reflect a presentation of concepts related to a subject and correlations among them in a hierarchical order. Founding interconceptual relations correctly is required for meaningful learning. It is essential that Science and Technology teachers learn how to use and apply concept mapping techniques in Science and Technology course so that the students could prepare concept maps well. Within this scope, in-service training seminars were held in 7 cities of Turkey, one city from each region where the Science and Technology course teachers are the highest in number. The subjects of the seminars were; "Science and Technology Teaching in scope of Constructivist Approach" "Concept Mapping Technique in Science and Technology Teaching, "Studies towards Practice of Concept Maps", "The Inspiration Program and How to Use It", "Practice Samples Prepared with the Inspiration Concept Mapping Software". Total duration of the seminar equals to 1,5 workday or 8 hours. The seminars were held in Izmir, Erzurum, Ankara, Diyarbakir, Samsun, Antalya and Bursa. This study includes examples of concept maps which Science and Technology teachers prepared during the seminars. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - PSICO-A: A Computational System for Learning Psychology
AN  - 1627752128
AB  - PSICO-A is a new educational system, based on the web, for learning psychology. Its computational architecture consists of a front-end and a back-end. The first one contains a design mode, a reflective mode, a game mode and a simulation mode. These modes are connected to the back-end, which is composed of a rule engine, an evaluation module, a communication module, an expert module, a student module and a metacognitive module. The back-end is the heart of the system analysing the performance of pupils. PSICO-A assembles Boolean equations introducing algorithms such as those of Levenshtein, Hamming, Porter and Oliver. The system design used the programming language PHP5 for a clear and fast interface. PSICO-A is an innovative system because it is the first system in psychology designed for assessing the value of computer-based learning games compared with simulations for teaching the subject. Other systems use virtual environments for teaching subjects like mathematics, physics or ecology to children but the role of digital games and simulations in learning psychology is to date an unexplored field. A preliminary analysis of the motivational value of the system has been performed with sample of undergraduate students, verifying its advantages in terms of to encouraging scientific exploration. An internal evaluation of the system, using the game mode, has been conducted.

T1  - Retrieval Practice, with or without Mind Mapping, Boosts Fact Learning in Primary School Children
AN  - 1450247800
AB  - Retrieval practice is a method of study in which testing is incorporated into the learning process. This method is known to facilitate recall for facts in adults and in secondary-school-age children, but existing studies in younger children are somewhat limited in their practical applicability. In two studies of primary school-age children of 8–12 years, we tested retrieval practice along with another study technique, mind mapping, which is more widely-used, but less well-evidenced. Children studied novel geographical facts, with or without retrieval practice and with or without mind mapping, in a crossed-factorial between-subjects design. In Experiment 1, children in the retrieval practice condition recalled significantly more facts four days later. In Experiment 2, this benefit was replicated at one and five weeks in a different, larger sample of schoolchildren. No consistent effects of mind mapping were observed. These results underline the effectiveness of retrieval practice for fact learning in young children.

T1  - Restructuring the Future Classroom - A Global Perspective
AN  - 1535198179
AB  - The students are the consumers as well as co-creators of knowledge. Information does not flow top-down any more. Networks, peers and students inquisitiveness teach students. Teachers act as filters. Collaboration is the key. In today's world for the netgen, knowingly or unknowingly technology and the free flow of information via internet has made young mind wanting. Over the last few decades, everything has changed in our lives with the all pervasive intervention of technology. However classrooms have remained untouched by technology. The classrooms that our grandparents went to are exactly the kind of classrooms our children study in. Chalk and blackboard, a packed classroom, text books, regimented curriculum, a teacher painstakingly explaining abstract concepts with the limited tools at her disposal. Imagine a Science teacher explaining how a DNA replicates, a History teacher teaching a class about the Harappan Civilization, or a Geography teacher teaching how Block mountains are formed.

T1  - Identifying Differential Performance in General Chemistry: Differential Item Functioning Analysis of ACS General Chemistry Trial Tests
AN  - 1415747756
AB  - The development of high-quality assessments can be an intensive process. At the American Chemical Society Examinations Institute (ACS-EI), this follows a general process of test design and content mapping, item construction, trial testing, item analysis, and final test setting. The item analysis portion of this procedure is an important step in using field-testing results to select the best items. This selection is based on validity analysis by experts, both field-test users and test writers, and by students in field testing. The traditional item analysis of the ACS-EI now includes a differential item functioning analysis with subgroups by gender when a sufficient data set is available. The results of this analysis from six trial tests were further evaluated by both content and format. Trends of specific content areas and by format of items reveal that classes of items favored one subgroup over another in at least four instances. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An Evaluation of the Learning Effectiveness of Concept Map- Based Science Book Reading via Mobile Devices
AN  - 1462203910
AB  - Printed books have long been an important means for people to obtain knowledge; nevertheless, educators have pointed out problems of learning from some printed books, in particular, the lack of learning supports, such as supplementary materials and learning guiding tools. In this study, a concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is proposed for supporting printed science book reading activities for children via mobile devices with QR-code facilities. A quasi-experiment has been conducted in an elementary school to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, in which 92 sixth graders participated. The experimental results show that the concept map-oriented ubiquitous learning approach is significantly more helpful to the students in reading printed books than traditional book reading and the conventional ubiquitous learning approach in terms of learning achievements; moreover, the students had a high level of acceptance of such a mobile technology-assisted learning system in terms of “ease of use”, “usefulness” and "attitude and intention of future use.”

T1  - Effects of Touch Technology-based Concept Mapping on Students' Learning Attitudes and Perceptions
AN  - 1462203783
AB  - Concept maps have become a widely used educational tool around the globe. The advancements in computerized interface technologies have enabled even more alternatives for using concept maps in teaching and learning. This study investigates the effects of two different touch technology-based concept mapping interaction modes on students' learning achievements and learning attitudes in a natural science course, as well as their degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn. Ninety two sixth graders were randomly divided into three groups. Experimental Group One was taught using the Interactive Whiteboard (IWB)-based concept mapping approach, Experimental Group Two learned with the touchscreen-based concept mapping approach, while the control group learned with the traditional paper-and-pencil-based concept mapping approach. The experimental results show that, in terms of learning attitudes toward the natural science course and the degree of acceptance of using concept maps to learn, the students were significantly more positive about the two touch technology-based interaction modes than they were about the traditional paper-and-pencil mode.

T1  - Young Children Can Learn Scientific Reasoning with Teachable Agents
AN  - 1431941457
AB  - A teachable agent (TA) is an instructional technology that capitalizes on the organizing metaphor of teaching another, in this case, a computer agent. As one instance, students teach their agents by creating concept maps that connect nodes with relational links. TAs use simple artificial intelligence to draw conclusions based on what they have been taught and to trace the path of their reasoning visually. TAs literally make thinking visible, with the goal of helping children learn to reason. TAs also provide interactive feedback and engender in students a sense of responsibility toward improving their agents' knowledge. We describe, in detail, a TA designed to teach hierarchical reasoning in science, and then present a 2-year research study using this TA with 153 fourth-grade children learning about organisms, taxonomies, and ecosystems. We show that the TA improved learning from the standard curriculum as measured by the curriculum's accompanying tests. The TA also helped children learn hierarchical reasoning, as measured by researcher-designed tests. The research indicates that, contrary to some theoretical positions, it is possible to help younger children learn scientific modes of reasoning, specifically by means of TA software.

T1  - Conceptual Understanding of the Electrical Concepts of Voltage and Current: A Pilot Study of a Method to Create Representations of Students’ Mental Models
AN  - 2317901743
AB  - Conceptual Understanding and Mental Models of the Electrical Concepts of Voltage and Current Held by Senior Electrical Engineering StudentsEvery field of study has a set of domain-specific concepts that anyone who desires to work inthat field must know and understand. Most students who have obtained university degrees inengineering are presumed to have attained this knowledge. But have they? Usually, assessmentsare made by written examinations that are not able to probe very deeply into the actual mentalmodels that the students use to solve problems. Students may become quite skillful atperforming calculations, doing homework, and passing tests, but without necessarilyunderstanding the course content very deeply.The theory of mental models asserts that most people organize their knowledge of the world bythe construction of mental models of the phenomena they have experienced or concepts theyhave learned. These models are then used to assimilate new experiences or to make predictionsabout what will occur in specific situations. The construction of these models, however, is notdone consciously, so the individual is often unaware of their existence.In the field of electrical engineering, among the most fundamental concepts that students need tounderstand are voltage and current. The mental models that they have constructed of thesephenomena will play a major role in their approaches to and the solving of engineering problemsin their professional career. These models consist of multiple levels of knowledge: definitions,formulas, laws (knowing “that”); procedures (knowing “how”); concepts, cause and effectrelationships (knowing “why”); and problem solving strategies, knowing which methods to useto address a given situation (knowing “when”).To construct representations of students’ mental models, a linguistic analysis of semi-structuredinterviews was used. In this pilot study of the interview protocol and analysis method,interviews were conducted with 2 senior EE students. The intent of the interviews is to engagethe participants in a conversation concerning their knowledge and experience in applying ideasof voltage and current by discussing their experiences in learning about and designing with thethree most fundamental components of all electrical systems: resistors, capacitors, and inductors.In the discussion of these actual components, participants naturally refer to the abstract ideas ofcurrent and voltage as they relate to the components. The interview transcripts were analyzed todetermine a representation of the underlying mental model of each participant that would beconsistent with the content of their interview. Each participant’s mental model is presented as acombination of a graphical concept map accompanied by a short narrative explaining the keyelements of the model.Research that reveals the types of mental models held by senior EE students could inform thedesign of instruction for the aforementioned concepts.

T1  - Promoting Conceptual Understanding in Engineering Statics Through the Use of Adaptive Concept Maps
AN  - 2317873775
AB  - PROMOTING CONCEPTUAL UNDERSTANDING IN ENGINEERING STATICS THROUGH THE USE OF ADAPTIVE CONCEPT MAPS This paper discusses the continuing work on a two year NSF funded project to explore thefeasibility and effectiveness of a scalable concept map based navigation system for a digitaltextbook. This tool, termed the Adaptive Map, is designed to promote the conceptualunderstanding in students by using a concept map of an expert’s knowledge as an advanceorganizer. Because large concept maps become visually cluttered and are therefore less effectiveas learning tools, information visualization techniques have to be used to manage the cognitiveload imposed on the learner. The prototype tool contains content that would be similar to thematerial in a traditional statics textbook, but the information is accessed through this conceptmap based visualization tool that is the focus of the proposed project. The adaptive map tooloptimizes the concept map visual for the current content based on the user’s current focus, givingthem a context for detailed content information. Researchers are evaluating the tool’s effect on conceptual understanding and cognitive loadusing a quasi-experimental setup, comparing two similar classes where one section has beengiven access to the tool (experimental section) and one section has not been given access to thetool (control group). To measure the tool’s effect on conceptual understanding, researchers usedthe Statics Concept Inventory as a primary measure and multi-faceted problem solving activitiesas a secondary measure. To measure cognitive load, researchers used self-reported values ofmental effort during the problem solving sessions, which were designed to ensure that studentsneeded to look something up using the adaptive map or their regular textbook. Results andanalysis of the Adaptive Map evaluation to date are presented.

T1  - Using Innovative Topics to Attract Future Engineers: Liquefaction and Sustainability Modules for Engineering Camp
AN  - 2317862800
AB  - Using Innovative Topics to Attract Future Engineers: Liquefaction and Sustainability Modules for Engineering CampEfforts to attract quality and diverse students into civil engineering have given rise toengineering camps aimed at secondary school students. Innovative topics such as liquefactionand sustainability are topics usually studied in depth in graduate programs in civil engineering.However, recent natural events such as the earthquake in New Zealand, storm surge effects inNew Orleans, along with the on-going issue of global warming have initiated interest andbrought attention to these topics. These phenomena have been connected in a way to begineducating the secondary school students while at the same time encouraging their interests inengineering. To do this, two teaching modules were developed focused on these two topics andimplemented twice, targeting 13 to 16 year old students. The liquefaction module is aimed atfamiliarizing students with the term as well as fundamental engineering concepts related to thetopic. Experiments were conducted both on a small scale shake table available at manyuniversities and a teaching device for fluidized beds also widely available. Students took variousmeasurements and made calculations of density before and after liquefaction. For thesustainability module, the students were introduced to key concepts related to environmental,social, and economic sustainability. Two activities were implemented with regards to ecologicalfootprint and green building. Students calculated their ecological footprint based on a survey oflifestyle-related questions and compared their impacts to average values in developing countries.In addition, they completed a case study assessment of exemplary green buildings and developeda concept map depicting the related triple bottom line goals. To simplify the task ofimplementing the modules, detailed procedures for the experiments/activities, along withworksheets for the students have been developed for interested instructors. The modules havebeen tested at xxx University during the summers of 2011 and 2012 and the survey assessmentresults from student evaluation confirm that the modules are effective in meeting the definedobjectives.

T1  - STEM Students outside the Classroom: The Role of the Institution in Defining Extracurricular Activity
AN  - 2317862482
AB  - Engineering and Computer Science Students outside the Classroom: The Role of the Institution in Defining Extracurricular ActivityParticipation in extracurricular activities often has a positive impact on the academic experienceof students in middle and high school, as well as during the undergraduate years. Whileengineering majors may report lower satisfaction with the college experience than some othermajors, the source of that dissatisfaction does not appear to be reflected in involvement inextracurricular activities. In fact, undergraduate engineering majors are on par with other majorsin the amount of time spent on extracurricular activities. Extracurricular involvement can covera wide range of activities with different academic benefits (and some drawbacks), but little isknown about the nature of extracurricular involvement specifically among engineering students,how it evolves year-to-year, and how it differs according to gender, ethnicity, and institutionalculture.This paper examines the time spent in and the nature of extracurricular activities amongengineering and computer science students at five diverse higher education institutions. Theinstitutions involved in this research represent three types of Carnegie 2010 classifications (Bac-Diverse, Master’s L, and RU-VH); geographical locations in the Northwest, Northeast, Midwest,and Southeast United States; both public and private institutions; and undergraduate enrollmentsvarying from 3,500 to 29,000 students (total for all majors). This analysis is situated within alarger study at these five institutions focused on understanding connections among belonging,community, and engagement within STEM populations. The role of extracurricular activities inthe underlying theoretical framework guiding this research is shown in Figure 1.Survey data were collected from a total of nearly 700 students across the five institutions throughLikert-scale and short-answer questions. The total amount of time that engineering andcomputer science students spend on extracurricular activities each week, as well as the level ofactivity in popular extracurricular activities (including sports, on-line communities, shared livinggroups, and several other non-academic communities) were captured and analyzed. Correlationanalysis, t-tests, one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA), and other standard statistical analysistechniques were used to understand variations in institutional culture and characteristics, as wellas student characteristics as they relate to extracurricular participation and involvement.Our findings indicate that within an institution, the extent of involvement in extracurricularactivities is remarkably consistent among different types of students. Significant differenceswere found only within personality type (introvert or extravert) and one ethnic group (Asianstudents, whether Asian-American or Asian-International). However, variation in extracurricularinvolvement varies broadly across institutions. While the two larger institutions demonstrateextracurricular involvement on par with national averages (as measured by the National Surveyon Student Engagement), the three smaller institutions demonstrate wide variations from thisaverage. Although this research is cross-sectional and not longitudinal in nature, we concludefrom our results that institutional culture, rather than student characteristics, has the strongestinfluence on what undergraduate students do and how often they do it in regard to extracurricularcommunities.Figure 1: Theoretical Framework for this Study(This study focuses on non-major activities, termed Extracurricular in the concept map below).

T1  - The iCollaborate MSE Project: Progress Update 2013
AN  - 2317861195
AB  - The iCollaborate MSE Project: Progress Update 2013The iCollaborate Materials Science and Engineering (MSE) project is a comprehensiveresearch program that has an overarching goal of improving student outcomes inintroductory materials courses. The project is multifaceted and includes severalinterwoven components, all of which are based on literature based best practices inSTEM education. The project components include: a detailed study of pre-courseknowledge and misperceptions, an investigation of student preparation influencing courseoutcomes, an analysis of Index of Learning Styles (ILS) data, a switch to inductiveteaching practices which include collaborative, active learning modules and concept/peerlearning opportunities, collaborative writing of research papers, low stakes quizzing, thedevelopment of targeted iPod applications that promote enhanced student understandingof known conceptual difficulties, MSE vocabulary terms, visual and conceptuallycontained presentations of material properties, material calculators and conversion tools,and the development of a web site based upon concept maps with web applicationversions of the iPod applications. The project includes formative and summativeassessment elements.This paper focuses on previously unreported components of the iCollaborate project thatwere researched, analyzed or developed during the 2011-2012 academic year. A detailedanalysis of student preparation coupled with the comprehensive study of pre-courseconceptual knowledge and misperceptions provided particularly rich and extremelyinformative data sets that are outlined in this paper. Additionally, students perceive thatlow stakes quizzing improve personal outcomes more than the targeted, collaborative andactive modules and iPod applications, but traditional test scores indicate all three enhancecertain student learning outcomes when at least two are present. The entire suite of MSEiPod applications developed for this project (Concept Questions, Vocabulary, BasicKnowledge, Tune-Up, Material Properties, Composite Calculator, MSE Convert, MSEKnowledge Tools and Review) is described in detail. The supporting web site for theproject is currently under development, is concept mapped based, built upon studentinput/assessments, and targeted to address known conceptual difficulties in MSE. Theconcept map base for the project is reported in this paper. The paper concludes with adescription of the remaining objectives for the iCollaborate project for the next academicyear and further dissemination plans. At the conclusion of the project, all materials willbe placed on the NSF sponsored National Science Digital Library (NSDL).The National Science Foundation is supporting the project (NSF CCLI/TUES #XXXX).

T1  - Mapping Changes in Science Teachers’ Content Knowledge: Concept Maps and Authentic Professional Development
AN  - 2259584604
AB  - Two studies were conducted to examine content knowledge changes following 2 weeks of professional development that included scientific research with university scientists. Engaging teachers in scientific research is considered to be an effective way of encouraging knowledge of both inquiry pedagogy and content knowledge. We used concept maps with two cohorts of teachers to assess changes in science teacher knowledge. In study 1, 34 teachers developed pre- and post-concept maps in one of the nine different content areas. A repeated measures analysis of six quantitative scores showed statistically significant increases in knowledge representation. Quantitative and qualitative scoring methods indicate that concept maps are effective for assessing teacher knowledge gains from professional development. Study 2 replicated the results with 24 teachers and provided further information about how knowledge changes.

T1  - Incorporating Concept Mapping in Project-Based Learning: Lessons from Watershed Investigations
AN  - 2259569351
AB  - The concept map tool set forth by Novak and colleagues is underutilized in education. A meta-analysis has encouraged teachers to make extensive use of concept mapping, and researchers have advocated computer-based concept mapping applications that exploit hyperlink technology. Through an NSF sponsored geosciences education grant, middle and secondary science teachers participated in professional development to apply computer-based concept mapping in project-based learning (PBL) units that investigated local watersheds. Participants attended a summer institute, engaged in a summer through spring online learning academy, and presented PBL units at a subsequent fall science teachers’ convention. The majority of 17 teachers who attended the summer institute had previously used the concept mapping strategy with students and rated it highly. Of the 12 teachers who continued beyond summer, applications of concept mapping ranged from collaborative planning of PBL projects to building students’ vocabulary to students producing maps related to the PBL driving question. Barriers to the adoption and use of concept mapping included technology access at the schools, lack of time for teachers to advance their technology skills, lack of student motivation to choose to learn, and student difficulty with linking terms. In addition to mitigating the aforementioned barriers, projects targeting teachers’ use of technology tools may enhance adoption by recruiting teachers as partners from schools as well as a small number that already are proficient in the targeted technology and emphasizing the utility of the concept map as a planning tool.

T1  - CREATING AN INTEGRATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT USING CONCEPTUAL MAPS IN PHYSICS LESSONS
AN  - 1440877152
AB  - We believe that Ausubel's cognitive learning theory provides a strong basis for improving teaching and learning. This work presents the combination of constructivist epistemology, Internet ase and CmapTools, a software toolkit for building conceptual maps to deepen the concepts of "gas laws Conceptual maps are a powerful tool not only for perception, representation and archiving of knowledge, bat also to create new knowledge. It is essential to helping students understand that all concepts are somehow related to each other and to select cross-links as specific as possible and identify' the most appropriate linking words to connect concepts, http://cmapspiiblic.ihmc.iis/rid=lL77HZZH0- JJS3\TW-lS6Q/0.Harta%20conceptual%C4%8. Students who are involved in the construction of conceptual maps of physics are engaged in a creative process, and this can be challenging, especially for students who have spent most of their lives in learning by heart. The CmapTools Software Toolkit brings together the strengths of concept mapping with the power of technology, the Internet and World Wide Web. The software not only makes it easy for users to build and modify concept maps, but allows users to build their remote collaboration and publication, so that anyone can access with links to resources, to explain their content and other information for created conceptual map. CmapTools software tool can serve as a basis for a new kind of integration of Internet resources and all classroom experiences, physical laboratory, and outside them. If it is used in conjunction with conceptual maps designed to support learning, it provides a new educational model. In this present work we used activities that allow students to construct their own structure of conceptual map using a list of concepts also mapping activities that are required students to complete the gaps in the structure of incomplete maps to assess the connections they make between important concepts.

T1  - The Effectiveness of Concept Maps in Teaching Physics Concepts Applied to Engineering Education: Experimental Comparison of the Amount of Learning Achieved With and Without Concept Maps
AN  - 2259569477
AB  - A study was conducted to quantify the effectiveness of concept maps in learning physics in engineering degrees. The following research question was posed: What was the difference in learning results from the use of concept maps to study a particular topic in an engineering course? The study design was quasi-experimental and used a post-test as a measuring instrument. The sample included 114 university students from the School of Industrial Engineering who were divided into two equivalent homogeneous groups of 57 students each. The amount of learning attained by the students in each group was compared, with the independent variable being the teaching method; the experimental group (E.G.) used concept maps, while the control group (C.G.) did not. We performed a crossover study with the two groups of students, with one group acting as the E.G. for the topic of optical fibers and as the C.G. for the topic of the fundamental particles of matter and vice versa for the other group. For each of the two topics studied, the evaluation instrument was a test of 100 dichotomous items. The resulting data were subjected to a comparative statistical analysis, which revealed a significant difference in the amount of learning attained by the E.G. students as compared with the C.G. students. The results allow us to state that for the use of concept maps, the average increment in the E.G. students’ learning was greater than 19 percentage points.

T1  - Helping Teachers Create a Dynamic Learning Environment Using Pen-based Technology
AN  - 2793953149
AB  - There is evidence that Pen-based Technologies (PBTs) can facilitate radical changes that would make it possible to address problems typically associated with lecture-based pedagogical models. In the context of university-level Computer Science studies, there is widespread consensus that PBTs—and tablet PCs, in particular—are tools that have great potential for encouraging interaction in the classroom and promoting a far more dynamic learning environment. In view off the complexity of these types of technology and their explosive evolution, it would be advisable to assist teachers who wish to utilize them by developing strategies based on a conceptualization of their educational capabilities. With this objective in mind, this article analyzes the use of concept maps as tools for modeling both the instructional domain and the PBTs domain. To validate the proposed approach, a number of workshops were conducted, in which professors of Engineering were given a presentation on the educational capabilities of these technologies and then had the opportunity to experiment with tablet PCs and other digital ink devices. Participants completed a pre-questionnaire at the start of the workshop; its questions were generated from a generic concept map for the instructional domain, and its purpose was to list each professor’s instructional requirements. Next, recommendations for use were developed, based on the PBTs concept map, and converted to the questions on a post-questionnaire completed at the end of the workshop, on which the teachers indicated the degree to which they agreed with the recommendations. More than 70 professors from different departments participated in these workshops, and their overall evaluation was quite favorable.

T1  - A Visual World Demands Design Sense: Advocating for Visual Communication Across the Curriculum
AN  - 2774220323
AB  - Design in the 21st century is expanding its effectiveness, influence, and reach through research methods borrowed from other disciplines, such as the social sciences. However, those other disciplines can also benefit by borrowing theoretical and practical understanding from the design field. Speaking and writing skills have long been prized in academia and business, resulting in many universities implementing communication across the curriculum programs. Historically, this “communication” has excluded visual communication or design knowledge. In our increasingly visual culture—and online culture of user-created content—non-designers are called upon in the professional realm to illustrate their ideas. Graduates entering the workforce will encounter situations where they will benefit from possessing some level of design sensibility, even if only to communicate effectively with professional designers. As educators and researchers from different ends of the visual communication spectrum, we believe professional designers should lead the way in integrating visual communications literacy into higher education curricula. They also present an outline of basic design elements and practices that could be incorporated into a visual communication initiative across the curriculum program (or visual communication center), from color, layout, and composition to iterative sketching, modeling, and concept mapping.

T1  - Pre-Service Classroom Teachers’ Mislearnings Of Classification Of The Plant Kingdom And The Effect Of Porphyrios Tree On Removing Them'
AN  - 2343720845
AB  - Students may acquire mislearnings in the course of their academic lives for various reasons and keep them for a lifetime. Some of the most common of those mislearnings are the alternative conceptions university students have about Biology lesson. This study was conducted through one-to-one interviews with 54 students at the 1st grade of the Department of Classroom Teaching in order to determine university students’ alternative learnings about the classification and the diversity of plants and remove these alternative learnings if there were any. In the end, it was found that students had mislearnings about the classification and the diversity of plants. The main mislearning was that students classify some of the plants they knew well in a wrong way according to the criteria which was not biological; for example, they thought fern and bryophyte were plants with seeds, fungi were plants, and the plants belonging to the family of Pinaceae did not have real leaves so they were included in the class of plants without seeds. In order to remove these mislearnings ‘Porphyrios Tree’, which has a structure similar to a concept map, was used. As a result, a great majority of pre-service teachers’ alternative conceptions about the classification of plants were removed through this method of application.

T1  - Concept Mapping In Chemistry Lessons: Tools For Inculcating Thinking Skills In Chemistry Learning
AN  - 2343720407
AB  - The aim of this study is to investigate the combination effect of concept mapping and vee diagrams as thinking tools in Chemistry among some 360 secondary students in Indonesia. This study employed a quasi-experimental approach whereby students were segregated into three intervention groups: concept mapping, vee diagram and thinking skills embedded throughout the lesson (E1), concept mapping (E2) and a conventional approach (E3). Students were also characterized in terms of their ability: High (H), Moderate (M) and Low (L). Students’ thinking skills were measured using a modified version of the Test of Integrated Process Skills (TIPS), which has beed systematically justified in terms of reliability and validity. Analysis of findings reveal that the EI approach is the most effective technique in inculcating students’ thinking skills. A series of follow-up analyses also demonstrate that the E1 approach is best suited for the high ability (H) students as compared to their moderate (M) and low (L) ability counterparts.

T1  - The Impact Of Site-Visits On The Development Of Biological Cognitive Knowledge
AN  - 2343720358
AB  - Classroom-based science teaching tends to be dominated by teaching that stifles the students’ natural curiosity and eagerness to discover their surroundings. Knowledge makes sense to students particularly when it is learned within the context of an authentic experience. Thus classroom-based science needs to be complimented by out-of-classroom activities which offer direct and relevant information that influences students’ learning. Students build new knowledge on already existing schema, thus it is important for both teacher and students to question and evaluate their knowledge to be able to build on solid grounds. This paper illustrates examples of meta-cognitive tools (i.e. Vee diagrams and concept maps) used before and after site-visits to explore the contribution of out-of-classroom activities to the students’ biological cognitive development. This research shows that site-visits are a necessary part of science learning because they help students develop observational and reasoning skills, link biology to personal life experiences and contextualise inert classroom knowledge, making it more meaningful and easier to remember.

T1  - Development and validation of the Patient Opioid Education Measure
AN  - 2222664396
AB  - Background: Although there are screening tools to aid clinicians in assessing the risk of opioid misuse, an instrument to assess opioid-related knowledge is not currently available. The purpose of this study was to develop a content-valid, understandable, readable, and reliable Patient Opioid Education Measure (POEM).
Methods: Using concept mapping, clinicians caring for patients with chronic pain participated in brainstorming, sorting, and rating need-to-know information for patients prescribed opioids. Concept mapping analyses identified seven clusters addressing knowledge and expectations associated with opioid use, including medicolegal issues, prescribing policies, safe use and handling, expected outcomes, side effects, pharmacology, and warnings.
Results: The 49-item POEM was verbally administered to 83 patients (average age 51.3 ± 9.8 years, 77.1% female, 47.1% African American) taking opioids for chronic nonmalignant pain. Patients averaged in total 63.9% ± 14.3% (range 23%–91%) correct responses on the POEM. The POEM demonstrated substantial test-retest reliability (interclass correlation coefficient 0.87). The POEM had a mean readability Lexile (L) score of 805.9 ± 257.3 L (equivalent to approximately a US fifth grade reading level), with individual items ranging from 280 L to 1370 L.
Conclusion: The POEM shows promise for rapidly identifying patients' opioid-related knowledge gaps and expectations. Correcting misunderstandings and gaps could result in safer use of opioids in a clinical care setting.

T1  - When the biology, pedagogy and teaching standards come together
AN  - 1954579501
AB  - Every day, scientific knowledge is growing exponentially and either researcher, nor students have the ability to keep up with literature. On the other hand, new generations of students have different views of information access from that of their older professors and no longer need to depend on professors to obtain information. However, sometimes they are unable to relate this new information to existing knowledge or to transfer it to solve novel problems. It is a challenge for medical educators to search for new pedagogical models that promote in their students the development of strong cognitive processes that allow them to select, integrate, and transfer the new learning and, therefore, to reach meaningful learning. Meaningful learning occurs when the learner interprets, relates, and incorporates new information with existing knowledge and applies the new information to solve novel problems. Meaningful learning, then, involves building multiple representations (mental models) of knowledge. In medicine, meaningful learning implies that knowledge acquired by the students makes sense in their future medical practice and allows them to solve different problems In biology, meaningful learning means that the students are able to apply what they know about biology to novel situations, they are able to predict and explain the responses of a biological system if it is disturbed and sometimes to solve quantitative problems (calculate something). This is easier in the clinical setting than during basic science instruction. During the latter, students receive a great amount of information, some of which does not have direct medical application. Thus, many students in the first semester use rote memorization to acquire a large amount of information that they will forget after the exams. In this study, we addressed the following research question: does the concept mapping methodology, articulated with the mediated learning experience, increase meaningful learning in students attending to the cardiovascular module of a biology course?

T1  - A Participatory, Mixed-Methods Assessment of Clinical Ethics Committees: How Might They Support Clinicians and Positively Impact Care?
AN  - 1648135561
AB  - The primary purpose of this exploratory study to learn how clinical ethics committees in one healthcare system might be more effective in supporting clinicians and their work in critical care settings. This study also attempted to address several issues in previous research. First, committees frequently lack information on what they could do to meet the needs of clinicians facing moral dilemmas, making it challenging for committees to be proactive, purposefully choose committee members and determine their training needs, and plan and support relevant services. Second, most needs assessments have solicited a top-down, management perspective rather than the views of constituent stakeholders. Third, ethics committees activities are often inadequately operationalized and difficult to evaluate. Finally, few studies have examined how different committee activities might potentially impact care.    This research was done in partnership with a large healthcare organization in central Ohio. The community partner wanted data that would drive strategic planning, program development, and evaluation for the seven ethics committees in its system. This study used a structured, mixed methodology, concept mapping, which is specifically designed to analyze and integrate the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. Data was collected from both ethics committee members and a diverse, multi-disciplinary sample of critical care clinicians to generate an inventory of 95 potential committee functions which might support the critical care units. Participants rated each suggestion on two dimensions: potential to positively impact care and perceived current performance by the ethics committees. Rigorous statistical analyses were used to integrate and analyze the data collected. The “concept maps” produced after data analysis graphically displayed multiple dimensions of ethics committee work and performance.    Non committee members organized the suggested committee activities into seven different categories: staff development, guidance, outreach and accessibility, visibility, liaison with system, liaison with patients and families, and ethical and moral support. Individual ideas within each group help operationalize these broader functions and point to potential committee activities beyond the three traditional roles of education, policy development and consultation. Broadly speaking, the participants unaffiliated with ethics committees thought the suggested activities could have more positive impact on patient care than committee members did. Conversely, committee members rated their performance higher than non committee members did. Views about potential impact and perceived current performance varied among the hospitals participating in the rating activity. Within the same hospital, ratings varied among critical care units. A number of other variables - profession, years in healthcare, involvement with ethics committee consults, and use of the ethics committee as the first resource when questions about an ethical dilemma arise – also seemed to influence how ideas were rated. The findings suggest that ethics committees could have a positive impact on care by being more visible and accessible and working directly and proactively with families, particularly around end-of-life dilemmas. Participants also identified a need for interventions which provide staff with moral and ethical support. Social work opportunities for working with ethics committees to address moral and ethical issues, supporting staff emotional needs, and improving communication with families are presented.

T1  - Concept mapping enhances learning of biochemistry
AN  - 1629451397
AB  - Background: Teaching basic science courses is challenging in undergraduate medical education because of the ubiquitous use of didactic lectures and reward for recall of factual information during examinations. The purpose of this study is to introduce concept maps with clinical cases (the innovative program) to improve learning of biochemistry course content. Methods: Participants were first year medical students (n=150) from Saveetha Medical College and Hospital (India); they were randomly divided into two groups of 75, one group attending the traditional program, the other the innovative program. Student performance was measured using three written knowledge tests (each with a maximum score of 20). The students also evaluated the relevance of the learning process using a 12-item questionnaire. Results: Students in the innovative program using concept mapping outperformed those in the traditional didactic program (means of 7.13-8.28 vs. 12.33-13.93, p<0.001). The students gave high positive ratings for the innovative course (93-100% agreement). Conclusion: The new concept-mapping program resulted in higher academic performance compared to the traditional course and was perceived favorably by the students. They especially valued the use of concept mapping as learning tools to foster the relevance of biochemistry to clinical practice, and to enhance their reasoning and learning skills, as well as their deeper understanding for biochemistry.

T1  - Exploring the Experience of Insight and New Knowledge Creation
AN  - 1443861456
AB  - Caring professionals are challenged by complex and unstructured situations. There is evidence that their use of a tacit-intuitive perspective in perplexing circumstances is increasing. A better understanding of insight phenomenology, commonly known as the "aha" moment of solution discovery and new knowledge creation, could help improve caring professionals' performance. Nonaka's dynamic theory of organizational knowledge creation was used as the conceptual framework to guide this phenomenological study. Interviews were conducted with 8 experienced community case managers. A modified phenomenological hermeneutic model of data collection and analysis yielded the research findings, which are displayed in the Nature of Insight and New Knowledge Creation Education Framework, and identified several factors. The essence of the insight includes the importance of experience applied to tacit knowledge-intuitive processes. Caring professionals invest the time to listen actively and build trusting relationships through respectful compassionate commitment. They employ gestalt-systems thinking, mental models, metaphors, concept maps, strategic thinking, creative problem solving, and reflective processing to experience the insight moment of solution discovery and new knowledge creation. This new knowledge is shared collaboratively through informal and formal tacit knowledge educational workplace exchanges. Recommendations focus on the nature of insight and the value of tacit knowledge with intuitive application. The study contributes to positive social change by informing educational curricula of programs to improve caring professionals' workplace practices with clients in the successful application of the tacit-intuitive phenomenon.

T1  - Unequal treatment or uneven consequence: A content analysis of Americans with Disabilities Act Title I disparate impact cases from 1992–2012
AN  - 1443861344
AB  - The purpose of this research was to examine the patterns and themes of litigation in Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) disability discrimination cases charged under the theory of disparate impact. Specifically, this study used Computer Assisted Legal Research (CALR) to identify and review all U.S. Appellate Court ADA disparate impact cases as reported by Westlaw, a commercial electronic case law reporting system owned by Thomson Reuters.      This study used a two-step, mixed methods approach to analyze the data relevant to the research questions and sub-questions. First, the researcher employed content analysis (Hall & Wright, 2008) to identify and characterize patterns and trends of litigation in all reported U.S. Appellate Court ADA cases charged under the theory of disparate impact from 1992 through 2012. Cases were analyzed chronologically, and variables included number of published and unpublished cases, distribution of jurisdiction, distribution of ADA titles, EEOC involvement, case fact patterns, and characteristics of charging and opposing parties. Frequency analyses were conducted on these data. Second, the researcher identified a subset of the ADA disparate impact cases analyzed in the first step: Title I, or employment discrimination cases. Qualitative analysis employing the constant comparative method (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) was used to identify and characterize patterns and themes of the judicial opinions in the Title I disparate impact cases. The researcher developed a framework for analysis based on a review of the literature of the sociopolitical perspective of disability to guide the analysis of the judicial opinions in the subset of disparate impact cases. The results of the frequency analyses conducted on these data revealed four trends: (a) Precedent, (b) Circuit and Judge Effects, (c) Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Successes, and (d) Sutton Case Effect. The results of the qualitative analysis of the text of the judicial opinions produced four themes and three relationships among the themes. The four themes were accommodation(s); workplace culture, norms, and policies; judicial process; and policy space. The three relationships were gap-filling, weighing and balancing, and maintaining status quo versus effecting social change. The themes and relationships are depicted in a concept map that visually displays the conceptual framework revealed in the study.      The findings in this study may inform disability and rehabilitation scholars about ADA disparate impact cases, a body of law about which little is known. The patterns and trends identified in ADA Title I disparate impact cases may provide information about the types of policies and practices that are most frequently litigated. Rehabilitation practitioners may be able to use the results of this research to develop education and outreach strategies for employers on best practices for hiring, accommodating, and promoting employees with disabilities. Because the workplace policies and procedures identified in the cases that comprise this study are neutral on their face rather than intentionally discriminatory, employers may benefit from information that assists them in evaluating their policies and procedures proactively, which may avoid costly and time-consuming litigation. Finally, workplace policies and procedures that fairly represent the essential functions of the job and are applied uniformly to workers with and without disabilities will contribute to a more diverse workforce.

T1  - Changing Student Learning Approaches in Fundamental Accounting Education Through the Use of Graphic Organizers
AN  - 1442193427
AB  - The field of accounting has experienced dramatic changes in the past 20 years. Advances in technology and workplace requirements have changed the responsibilities in the accounting position of a historical recorder to a functioning manager within the organization. The curriculum used by accounting instructors has not changed or kept pace with redefinition of accounting competency. This study was designed to measure the effectiveness of graphical organizers in teaching accounting. Assessment was based on a deep versus surface approach checklist which was altered to reflect accounting terminology. Means testing was the primary comparison protocol. Two classes were selected in an Oregon community college which were instructed by the same instructor. One class used graphic organizers as a communication tool, and the other class did not. Results did not indicate or favor one method over the other. Other learning factors contributed to the lack of significance in this study.

T1  - A design-based approach to teaching sustainability
AN  - 1399161413
AB  - We live on a finite ecological system, yet consume as though resources are unlimited. Current environmental data suggests many in the developed world are living beyond what the earth is able to sustain. The paradigms in which we operate continue to support a path of constant consumption that continues to exacerbate this problem. Technology educators can and should play a valuable role in working with students to question these paradigms through lessons that begin to engage students toward thinking about a more sustainable future.    Design-based instruction provides a framework for instructional practices that allows students to build problem-solving and critical thinking skills as they begin to understand deeper concepts related to sustainability. This study examined middle school students' understanding of sustainability after completing a design based unit. The study evaluated student work, concept maps, observations and pre-and post-tests to determine student understanding of sustainability. Instruction involved aspects of problem-based learning, design education and the use of technology.     Students were given an authentic problem of designing a sustainable home. As part of the design process, students conducted research on the factors and specific design components that would make a home sustainable. The main question guiding this study was "How can a home design project impact middle school students' understanding and appreciation of sustainability?"    The findings suggest students demonstrated significant growth in understanding concepts of sustainability and were able to apply sustainable concepts in their designs. Eighty percent of students were able to meet or exceed rubric expectations on explaining the importance of sustainability. All of the students also demonstrated considerable growth in the understanding and application of sustainable solutions to their designs. They were able to propose authentic solutions to the problem and apply their research.

T1  - The Handover Toolbox: a knowledge exchange and training platform for improving patient care
AN  - 1778810393
AB  - Background              Safe and effective patient handovers remain a global organisational and training challenge. Limited evidence supports available handover training programmes. Customisable training is a promising approach to improve the quality and sustainability of handover training and outcomes.              Objective              We present a Handover Toolbox designed in the context of the European HANDOVER Project. The Toolbox aims to support physicians, nurses, individuals in health professions training, medical educators and handover experts by providing customised handover training tools for different clinical needs and contexts.              Methods              The Handover Toolbox uses the Technology Enhanced Learning Design Process (TEL-DP), which encompasses user requirements analysis; writing personas; group concept mapping; analysis of suitable software; plus, minus, interesting rating; and usability testing. TEL-DP is aligned with participatory design approaches and ensures development occurs in close collaboration with, and engagement of, key stakeholders.              Results              Application of TEL-DP confirmed that the ideal formats of handover training differs for practicing professionals versus individuals in health profession education programmes. Training experts from different countries differed in their views on the optimal content and delivery of training. Analysis of suitable software identified ready-to-use systems that provide required functionalities and can be further customised to users' needs. Interest rating and usability testing resulted in improved usability, navigation and uptake of the Handover Toolbox.              Conclusions              The design of the Handover Toolbox was based on a carefully led stakeholder participatory design using the TEL-DP approach. The Toolbox supports a customisable learning approach that allows trainers to design training that addresses the specific information needs of the various target groups. We offer recommendations regarding the application of the Handover Toolbox to medical educators.

T1  - Human Flourishing in NURSING EDUCATION: Creating Pathways to Fulfill the Person's Unique Potential
AN  - 1086347574; 23061197
AB  - Given the phenomenon of human flourishing in the lived experience of today's nursing students, foundational concepts presented in narrative dialogue on topics such health and illness, human dignity, compassion, vulnerability, and cultural and ethnic diversity establish a critical framework where students and faculty, as colleagues in the art and science of nursing, arrive at an inestimable understanding of the healing relationship between patient and nurse.  Incorporating the concept of human flourishing into the design of assessment instruments, care plans, concept maps, case studies, or brief concept papers creates effective learning activities that engage students and faculty in the understanding that human flourishing is a symphony of virtues, values, present experiences, and the articulation of a preferred future.

T1  - ChemVoyage: A Web-Based, Simulated Learning Environment with Scaffolding and Linking Visualization to Conceptualization
AN  - 1021199574
AB  - The Web is now a standard tool for information access and dissemination in higher education. The prospect of Web-based, simulated learning platforms and technologies, however, remains underexplored. We have developed a Web-based tutorial program (ChemVoyage) for a third-year organic chemistry class on the topic of pericyclic reactions to illustrate this approach with scaffolding and visual auxiliaries. The questions in the tutorial are tiered to simulate the pyramidal structure of knowledge and interlinked to form concept maps required to aid student learning. Visual cues and remedial exercises are linked to advanced questions to facilitate integration of knowledge. Students advance through lower levels to reach higher levels at their own pace. This Web-based learning program provides flexible delivery for the learner and records the learning history of an individual user for the instructor. The diagnostic information helps with reflective teaching and facilitates independence of the learner. Student feedback shows that this is an effective approach in improving their learning outcomes.

T1  - Enhancing Students' Understanding of Dynamics Concepts Through a New Concept Mapping Approach: Tree of Dynamics
AN  - 2317786624
AB  - Enhancing Students’ Understanding of Dynamics Concepts Through a New Concept Mapping Approach - Tree of DynamicsAbstractDynamics is a high-enrollment and high-impact, core engineering course that nearly all studentsin mechanical, aerospace, civil, biological, and biomedical engineering programs are required totake. However, dynamics is also widely regarded as one of the most difficult courses to succeedin because the course covers a broad spectrum of foundational concepts. Lacking a solidunderstanding of dynamics concepts is among the major reasons that many students performpoorly in dynamics.Concept mapping, developed upon constructivist learning theory, is a graphical representation(like a flow chart) that shows how individual concepts are related to and connected with oneanother and form large wholes. Since its development in 1972 by Joseph Novak and hiscolleagues who sought to follow and understand changes in children’s knowledge of science,concept mapping has been adopted in nearly every discipline ranging from STEM (science,technology, engineering, mathematics), psychology, and medicine to business, economics,accounting, history, and literature by institutions ranging from K-12 to undergraduate education.Engineering instructors have also applied the concept mapping technique to the teaching andlearning of dynamics concepts.This paper proposes a new concept mapping approach, called the “Tree of Dynamics,” toenhancing students’ understanding of dynamics concepts. The new approach has two uniquefeatures. First, the relationships among dynamics concepts are represented by “tree” structuresincluding roots, trunks, branches, leaves, and fruits. “Tree” structures enhance students’ intuitivecognition (perception) of the hierarchical relationships among dynamics concepts and also addfun to student learning. In the conventional concept mapping approach, linking words or phrasesare employed to represent the relationships among concepts, which requires students to havehigh skills of abstractive cognition. Second, active learning (learning by “doing”) is highlyinvolved in the new concept mapping approach. Students construct their own “trees” rather thenthe instructor constructing “trees” for students. In the conventional concept mapping approach,the instructor constructs a concept map and demonstrates it to students, and then students learnby “watching and listening,” which is essentially a way of passive learning.The “Tree of Dynamics” approach was recently implemented in an engineering dynamics courseat a large public research university. The purpose was to improve students’ understanding ofdifferences and relationships among seven key dynamics principles and to help students see the“big picture” of dynamics. A total of 76 undergraduates participated in the study. The paperpresents four representative examples of students-generated “trees.” Pre-post tests wereadministrated to measure student learning gains. The assessment results show that the averagelearning gain for all student participants was 64.2%. Compared to the average pretest score, theaverage post-test score increased 1.45 standard deviations. Among the 76 students surveyed, 54students (71%) agreed or strongly agreed that the “Tree of Dynamics” helped them understandhierarchical relationships among dynamics principles and associated equations.

T1  - Assessing Instructional Modules that Accentuate Student Performance
AN  - 2317782369
AB  - Assessing Instructional Modules that Accentuate Student Performance Mysore NarayananThe main objective of a well designed instructional module is to ensure that the subjectmatter content is effectively integrated with the presentation format. In other words, thetask in front of the instructor would be to blend the content and presentation in theory aswell as practice. Here, the instructor assumes the role of a facilitator and effectivelyutilizes modern technology to experiment on innovative ideas that can lead to newclassroom instructional strategies (Tozman, 2004).The literature supports our intuitive belief that education in a new learning paradigm willprepare students for the work ahead of them (Cox, Grasha and Richlin, 1997). Thisindeed helps in raising expectations from the students. Whether it be performance artslike theatre and music, or be it a laboratory setting like physics or biology, studentperformance can be effectively accentuated by adopting creative instructional lessonplans. Furthermore, many of our educational institutions have tried to move away fromemphasizing the establishment of a strong knowledge-base (Young and Young, 1999).In this paper the author discusses two models that he has successfully utilized foraccentuating student performance. The first is identified as Concept Mapping Model andthe second in identified as Structured Content Model.The Concept Mapping Model utilizes the principles of a learning paradigm. (Tagg, 2003).The principle is to select an appropriate learning paradigm approach and preferablycategorize and assign the needed information into the various components of that chosenparadigm. A model for knowledge acquisition and content delivery can be suggestedhowever, this is normally accomplished utilizing well established and standardizedbuilding blocks of a learning paradigm (Barr and Tagg, 1995).The Structured Content Model may be chosen as an alternative when the instructor findsthat the Concept Mapping Model may not be suitable. Here subject matter content canbe created independent of presentation format or delivery methodology. Regardless, thisis not completely open ended and is mainly dictated by the educational objectives andcourse outcomes.References:Barr, R.B. and Tagg, J. (1995, November/December).

T1  - Towards an “Adaptive Concept Map”: Creating an Expert-Generated Concept Map of an Engineering Statics Curriculum
AN  - 2317778194
AB  - Creating a Concept Map of Engineering StaticsConcept maps are graphical representations of cognitive knowledge structures. They wereoriginally developed as a way to follow and understand changes in student knowledge, but theywere also found to be effective instructional tools. Concept maps consist of labeled nodes thatrepresent concepts, or perceived regularities or patterns, and links which are labeled to indicatethe relationships between the nodes. The authors are exploring ways to use concept maps toorganize and navigate information in a digital textbook for engineering statics. If successful, theconcept mapping tool could be used to cognitively link information between courses inengineering mechanics and then across the entire engineering curriculum.As the first step in this process, the authors set out to capture an expert’s knowledge in the formof a concept map. This paper details the process of capturing expert knowledge of a course, inthis case engineering statics, and organizing this information into a concept map that accuratelyrepresents the information taught in the course. Traditional concept mapping techniques call forthe use of a focus question to limit the scope of the resulting concept map. Because the scope ofengineering statics far exceeds a single focus question, an alternative process for developing themap had to be developed. The authors instead used a bottom-up approach. An experiencedprofessor, someone who had been teaching a statics course for several years and who was veryfamiliar with the content, was chosen to act as the expert in the engineering statics content. Theprocess of gathering this expert’s knowledge began by having the expert brainstorm differentconcepts that were believed to be important and listing all of these ideas. The ideation processwas assisted by looking through existing textbooks and course syllabi. The ideas were thenorganized into several groups based on commonalities. Repeated concepts, concepts outside ofthe scope of the course, and other unnecessary concepts were eliminated during the groupingprocess. The concepts in each group were then organized and linked together to form a conceptmap for each group. During this time, missing concepts were identified and added to the list ofconcepts for each group. After all individual groups were organized into concept maps, conceptswere linked between groups, connecting all of the individual concept maps into one cohesivemap. The validity of the resulting concept map was checked by having two other experiencedstatics instructors examine and evaluate the concept map that was created.

T1  - High School Students’ Habits of Mind and Action in Engineering Design
AN  - 2317777736
AB  - High School Students’ Habits of Mind and Action in Engineering DesignRationaleEmploying engineering design in elementary and primary school curricula could potentiallybenefit a broad and diverse group of students whether or not they pursue engineering as a career.It has also been proffered that engineering design has the promise of enhancing and integratingthe science, technology, and mathematics content areas. However, there are many questions yetto be answered regarding engineering design as it pertains to its role in primary and secondaryeducational settings. Some of those questions include: what does engineering design look like K-12? what do the students do and how do they think when working an engineering designproblem?There are different approaches to engage students in engineering design through variouseducational activities. One of those activities is the engineering design challenge. The aim of thisresearch study was to understand and describe high school students’ habits of mind and actionwhile engaged in an engineering design challenge.Methodology and TechniquesThis study included 9 high school-aged participants. The participants worked in various teamsizes (one, two, and four) to work through an engineering design challenge. The participantswere given access to a computer and engineering sketching paper to complete the design.Immediately following the design challenge, the participants participated in a reflectiveinterview.The analysis of this study was carried out through constant comparative analysis of a modifiedverbal protocol analysis. In this research study multiple forms of data were gathered,triangulated, and analyzed. These forms included audio and video recordings of the designchallenge and the interview, computer tracking, and student generated sketches. Inductive aswell as deductive phenomena were thematically analyzed. Concept maps of the students’ designprocesses were also generated and analyzed.Themes and FindingsThrough the qualitative analysis, various results were derived. The results imply that engineeringdesign can be part of a high school engineering curriculum. Comparisons were made between thestudents’ use of problem and solution spaces. The students were able to consider and exploremultiple design alternatives. The students were able to draw upon analogous experiences in lieuof professional expertise to better understand and expand their designs. The students stated andfound the design challenges authentic and relevant to their everyday lives. The results alsoreinforced the importance of scaffolding for engineering concepts and design. Other findingsincluded information gathering with the Internet, student reaction to open-ended problems, andthe complimentary roles of questioning and decision-making. Implications to engineering designcurriculum for K-12 and implications will be discussed.

T1  - Advancing Personalized Engineering Learning via an Adaptive Concept Map
AN  - 2317777443
AB  - ADVANCING PERSONALIZED ENGINEERING LEARNING VIA AN ADAPTIVE CONCEPT MAP There is a well recognized need to produce innovative engineers that have a strongfundamental understanding of engineering but are equally adept at applying their knowledge innovel domains. Concept maps are effective interventions in providing students with a holisticunderstanding of a domain while also allowing understanding of relationships among parts andacross the engineering curricula. Yet when the domain of application is large, concept mapsbecome overburdened with too much information and complexity. A function of the individuallearners’ cognitive load abilities, this phenomenon (termed “map shock”) results in studentdisengagement and reduction of expected learning gains. This limitation prevents the creation ofconcept maps that provide a unified framework for engineering knowledge across courses andcurricula. Thus, existing approaches to implementing expert-generated concept maps as contentrepositories are limited by: (i) an inability to effectively convey a large quantity of informationand (ii) an inability to adapt the presentation of information for each learner’s individualcognitive needs. To address these limitations, we apply theoretical research on adaptive expertise, conceptmaps, and information visualization to design, develop and assess a cyberlearning tool thatadvances personalized learning and helps students develop deep and broad conceptualknowledge. The proposed visualization tool, the “adaptive concept map,” overcomes theproblem of map shock by providing the user control over the quantity and level of detail ofinformation displayed, thus providing a means for navigating content in a manner that isadaptable to their personal cognitive load needs. The adaptive concept map tool is being developed initial for engineering statics content. Itwill be provided to students at two universities to be used as a supplemental “digital textbook.”The tool will be evaluated by comparing measures of conceptual understanding and cognitiveload between experimental groups (those with access to the adaptive map tool) and controlgroups (those without access to the adaptive map tool). This poster presents the progress that has been made with this project thus far. The contentand software development processes is outlined and a working prototype of the tool isshowcased. A section of the content development process, the development of a concept map ofall engineering statics content, will be discussed in more detail in another paper at thisconference. Preliminary results from pilot testing will also be presented.

T1  - Assessing Evolving Conceptual Knowledge in Software Engineering Students
AN  - 2317777090
AB  - Assessing Evolving Conceptual Knowledge in Software Engineering StudentsOver the past decade, the software engineering education community has focused significantlyon defining the body of concepts that both undergraduate and graduate students should (in somesense) “know” and be able to apply upon graduation. Efforts such as the SWEBOK, the SEEK,and the GSwE2009 together with associated certification processes from IEEE (CSDP andCSDA) and ISO (ISO/IEC 24773:2008) go to great lengths to define outcomes primarily ascoverage of the maturing body of knowledge (BOK) in software engineering. The evolution ofthe software engineering BOK and certifications over the past decade+ is a good thing as itspeaks to the maturing of the profession. However, defining program outcomes in terms ofcontent taxonomies flies in the face of emerging trends toward active and discovery-basedteaching and learning techniques (be it called “hands-on”, “project-centric”, or “self-paced”).One criticism of active or discovery-based learning approaches is that they are not the most cost-effective modality for transmitting information. To say it directly, an instructor can cover farmore content in a traditional lecture format that in a project (or other applied) format. In light ofrecent pervasive budget pressures in higher education, the ability to cover more with less formore customers (students) is a practical reality. A second criticism of the active approach is thatindividual assessment is difficult as project work is typically done in teams. Further, it isnecessary for an instructor to continuously monitor class progress as a whole toward learningoutcomes, which is complex in an environment where team progress evolves distinctly andnonlinearly. Teams do not learn at the same rate, go about applied work in the same way, andcome upon the hoped-for “aha” moment at the same time. The authors believe hybridpedagogical approaches such as scaffolding or the Software Enterprise are the best ways toaddress this issue.Is it more important to “collect more knowledge” or to gain an understanding of how thoseconcepts relate so that a sustainable learning structure is formed? Active learning proponentswould suggest it is more important to create a durable conceptual foundation by which newexperiences are assimilated to grow the personal knowledge base in an orderly, well-formedway. But how can one assess that this is happening? In our project-centric courses we haveadopted concept maps as a technique for evaluating the evolution of student understanding ofconceptual knowledge in software engineering. This paper will describe the concept mappingexercise students are asked to conduct at the beginning and end of every semester, the evaluationof concept maps through a unique expert ranking process, and the automation of concept mapevaluation to expert concept maps through graph comparison algorithms. Data collected fromalmost two years’ of concept map practice will be presented and analyzed from the perspectivewhether this is a viable technique in the present context of software engineering education.

T1  - Enhancing Expertise, Sociability, and Literacy through Teaching Artificial Intelligence as a Lab Science
AN  - 2317776219
AB  - Enhancing Expertise, Sociability and Literacy through Teaching Artificial Intelligence as a Lab ScienceThe Teaching Artificial Intelligence as a Laboratory Science (TAILS) project is designed todevelop a new paradigm for teaching introductory artificial intelligence (AI) concepts byimplementing an experimental approach modeled after the lab sciences. It explores whetherstructured labs with exercises that are completed in teams before students leave the classroomcan build a sense of accomplishment, confidence, community, and collaboration among students,characteristics which have been shown to be critical to retain women and non-traditionalcomputer science students in the field.TAILS presents to students an array of fundamental AI algorithms as a set of hands-on activitiesmade available through a database of lab activities, including software exercises and experimentsthat provide experience with concepts from multiple perspectives and multiple modes ofrepresentation. Best practices in software engineering will be reinforced in students throughcareful design and documentation of the modulesThe proposed activities are designed to engage the kinetic learner and provide the “big picture”that model-driven learners need to assimilate course material. Existing research has shown thatstructured labs with exercises that can be completed before students leave the classroom build asense of accomplishment and confidence. Progressively sophisticated experiments teachinexperienced students and challenge more advanced students.TAILS contributes two components to STEM education: a set of lab experiments to promotestudent retention of concepts and retention of majors, and insight into student learning throughthe labs. TAILS contributes to exemplary STEM education by creating learning materials andstrategies, implementing new instructional strategies, and assessing and evaluating studentThis project addresses learning outcomes in five categories: skills (students will demonstrateachievement.the ability to solve problems collaboratively as they work in pairs to complete labactivities), concepts (students will demonstrate knowledge of artificial intelligence andsoftware engineering concepts), communication (students will be able to describe courseconcepts at multiple levels of abstraction), application (students will be able to identifyapplications of AI concepts), and research (students will demonstrate curiosity aboutcourse material). Assessments will draw from standard classroom assessments described byAngelo and Cross (1993) and the Online Evaluation Resource Library. They will include inpart a teamwork attitude questionnaire, a team process log to record perceptions aboutcollaboration, exam questions and pre- and post-tests, explanation and implementation ofsoftware code, concept maps, contrasts of multiple concepts, specification of requirementsfor a software program , domain- and implementation-level design of software programs,descriptions of algorithms geared toward non-computer scientists and technical managers,application cards, explanations of the objectives and significance of experiments, andenhancement of algorithms.TAILS contributes to the STEM education knowledge base by promoting individual efforts tosolve a programming assignment while building an education community through laboratorywork that encourages cooperation and teamwork among students. The paradigm can be adaptedto computer science courses at all academic levels and is expected to increase participation in thefield by shortening the time required to prepare undergraduates to engage in research.This paper describes the nature of this project and presents preliminary results.ReferencesAngelo, Thomas A. and Cross, K.

T1  - Does constructivist approach applicable through concept maps to achieve meaningful learning in Science?
AN  - 1955899634
AB  - This study deals with the application of constructivist approach through individual and cooperative modes of spider and hierarchical concept maps to achieve meaningful learning on science concepts (e.g. acids, bases & salts, physical and chemical changes)). The main research questions were: Q (1): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of spider concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (2): is there any difference in individual and cooperative modes of hierarchical concept maps' to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (3): out of spider and hierarchical maps, which one is more effective to achieve meaningful learning in science? Q (4): is this concept map is being applicable for constructivist approach? Sixty-four 7th grade students from an Indian elementary school participated in the study. Thirty-four and thirty participants treated through spider and hierarchical concept map approach with both cooperative and individual modes. It was an immediate and delayed test experimental design. Two teaching approaches used for two experimental groups: one based upon spider concept map approach and other was hierarchical map approach. After all, students' immediate and delayed, cooperative and individual map of both groups were scored and analyzed by using, Jena & Panda, 2009 scoring procedure. The parametric tests, such as one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer Multiple Comparisons Test used to identify any differences between spider and hierarchical map approach, concerning cooperative and individual modes of learning. Both cooperative spider and hierarchical concept map were significantly better than individual learning in science concept. Therefore, concept map is a constructivist learning

T1  - Using laboratory activities enhanced with concept cartoons to support progression in students' understanding of acid-base concepts
AN  - 1955899534
AB  - The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an intervention based on a series of laboratory activities enhanced with concept cartoons. The purpose of the intervention was to enhance students' understanding of acid-base chemistry for eight grade students' from two classes in a Turkish primary school. A pretest-posttest non-equivalent groups design and one experimental group (EG; N = 19) and one comparison group (CG; N = 17) were used in the study. While the comparison group taught with laboratory activities-based instruction, the experimental group received concept cartoon enhanced laboratory activities-based instruction. Acid-Base Achievement Test (ABAT) consisting of 25 multiple-choice questions was administered in the form of a pretest/posttest research design. Besides, pre-interview was used for collecting data. Alternative conceptions identified in the pretest and pre-interviews were incorporated into the intervention, which thereby sought to move students toward views more in accord with scientific views for the concepts. The results of the study indicated that while there is no statistically significant difference between groups in pretest, performance of EG students is greater than the CG ones in posttest. Besides, the EG students are better in remediating their alternative conceptions related to concepts of acid-base chemistry. The findings show that laboratory activities enhanced with concept cartoons help student improve their understanding and reduce their alternative conceptions.

T1  - Visualising Conversation Structure across Time: Insights into Effective Doctor-Patient Consultations
AN  - 1325018670
AB  - Effective communication between healthcare professionals and patients is critical to patients’ health outcomes. The doctor/patient dialogue has been extensively researched from different perspectives, with findings emphasising a range of behaviours that lead to effective communication. Much research involves self-reports, however, so that behavioural engagement cannot be disentangled from patients’ ratings of effectiveness. In this study we used a highly efficient and time economic automated computer visualisation measurement technique called Discursis to analyse conversational behaviour in consultations. Discursis automatically builds an internal language model from a transcript, mines the transcript for its conceptual content, and generates an interactive visual account of the discourse. The resultant visual account of the whole consultation can be analysed for patterns of engagement between interactants. The findings from this study show that Discursis is effective at highlighting a range of consultation techniques, including communication accommodation, engagement and repetition.

T1  - The ACS Exams Institute Undergraduate Chemistry Anchoring Concepts Content Map I: General Chemistry
AN  - 1013851800
AB  - To provide tools for programmatic assessment related to the use of ACS Exams in undergraduate chemistry courses, the ACS Exams Institute has built a content map that applies to the entire undergraduate curriculum. At the top two levels, the grain size of the content classification is large and spans the entire undergraduate curriculum. At the bottom two levels, the grain size of the content is more fine and tuned to specific course levels of the curriculum. This paper presents all four levels of the map as identified for first-year general chemistry. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Building the ACS Exams Anchoring Concept Content Map for Undergraduate Chemistry
AN  - 1013846114
AB  - The ability to coherently assess content knowledge throughout an entire undergraduate career represents a significant advantage for programmatic assessment strategies. Chemistry, as a discipline, has an unusual tool in this regard because of the nationally standardized exams from the ACS Exams Institute. These exams are norm-referenced and allow chemistry departments to make comparisons between the performance of their own students relative to national samples; however, currently there appears to be no systematic means for noting students' content knowledge growth over a four-year degree. The Exams Institute is undertaking the task of organizing content along an anchoring concept or "big ideas" framework to facilitate this type of analysis. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - A framework for access to the conservation-restoration profession via the mapping of its specialist competencies
AN  - 927705345
AB  - The paper describes how specific descriptors for the Conservation-Restoration profession have been developed by the European Confederation of Conservator-Restorers' Organizations. The result of which is in accordance with the threefold rubric of Knowledge, Skills and Competence as defined by the European Qualifications Framework. Instead of giving a broad general description of level, which is insufficiently expressive, concept mapping has been used to explicitly uncover the topography of Knowledge, Skills and Competence required for access to the profession. The application of this method, originally developed by Novak in 1972 to enhance learning in the sciences, demonstrates that it is possible to elucidate the complex nature of such professions using such a declarative system. Its hierarchical nature and the ease with which links between different elements can be identified aid the construction of an intellectually robust framework, thereby demonstrating its appropriateness. The results suggest that access to the profession can be presented as a framework of interconnected cognitive competencies, which can be expressed as a structural process where each element possesses an individual level of skill and knowledge.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

AB  - Purpose – This article aims to describe the standards‐based approach used to build the International Studies Research Methods (INS250) course, a discipline‐specific, credit‐based class taught by librarians. This writing‐intensive course emphasizes information literacy and critical thinking skills, which were developed using written assignments, class presentations, multiple assessment methods, and web‐based applications.Design/methodology/approach – This paper will review the literature about discipline‐specific, credit‐based information literacy (IL) courses and outcomes. It will also analyze the INS250 course structure and map ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education to learning outcomes for the course.Findings – The paper finds that, in the absence of discipline‐specific information literacy standards, the ACRL Information Literacy Competency Standards for Higher Education can serve as a starting point for International Studies course outcomes and assessment. Other assessment approaches, specifically student workshops and concept maps, promote student engagement and provide ample evidence of student learning.Originality/value – This article will identify research skills needed by International Studies majors and students in similar multidisciplinary programs. It will serve as a model of how to build a credit‐based course with application to other fields such as political science, sustainability, human rights and international business. The course is student‐focused and responsive to new disciplines and areas, with an emphasis on disciplinary databases, search skills, and citation skills.

T1  - Concept Development and Meaningful Learning Among Electrical Engineering Students Engaged in a Problem-Based Laboratory Experience
AN  - 2259586869
AB  - This phenomenographic study documented changes in student-held electrical concepts the development of meaningful learning among students with both low and high prior knowledge within a problem-based learning (PBL) undergraduate electrical engineering course. This paper reports on four subjects: two with high prior knowledge and two with low prior knowledge. Subjects were interviewed at the beginning and end of the course to document their understanding of basic electrical concepts. During the term, they were videotaped while solving problems in lab. Concept maps were generated to represent how subjects verbally connected concepts during problem-solving. Significant to PBL research, each subject’s body of meaningful learning changed with each new problem, according to how the subject idiosyncratically interpreted the activity. Prior knowledge among the four subjects was a predictor of final knowledge, but not of problem-solving success. Differences in success seemed related more to mathematical ability and habits of mind. The study concluded that, depending on context, meaningful learning and habits of mind may contribute significantly to problem-solving success. The article presents a testable model of learning in PBL for further research.

T1  - Joined up thinking? Evaluating the use of concept-mapping to develop complex system learning
AN  - 1009042624
AB  - In the physical and natural sciences, the complexity of natural systems and their interactions is becoming better understood. With increased emphasis on learning about complex systems, students will be encountering concepts that are dynamic, ill-structured and interconnected. Concept-mapping is a method considered particularly valuable for enabling learning in subject areas that are complex or ill-structured. Evaluations of concept-mapping tend to reflect their many applications. Many evaluations that try to measure enhancements in learning use test scores or grade-point averages as performance indicators, which provide little information on how cognitive processes have developed. In this study, a modification of the Biggs and Collis' Structure of the Observed Learning Outcomes (SOLO) taxonomy is applied to measure differences in the cognitive and structural complexity of learning outcomes between groups of students who participated in a concept-mapping activity with those from a cohort that did not. The evaluation demonstrated that the intervention was effective in enabling the great majority of students to achieve better connectivity in thinking, though improvements in overall performance were less significant. Almost all students perceived the intervention to be of value to their learning. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Mapping Concept of Equitable Regional Develoment Using C4.5 Classification Method
AN  - 1443717993
AB  - The concept of data mining has now been developed in various disciplines to conduct excavations on a number of data so as to produce useful new information in the process of decision support. In this study discussed the application of data mining concepts of statistical data in the province of Banten - Indonesia to determine the level of development of an area or district. C.45 classification method used in this study to analyze statistical data and Banten province to develop an equitable application of the concept of web-based regional development. The final results of this study form a concept map applications web-based distribution of development that is able to analyze a number of statistical data that consists of four indicators, namely, human development index, education index, gross domestic income and the population so that applications can be developed to identify the two counties that still require special handling of the provincial government, namely Pandeglang and Lebak. The results of this identification that can be used as a reference for the head area of decision support to determine the future work program in relation to the distribution of development.

T1  - Gendered Risk Perceptions Associated with Human-Wildlife Conflict: Implications for Participatory Conservation
AN  - 1323981320
AB  - This research aims to foster discourse about the extent to which gender is important to consider within the context of participatory approaches for biological conservation. Our objectives are to: (1) gender-disaggregate data about stakeholders' risk perceptions associated with human-wildlife conflict (HWC) in a participatory conservation context, and (2) highlight insights from characterizing gendered similarities and differences in the way people think about HWC-related risks. Two communal conservancies in Caprivi, Namibia served as case study sites. We analyzed data from focus groups (n = 2) to create gendered concept maps about risks to wildlife and livelihoods and any associations of those risks with HWC, and semi-structured interviews (n = 76; men = 38, women = 38) to measure explicit risk attitudes associated with HWC. Concept maps indicated some divergent perceptions in how groups characterized risks to wildlife and livelihoods; however, not only were identified risks to wildlife (e.g., pollution, hunting) dissimilar in some instances, descriptions of risks varied as well. Study groups reported similar risk perceptions associated with HWC with the exception of worry associated with HWC effects on local livelihoods. Gendered differences in risk perceptions may signal different priorities or incentives to participate in efforts to resolve HWC-related risks. Thus, although shared goals and interests may seem to be an obvious reason for cooperative wildlife management, it is not always obvious that management goals are shared. Opportunity exists to move beyond thinking about gender as an explanatory variable for understanding how different groups think about participating in conservation activities.

T1  - Assessment of scientific thinking in basic science in the Iranian second national Olympiad
AN  - 926078838; 22270104
AB  - Abstract

              
Background: To evaluate the scientific reasoning in basic science among undergraduate medical students, we established the National Medical Science Olympiad in Iran. In this Olympiad, the drawing of a concept map was used to evaluate a student's knowledge framework; students' ability in hypothesis generation and testing were also evaluated in four different steps. All medical students were invited to participate in this program. Finally, 133 undergraduate medical students with average grades ≥ 16/20 from 45 different medical schools in Iran were selected. The program took the form of four exams: drawing a concept map (Exam I), hypothesis generation (Exam II), choosing variables based on the hypothesis (Exam III), measuring scientific thought (Exam IV). The examinees were asked to complete all examination items in their own time without using textbooks, websites, or personal consultations. Data were presented as mean ± SE of each parameter. The correlation coefficient between students' scores in each exam with the total final score and average grade was calculated using the Spearman test.

              
Results: Out of a possible score of 200, the mean ± SE of each exam were as follows: 183.88 ± 5.590 for Exam I; 78.68 ± 9.168 for Exam II; 92.04 ± 2.503 for exam III; 106.13 ± 2.345 for Exam IV. The correlation of each exam score with the total final score was calculated, and there was a significant correlation between them (
p  < 0.001). The scatter plot of the data showed a linear correlation between the score for each exam and the total final score. This meant that students with a higher final score were able to perform better in each exam through having drawn up a meaningful concept map.

              
The average grade was significantly correlated with the total final score (R = 0.770), (p  < 0.001). There was also a significant correlation between each exam score and the average grade (p  < 0.001). The highest correlation was observed between Exam I (R  = 0.7708) and the average grade. This means students with higher average grades had better grades in each exam, especially in drawing the concept map.

              
Conclusions: We hope that this competition will encourage medical schools to integrate theory and practice, analyze data, and read research articles. Our findings relate to a selected population, and our data may not be applicable to all medical students. Therefore, further studies are required to validate our results.

T1  - Repertory Grid Analysis And Concept Mapping: Problems And Issues
AN  - 2343805861
AB  - 'Repertory grid analysis' was used as a way of constructing representations of learners conceptions of living things; and finding a common structure or understanding; this was described in previous work. 'Concept mapping' has been stated as an appropriate assessment procedure in science curricula in a number of countries. Previous relevant published work describing the benefits of 'concept mapping' as a learning, teaching, and assessing tool is large. However, the existence of a large literature is not justification in itself, and in this work we provide a critique of the current literature. Problems with 'concept mapping' are simply ignored. However, it is thought that 'repertory grid analysis' does overcome some of the recognized problems of 'concept mapping' such as: i) comparison of concept maps between students or between students and educators: in repertory grid this becomes not only possible but a reliable method - this has proven to be one of the more problematic areas in traditional 'concept mapping'; ii) quantification of concept mapping - integer scoring of whole concept maps in 'repertory grid analysis' is eliminated since the arranged structure of the graph produced holds significance for the conceptual structure. More research needs to be done in repertory grid analysis and its implications and applications in curricular research have yet to be fully explored.

T1  - Structural Patterns And Representation Forms Of University Physics Teachers: Biot-Savart Law And Am-Père’s Law
AN  - 2343726160
AB  - The way teachers organize and transfer their subject matter knowledge has played a crucial role in science education. However, it seems that more attention should be paid on the forms of represen-tation and knowledge organization of teachers that they apply for transferring their knowledge. Therefore, teachers’ knowledge organization and representation forms were investigated with an emphasis on the topics of Biot-Savart law and Ampère’s law. Four physics teachers of introductory-level University who used, concept cards and concept maps were interviewed, and finally an interpretative analysis was performed. The results showed teachers’ knowledge organization was strongly connected only for the topic of Biot-Savart law. Moreover, descriptive and explanatory mathematical models were the most applied forms of representation that teachers used for representing their knowledge. The possibility to recognize the differences in knowledge organization and representation forms of different teachers is the first step towards developing more effective teaching and learning solution.

T1  - Making Concept Maps Useful For Physics Teacher Education: Analysis Of Epistemic Content Of Links
AN  - 2343724965
AB  - In physics teacher education the use of graphical knowledge representation tools like concept maps are abundantly used because they are known to support the formation of organised knowledge. It is widely assumed that certain structural characteristics of concept maps can be connected to the usefulness of content. In order to study this relationship, the concept maps made by pre-service physics teachers are examined here. The design principles of the concept maps are based on quantitative experiments and modelling as the basic procedures in physics concept formation. The epistemic plausibility of justifications written in links is evaluated by using a four-level classification introduced here. The results show that the epistemic analysis of links affects remarkably to the acceptability of knowledge. The advantages of such concept mapping technique in supporting the conceptual understanding in physics teacher education are discussed as well as their usefulness in making plans for teaching.

T1  - Kingston adolescents' knowledge about the social determinants of health: Assessing and addressing the gap
AN  - 1514007471
AB  - Upstream social determinants of health (SDH) have become widely acknowledged as lying at the root of poor health outcomes in Canada and globally. Conditions of social disadvantage restrict access to both social and physical resources, limiting the opportunity to actively pursue a healthy lifestyle. The Commission on the Social Determinants of Health maintains that educating the public about the SDH is a key step towards population health equity. Educating adolescents may be the most efficient and effective route of SDH knowledge dissemination, as youth are in a stage of peak learning, and are also easily reached through health education curriculum delivered in secondary school. However, health curriculum in Ontario is lacking in SDH content, placing a much greater emphasis on individual, lifestyle behaviors, such as diet, physical activity, and sax sex practices. Identifying a gap in SDH knowledge within this population, and evaluating the benefits of SDH education, is required to advocate for health curriculum revision to include SDH material. This project is designed as both a research study and SDH educational intervention. Concept mapping exercises were used to determine students’ knowledge of the determinants of health and the SDH. The impact of short term SDH education on student retention of SDH material was also evaluated. Student concept maps indicated that students attributed their health primarily to physical determinants versus social determinants; 44% of maps contained no SDH content. Statistical analyses prior to delivering the SDH lessons indicated that students’ SDH knowledge varied by their relative socioeconomic status (SES). Post-lesson analyses indicated however that student SDH knowledge increased significantly, and final levels of SDH knowledge following the SDH lessons was unaffected by socio-demographic variables. Findings suggest that 1) there is an SDH knowledge gap in the adolescent population, 2) an inequity in adolescent SDH knowledge exists across socio-economic factors, and 3) that SDH education can potentially eliminate the inequity in SDH knowledge. Current Ontario health curriculum requires revision to include SDH material. Designing curricula to have an optimal influence on both student learning and adolescent health requires greater communication and collaboration from both educational institutions and health agencies in Canada

T1  - United States evaluation policy: A theoretical taxonomy
AN  - 1513556541
AB  - Efforts are currently underway in the US federal context to improve and strengthen evaluation practice and increase the use of evaluation results to inform policies and programs. However, these efforts remain unrealized, due partly to the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework that views evaluation and related organizational processes and institutions as part of a larger system. Early intuitive theoretical taxonomies of evaluation policy suffer from the lack of connection to specific examples and instances, and are missing clear classification criteria that would allow practical application. To generate a grounded taxonomy of evaluation policy, this study surveyed members of the American Evaluation Association in 2009, asking them to generate examples of evaluation policy, and then to sort and rate these suggested policies. Results are analyzed using the concept mapping method of Trochim (1989), which first translates aggregate sorting decisions into conceptual “distances” on a two-dimensional dot map, then uses hierarchical cluster analysis to generate groupings of ideas. These groupings become the foundation for categories in a theoretical taxonomy. Findings reveal several different dimensions by which participants grouped evaluation policies, including the dimensions of “value” and “policy mechanism.” A values-by-mechanisms taxonomy and instructions for its use in an evaluation policy inventory process are proposed.

T1  - Web Approach for Ontology-Based Classification, Integration, and Interdisciplinary Usage of Geoscience Metadata
AN  - 1463087453
AB  - The Semantic Web is a W3C approach that integrates the different sources of semantics within documents and services using ontology-based techniques. The main objective of this approach in the geoscience domain is the improvement of understanding, integration, and usage of Earth and space science related web content in terms of data, information, and knowledge for machines and people. The modeling and representation of semantic attributes and relations within and among documents can be realized by human readable concept maps and machine readable OWL documents. The objectives for the usage of the Semantic Web approach in the GFZ data center ISDC project are the design of an extended classification of metadata documents for product types related to instruments, platforms, and projects as well as the integration of different types of metadata related to data product providers, users, and data centers. Sources of content and semantics for the description of Earth and space science product types and related classes are standardized metadata documents (e.g., DIF documents), publications, grey literature, and Web pages. Other sources are information provided by users, such as tagging data and social navigation information. The integration of controlled vocabularies as well as folksonomies plays an important role in the design of well formed ontologies.

T1  - Education for Sustainable Development: Experiences from Action Research with Science Teachers
AN  - 1367794769
AB  - This study reports on Egyptian science teachers' experiences in collective action research projects with a focus on education for sustainable development (ESD). Science teachers were enrolled in a study course "Teaching Strategies" that had been revised with a focus on sustainability. The course was introduced in the spring semester of the academic year 2011/2012. Throughout the course, 29 teachers worked in groups to develop projects that promote sustainable development through classroom teaching practices that encourage involvement with local communities around school premises. The framework that guided the study was based on experiential, constructivist and transformative learning theories known collectively as 'ExConTra'. A mixed methods methodology was used where teachers' responses to three open-ended reflective questions produced qualitative data that were analysed by identifying themes and patterns. The author developed two quantitative instruments: a Concept Mapping Rubric and a Sustainable Development Questionnaire. The former was to probe the cognitive organisation participants had in relation to the concept of sustainable development before and after developing the action research projects. The latter instrument was used to identify participants' attitudes towards teaching for ESD and their knowledge of classroom pedagogical practices. Statistical data analysis using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences indicates that teachers in their post-tests had developed: better cognitive organisation for the concept of sustainable development; positive attitudes towards teaching for sustainable development and ESD classroom teaching practices. Involvement in the action research projects where teachers were experiencing, reflecting, conceptualising, constructing, acting and transforming within the context of ESD may be responsible for these results where there are promises to help achieve successful implementation to include ESD in science education.

T1  - A methodology for modeling healthcare teams and an evaluation of Business Process Modeling Notation as a Modeling Language
AN  - 1355737257
AB  - Whether it is offering services, delivering solutions or driving innovations, team work has been a hallmark of efficiency and effectiveness in various industries. The healthcare industry is not left out as its service delivery process involves numerous interfaces, information flows and patient hand-offs among professionals with different educational training, differing knowledge levels and possibly working from different locations as well.   As healthcare delivery evolves to being more patient-centered, so does the team settings as well, becoming more collaborative. Such changes also translate into a need for support systems to evolve to be able to provide support for the extent of collaboration that would be needed. A framework is needed to guide in the development of such systems. However, due to the varying needs of patients, team types and make-up would generally differ, so we explored the different types of team settings studying what they entail based on their various degrees of collaboration.   We therefore present in this thesis a model of team based concepts, an ontology formalizing the model, team based scenarios designed using the ontology and then application of the scenarios to test the ability of BPMN (Business Process Modeling Notation) to model healthcare teams.

T1  - Sequential Pattern Analysis: Method and Application in Exploring How Students Develop Concept Maps
AN  - 1288341648
AB  - Concept mapping is a technique that represents knowledge in graphs. It has been widely adopted in science education and cognitive psychology to aid learning and assessment. To realize the sequential manner in which students develop concept maps, most research relies upon human-dependent, qualitative approaches. This article proposes a method for sequential pattern analysis, inspired by sequential pattern mining algorithms generally applied to commercial forecast and decision supports. The method can be programmed for automatic execution and thus reasonably fast, yielding reproducible results. To validate the proposed method, 187 college students were recruited to create respective concept maps on a computerized concept mapping system. While the concept mapping data was analyzed by the sequential pattern analysis method, it was found that the mapping sequences used by students that created superior concept maps were similar and had a pattern in which propositions were formed in a temporal order from more inclusive to less inclusive. Conversely, no similarity was found in the concept mapping sequences by those who created inferior concept maps. The findings support theoretical expectations about concept mapping and are consistent with qualitative evidence based on student self-reports.

T1  - A Concept-Map Integrated Dynamic Assessment System for Improving Ecology Observation Competences in Mobile Learning Activities
AN  - 1288341646
AB  - Observation competence plays a fundamental role in outdoor scientific investigation. The computerized concept mapping technique as a Mindtool has shown the potential for enhancing meaningful learning in science education. The purposes of the present study are to develop a concept map integrated mobile learning design for ecology observation and to examine the implementation effect for elementary school children. Also, the difference in growth slopes between gifted and average students is investigated. Eighteen gifted students and thirty average students were included in this study. A computerized dynamic assessment system which combines a Computerized Ecology Observation Competence Assessment (CEOCA) and a concept map integrated ecology observation learning design were implemented. The results of the hierarchical linear model (HLM) analysis reveal that the overall growth slope is significant (μ=0.27, p<.01). The effect size is 0.53. The growth slope of the gifted students is a little higher than that of the average students. However, the slope difference between ability groups is not significant. The results suggest that a well designed concept map integrated learning system demonstrates very promising potential for enhancing both the gifted and average students' mobile observation competence. The system developed in this study could be a useful resource for elementary school outdoor learning design.

T1  - The Impact of Recurrent On-line Synchronous Scientific Argumentation on Students?Argumentation and Conceptual Change
AN  - 1287024890
AB  - This study reports the impact of Recurrent On-Line Synchronous Scientific Argumentation learning on 8th grade students’ scientific argumentation ability and conceptual change involving physical science. The control group (N=76) were recruited to receive conventional instruction whereas the experimental group (N=74) received the Recurrent On-Line Synchronous Scientific Argumentation program for about 25 physical science class periods of 45 minutes each, which is about one third of the physical science class periods in a semester. Results indicate that the experimental group significantly outperformed the conventional group on the post-Physical Science Conception Test and the Physical Science Dependent Argumentation Test. The quantity and quality of scientific arguments that the experimental group’s students generated, in a series of pre- and post-argumentation questions, all improved across the seven topics. In addition, the experimental group’s students successfully constructed more correct conceptions from pre- to post-argumentation questions across the seven topics. This clearly demonstrates that the experimental group’s students’ argumentation ability and conceptual change were both facilitated through receiving the Recurrent On-Line Synchronous Scientific Argumentation program.

T1  - Concept mapping for planning and evaluation of a community-based initiative
AN  - 1284159171
AB  - Community-based initiatives address community issues by providing a multi-agency approach to prevention and intervention services (Connell et al.,1995). When incorporating multiple agencies, it can be challenging to obtain multiple perspectives and gaining consensus on the priorities and direction for these initiatives. This study employed a participatory approach called concept mapping to build consensus amongst stakeholder groups in a victims' assistance program. This multiple-method technique provided visual representations of the findings assessing community initiative providers' perceptions of barriers to accessing victim's assistance services for children and families who experience or witness violence or trauma. Visualizations organized findings into interpretable groups of statements to label and provide actionable next steps for community initiative providers. Several results of interest emerged from this study. First, there are varying community and system facets that providers perceive to be barriers to children's and families' access to care; some are within the trauma provider system of care whereas other barriers are perpetuated within the community. In addition, stakeholders rated barriers based on their prevalence and capacity to change within the community. Average ratings varied by cluster, with distrust of the trauma-informed system of care as the most prevalent barrier and workforce development as the barrier noted as the easiest to change. Stakeholder group ratings for prevalence of all clusters were higher for program staff than from law enforcement officers and mental health providers whereas ratings for capacity to change were in greater agreement between stakeholder groups overall. Moreover, program staff noted that the concept mapping process and visualizations provided them with a means to discuss actionable steps with community-based initiative providers of the victim's assistance program as a whole.

T1  - Using Concept Mapping to Identify Action Steps for Physical Activity Promotion in Cancer Treatment
AN  - 1113335366
AB  - The benefits of exercise during and after cancer treatment represent research areas that have received increased attention throughout the past two decades. Numerous benefits have been observed for cancer survivors who are physically active (Speck, Courneya, Masse, Duval & Schmitz, 2010). Yet oncologists have been slow to incorporate exercise counseling into practice (Daley et al., 2007). The objective of this study was to gather input from both researchers and oncologists as to what needs to happen for exercise to become part of standard care once treatment ends. The concept mapping process developed by Trochim and Kane (2007) was utilized to realize this goal. A total of 37 unique ideas were produced by participants and were grouped into six-clusters: “Education,” “Inclusion of Exercise Professionals,” “Changes within the Current Oncology Environment,” “Research,” “Needed Components of Exercise Programs,” and “Patient Focused.” Each of these clusters represents an area of concentration where changes are suggested for further promotion of PA for cancer survivors. Participants also rated each idea on its importance and feasibility. The “Education” cluster included many of the ideas that were rated highly on both of these variables and as such may serve as an ideal starting point for increasing cancer survivors’ exercise levels. Additionally, results revealed differences between researchers and oncologists with regard to how they ranked the ideas in terms of importance and feasibility.

T1  - The Use of Concept Mapping/Pattern Matching to Determine the Content Domain for Information Literacy in Baccalaureate Education
AN  - 1098093678
AB  - This study assessed the relevance of a national association’s standards for developing information literacy competency in undergraduate students at a mid-sized, regional university in Maryland. Key stakeholders responsible for ensuring student success in achieving information literacy competency at the institution were solicited for their expertise to identify the outcomes they consider to indicate information literacy competency. The group of 14 participants included six faculty, three librarians, three student affairs professionals, and two students. Trochim’s Concept Mapping/Pattern Matching methodology was used for gathering and analyzing the data to conceptualize the domain of information literacy competencies. The key stakeholders generated 80 student learning outcomes for information literacy. Using multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analysis, the outcomes were grouped into eight clusters representing the content domain for information literacy. Following the creation of the concept maps, the resulting priorities and their conceptualization schema were compared to the national organization’s standards for similarities and differences in a qualitative document analysis. They were also compared to the learning outcomes for information literacy currently associated with the institution’s general education curriculum and the library’s instruction program.    The study revealed four conclusions. First, the national standards for information literacy are relevant at the local level. Second, there is a need for academic libraries to reevaluate their existing information literacy outcomes to reflect changes in information dissemination from a textual bias to include multi-media. Third, it is important for academic institutions to include representation of all stakeholders when developing student learning outcomes. Fourth, ambiguity still exists among stakeholders in regard to the effectiveness of teaching information literacy.

T1  - Mapping expert supervisors' cognitions
AN  - 1039146973
AB  - Since the essential role of counseling supervision for counselor growth and effectiveness was emphasized in several seminal articles in the 1980s (Blocher, 1983; Loganbill, Hardy, & Delworth, 1982), many researchers have investigated the complex factors involved in effective counseling supervision. However, within this large body of work, very few researchers have sought to describe the master, or expert, supervisor.   When researchers have studied supervisors, typically participants were supervisors under training and relatively inexperienced supervisors (Borders & Fong, 1994; Luke, Ellis, & Bernard, 2011). Very few researchers have studied more experienced supervisors (Nelson, Barnes, Evans, & Triggiano, 2008). Although these studies were informative, none were focused on expert supervisors. Thus, an investigation of expert supervisors is considered to be crucial for furthering our understanding of effective counseling supervision practices as well as improving supervisor training efforts.   Hence, the specific focus of this study was to explore expert supervisors' cognitions and cognitive structures through a mixed-method approach called concept mapping. Data were obtained through three rounds of data collection. In the first round, participants generated statements through an open-ended internet survey. In the second round, the researcher mailed out the edited and synthesized statements to participants for the sorting and rating tasks. In the third round, an online focus group session was conducted with a subgroup of participants. A total of 18 expert supervisors completed at least one round of data collection procedure.    Expert supervisors generated 479 statements, or cognitions/thoughts, regarding their thinking while they were planning for, conducting, and evaluating their supervision sessions. These statements were edited and synthesized into a final set of 195. Analyses and the focus group session resulted in summarizing these statements into 25 clusters or cognitive categories/domains. These cognitive categories/domains indicated that expert supervisors' thinking involved many different supervision components. Supervision Models, such as the Discrimination Model (Bernard & Goodyear, 2009), Developmental Models (Stoltenberg, 1981; Loganbill et al., 1982), and the Systems Approach to Supervision Model (Holloway, 1995), were represented in the results of the present study. However, the representation of these models was at the statement level and none of the cognitive categories/domains were named after these models.   Furthermore, five separate but related regions appeared on the cluster map based on the conceptual similarities of these cognitive categories/domains. These regions were Assessment of the Supervisee and His/Her Work, Supervisory Relationship, Supervisor Self-Assessment and Reflection, Conceptualization of Supervision and Intervening, and Administration Considerations.   Lastly, expert supervisors appeared to be giving more importance or higher priority to almost all of the cognitive categories while they were working with challenging supervisees when compared to easy supervisees. Expert supervisors' ratings also indicated that "Supervisee Development," "The Client and the Counseling Session," and "Supervisor's Goal Setting/Agenda Setting" clusters were in the higher importance/priority list for both easy and challenging supervisees.   The findings of the present study provide direction for future research and useful implications for supervisors and supervisor training programs.

T1  - Relationships between concept mapping and critical thinking skills of vocational nursing students
AN  - 1034591534
AB  - The task of developing vocational nursing students' critical thinking abilities is one of the greatest challenges facing nurse educators today. Licensed vocational nurses (LVNs) must be trained to think critically in order to provide safe patient care. Due to the expanded role and functions in the LVN's scope of practice, LVNs are making more complex decisions than ever before. The purpose of this study was to investigate concept mapping as a teaching strategy and the extent to which concept mapping impacts students' critical thinking skills and academic performance. A convenience sample of the entire enrollment of medical-surgical nursing course vocational nursing students (n = 33) participated in this quantitative descriptive study. Subjects completed two questionnaires: the California Critical Thinking Skills Test (Facione & Facione, 2000) to measure their critical thinking skills; and the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (Facione & Facione, 1992) to measure their dispositions to think critically. Researcher created a demographic data form to collect gender, age, educational status, and academic level completed in the nursing program. Subjects' concept mapping grades were accessed for comparison with survey data. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Pearson correlation, and t test. No difference in CCTST posttest scores are found between vocational nursing students' CCTST pretest scores. Overall, nursing students had high concept mapping scores, which are associated with increased critical thinking skills. Survey data supported a correlation between CCTDI posttest scores and concept mapping scores when compared to CCTDI pretest scores. Participants' dispositions toward critical thinking were positively correlated with the written achievement on concept maps as an increase in critical thinking skills. Findings from this study have implications for practice and vocational nursing education, and they support recommendations for future research. Critical thinking skills and dispositions to think critically can have a critical impact on whether an LVN is capable of practicing competently and safely in situations that involve clinical decision making in long-term care facilities, home-healthcare agencies, and other expanded roles of the licensed vocational nurse.

T1  - Employment of an Informal Educational Mathematical Facility to Lower Math Anxiety and Improve Teacher and Student Attitudes Towards Understanding Mathematics
AN  - 1033342269
AB  - Students do not pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, or mathematics (STEM) because of a lack of ability, but rather a lack of positive experiences with mathematics. Research has concluded that attitudes in math directly influence success in mathematics. As many as 75% of high school graduates in the United States suffer from mild to severe forms of math anxiety. The improvement of student achievement in mathematics in the United States lags behind that of many other nations in the world. Efforts to improve student achievement in mathematics have focused on developing effective teachers and teaching practices, creating state and national standards, and raising test scores. Advances in neuroscience and understanding how the brain learns mathematics are often not reflected in current instructional practices, and being "bad at math" is not viewed as a problem by American society. As a response to the current state of mathematics in the United States, the researcher created an informal educational center to provide positive mathematical experiences that demonstrate how math works. The Metamo4ic Math Center opened in 2007.     This study investigated the effectiveness of a two-hour field trip visit to the Math Center on 114 elementary students, six teachers, and 42 preservice teachers. A Math Anxiety Scale - Revised (MAS-R) and knowledge concept map were administered to treatment and control groups pre-visit, post-visit, and post-post visit. Interviews were conducted pre and post visit. In addition, an independent evaluator observed each field trip visit.     The results of the study indicated that the Math Center does significantly lessen anxiety and reduce negative attitudes toward mathematics in elementary students and their teachers. Although pre-service teachers demonstrated a lessening in anxiety, the decrease was not significant, and the results demonstrated that the pre-service teachers in both the treatment and control groups had anxiety levels significantly higher than the student and in-service teacher groups. This study led the researcher to conclude that a "Cycle of Anxiety" is contagious and continually perpetuated through the current instruction of mathematics. This study indicated that efforts to improve math achievement void of addressing negative attitudes and math anxiety might not be successful.

T1  - Empirical Evidence of the Effectiveness of Concept Mapping as a Learning Intervention for Nuclear Medicine Technology Students in a Distance Learning Radiation Protection and Biology Course
AN  - 913588247; 22080436
AB  - Metacognitive learning strategies are based on instructional learning theory, which promotes deep, meaningful learning. Educators in a baccalaureate-level nuclear medicine technology program demonstrated that students enrolled in an online, distance learning section of an introductory radiation protection and radiobiology course performed better when traditional instruction was supplemented with nontraditional metacognitive learning strategies.

              
The metacognitive learning strategy that was used is best known as concept mapping. The concept map, in addition to the standard homework problem assignment and opportunity for question-answer sessions, became the template for misconception identification and remediation interactions between the instructor and the student. The control group relied on traditional homework problems and question-answer sessions alone. Because students in both the "treatment" groups (i.e., students who used concept mapping) and the control group were distance learning students, all personal communications were conducted via e-mail or telephone. The final examination of the course was used to facilitate a quantitative comparison of the performance of students who used concept mapping and the performance of students who did not use concept mapping.

              
The results demonstrated a significantly higher median final examination score for the concept mapping group than for the non-concept mapping group (z = -2.0381, P = 0.0415), with an appropriately large effect size (2.65).

              
Concept mapping is a cognitive learning intervention that effectively enables meaningful learning and is suitable for use in the independent learner-oriented distance learning environments used by some nuclear medicine technology programs.

T1  - Effect of nanotechnology instructions on senior high school students
AN  - 1955058219
AB  - In this research, we cooperate with senior high school teachers to understand current nanotechnology model of senior high school nanotechnology curriculum in Taiwan. Then design senior high school nanotechnology (nanotech) curriculum to teach 503 senior high school students. After teaching the nano-tech curriculum we use the "Nanotechnology problem situation questionnaire" to measurement their learning. The results showed: 1. Senior high school nanotechnology curriculum tends to introduce nanotechnology phenomenon we meet in daily life to students, the teachers explain which science lesson related to the curriculum and sum up the nanotechnology principle of the nanotechnology product in the end. 2. We receive 453 valid nanotechnology problem situation questionnaires (recoveries about 90.1%). Analyze the questionnaires, we found out around 17.89~27.59% of senior high school students can answer the contexts they learn in the nanotech curriculum lesson, but the concept is incomplete; the other 43.26% to 53.99% students have alternative conceptions, they use their own experiences from daily life to finish the questionnaires which might be incorrect. 3. Some of the students have inveterate alternative concept which senior high school teacher thinks these alternative concepts might change when teacher conduct students to join a nano-tech science fair competition. In the competition, student needs to do the experiment and presentation all by themselves which can establish the right nano-tech concept for them. 4. Collecting all kinds of students' answers in the questionnaires, we can analyze their alternative conceptions to compile senior high school nanotechnology conception diagnostic test, which can do a comprehensive test and use it as designing nanoscience curriculum reference documents.

T1  - Concept Mapping As A Learning Tool For The Employment Relations Degree
AN  - 1418218965
AB  - Concept mapping is a technique to represent relationships between concepts that can help students to improve their meaningful learning. Using the cognitive theories proposed by Ausubel (1968), concept maps can help instructors and students to enhance their logical thinking and study skills by revealing connections among concepts that can simplify all the new concepts that can be introduced in a subject during any subject classes of a semester. In this paper a study is made for the introduction of this technique in the subject Business Management Principles as part of the Employment Relations Degree. The main objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of concept mapping on the learning acquired by the students. For this purpose we use data with the evolution of qualifications of students as the items that show how a planned way of introducing new concepts (relating with concepts that students already have) can be very useful in college teaching. Therefore this paper analyzes within a specific context the way in which concept maps are constructed to reflect student's knowledge and facilitate their sense-making and improve their meaningful learning.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Computational Expertise in Engineering: Aligning Workforce Computing Needs with Computer Science Concepts
AN  - 2317744873
AB  - Computational Expertise in Engineering: From Industry to Academia – and Back Again.Aligning workforce computing needs with computer science concepts.Claudia E. Vergara, Mark Urban-Lurain, Abdol-Hossein Esfahanian, Daina Briedis, Neeraj Buch, CindeeDresen, Kysha Frazier, Louise Paquette, Thomas F. Wolff, Jon Sticklen Computational skills required to solve disciplinary problems form a key skill set forengineering graduates. Generalizing from the specific computational skills to the mindset ofcomputational thinking enables engineering graduates to see and apply general principles ofcomputation within their discipline. Globalization, international competition, an increasinglydiverse population, and a rapid growth in computational capabilities and infrastructure are someof the factors faced by institutions of higher education. To respond to these challengesinnovation, dynamism and flexibility in curriculum design based on employer input and programquality improvement principles are necessary [1]. The Collaborative Process to Align Computing Education with Engineering WorkforceNeeds (CPACE) project team addresses these challenges in the context of computationalcompetencies in the engineering disciplines. We developed a partnership among a variety ofstakeholders – post secondary educators represented by and and business, industry and community leaders represented by – to identify thecomputational skills that are essential for a 21st century engineering workforce. Our objective isto revise the undergraduate engineering curricula to address computational problem-solvingcompetencies that are aligned with industry needs and that enable students to integrateconceptual knowledge, technical skills and professional practice. Based on the results of employer interviews and employee surveys we analyzed industryneeds for computational competence both at the practical-tool level and at the computationalthinking level [2, 3]. In this paper we present the results from unpacking the fundamentalcomputer science (CS) concepts from interview and survey data with employers and employees.Since the computational skills identified can be specialized to particular disciplines, industries, oreven companies, we focused on finding common threads in the broad engineering context. Tohelp us identify and map these common threads to CS concepts we drew on the informationtechnology concepts enumerated in the Fluency with Information Technology (FITness)framework [4]. Operationally our mapping process engaged members of the research team doinga mapping on their own, followed by a group discussion to reach a consensus mapping. The chartbelow shows the distribution of the industry data across these computer science concepts. We are using this data-to-CS-concept mapping as a framework to implement curricularrevision in two test-bed programs at (Figure) . Our goal is to better align thecomputational capabilities of students graduating from our engineering programs with the needsof industrial stakeholders. To accomplish this, we are mapping the concepts across all four yearsof the engineering curricula beginning with two engineering disciplines, Chemical and Civil, at and pre-engineering courses at . Our objective is to introducea series of authentic engineering problems developed in consultation with stakeholders fromindustry, employees, and faculty from engineering disciplines to ensure that the problems arerepresentative of engineering practice, disciplinary context, and computing concepts. Theseproblems provide a context where students are required to apply the various computationalconcepts for their solution.

T1  - Topic Maps Used to Present Interrelationships in Dynamic Linear Systems
AN  - 2317744057
AB  - Topic Maps Used to Present Interrelationships in Dynamic Linear SystemsThe study of Linear Physical Systems is unusual among topics in Engineering in that there is arich interplay among the topics and there is no natural order in which to present the material. Weuse topic maps to emphasize these interrelationships without imposing an arbitrary hierarchy onthe material presented. For example, in terms of types of systems, mechanical systems can betaught first, or electrical. In terms of transforms, Laplace can be taught first, or Fourier, or eventhe Z-transform. There are also many relationships between topics. Examples include thetransforms mentioned previously, the different types of physical system (electrical, mechanical,thermal…), and different solution methods such as state-space and transfer functions. By theirvery nature textbooks must present, and follow, a linear path through the material, and any twotextbooks may follow very different paths. Web-based presentation of the material removes partof this problem because the material need not be presented linearly, but raises the prospect of achaotic portrayal of the subjects because HTML links are merely from text to text and have noinherent meaning.Another way to present such interrelated ideas is through the use of topic maps. Topic maps areused to represent these interrelationships using topics (concepts), associations (the relationshipsbetween topics) and occurrences (information, e.g., web pages, relating to the topics). This isdistinct from concept maps and other commonly used visual methods for organizing informationin that the ideas need not be hierarchical; for example Fourier Transforms are not a subset ofLaplace Transforms (or vice-versa) as is presented in most textbooks. In addition the topics havecertain roles in the association that give the link meaning, a clear advantage over traditionalHTML hyperlinks and other methods.We have developed a system using HTML and JavaScript and XML that allows for the authoringand graphical visualization of topic maps. When visualizing a map, a topic is selected (byclicking on it), and all related topics are displayed around it. Included in the display are theassociations and roles played by each topic in that association. Topics can also have otherinformation (occurrences in the form of HTML links, simulations…) that give explanatory detailabout the topic, including descriptions of how it is related to other, associated, topics. Whilemany textbooks (and even web-based presentations) have only short sections describing theinterrelationships between topics, this system puts the relationship at the core of the presentationof the material so students can more easily grasp why they are learning particular topics, andhow it fits into the larger context of linear systems.

T1  - The Impact of Professional Development on Teachers Integrating Engineering into Science and Mathematics Classroom
AN  - 2317742005
AB  - The Impact of Professional Development on Teachers Integrating Engineering into Science and Mathematics ClassroomEducators are mobilizing at the national and state level to meet the need to increase students’ interest andachievement in STEM. Minnesota, Texas, Oregon, and Massachusetts have recently legislated efforts toimprove STEM education through the addition of engineering standards to the existing science standardsin order to support improving quality in K-12 STEM education as well as increase the pathways forstudents to pursue STEM degrees and careers. Integration of engineering into science and mathematicsrequires a shift in current educational practices. The majority of K-12 science teachers lack knowledgeand experience of engineering and engineering education and how to treat STEM teaching as aninterdisciplinary endeavor. Therefore, in order to provide the quality and meaningful educational reformin both science and mathematics education, training teachers on the implementation of these standards isa greater need now more than ever. The purpose of this research is to understand and identify the way inwhich science and mathematics teachers that participated in the STEM integration teacher professionaldevelopment program implement engineering standards in their classroom. The questions that guide thisresearch are as follows: 1) What are teachers’ understandings of engineering? and 2) How do teacherspractice integrating engineering into their science and mathematic teaching?Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics professional development program (STEM PD) wasa five day training that spread throughout the 2009-2010 academic year, with four 1-hour ProfessionalLearning Community (PLC) sessions between each training day. The participants in the STEM PD weremiddle and high school teachers. Overall, the goal for the STEM professional development program wasto help teachers develop STEM contexts in order to teach mathematics and science more effectively andhelp teacher develop deeper understanding of the subjects they teach through the lens of STEMintegration. The data collection of STEM PD involved both formative and summative data collection.The summative data collection focused on measuring teachers’ knowledge of the process of science andengineering content in the modules. The summative data collection included teachers’ self-efficacy ofteaching science/mathematics within engineering context survey, pre and post engineering concept map,and pre and post engineering design cycle survey. The formative data include STEM lesson plans andSTEM activity posters. The following is a sample of some of the data and results from our study.A Paired Samples T-test was conducted to compare teachers’ self-efficacy of teachingscience/mathematics and underlying perceptions of STEM activities impacted on teachers’implementation of science/ mathematics teaching and student learning. Five items showed significantlyimprovement in pre- and post-test. As for the pre and post engineering design cycle, the result showedsignificant improvement. Participants had clearer ideas what elements an engineer uses to solveproblems (Pre-test: M=1.47, SD=0.573, Post-test: M=2.127, SD=0.579; t(54)=-7.216, p<.001) after theSTEM PD.Overall, after participated in the STEM PD, the teachers increase their confidence level of integratingengineering context into their science/mathematics teaching. Teachers also believed that integratingengineering helps they teach science/mathematics in a more effective way and can enhance theirunderstanding of how scientific/mathematics knowledge is developed.  This indicates that teachersconsider integrating engineering into their lesson plans very valuable to their science/mathematicsteaching.

T1  - The Use of Concept Mapping to Structure a Conceptual Foundation for Secondary Level Engineering Education
AN  - 2317740504
AB  - Numerous K-12 engineering initiatives have emerged across the U.S (Brophy, Klein, Portsmore,& Rogers, 2008). These initiatives have generated considerable interest within the STEMeducation community and beyond. Potential positive outcomes include enhanced studentachievement, increased awareness of engineering, and increased levels of technological literacy(Katehi, Pearson, & Feder, 2009). However, a recent study (authors) of engineering-orientedteacher professional development projects detected some significant concerns. One disturbingfinding was the lack of a well-defined concept base. In the absence of a conceptual foundation,pre-collegiate level engineering tends to focus on engaging design-based activities without anappropriate grounding in content, which poses serious problems for curriculum and professionaldevelopment, assessment, and standards development.The session will present the results of two studies designed to address this void. The first studywas designed to identify and refine a set of core engineering concepts appropriate for secondarylevel engineering. The concepts were derived from a process that included an examination ofhistorical and philosophical literature, curriculum materials, and standards documents as well asfocus group sessions with engineering educators and practicing engineers. This generated anextensive set of themes, which were analyzed using three operationally defined criteria: core,engineering, and concept. The process yielded thirteen core engineering concepts (e.g., design,constraints, efficiency, optimization, etc.). The study also identified important issues includingontological implications, engineering’s social context and pedagogical implications.Subsequent to this study, a second study was conducted to further refine the outcomes of theinitial study. Specifically, the study was designed to better understand the nature of the concepts,particularly the structure of and interrelationship among the concepts. The study examined theuse of engineering concept maps to probe the connections among concepts. Concept mapsprovide a visual depiction of the knowledge structure of a concept and have been shown to be apowerful and psychometrically sound tool for assessing conceptual change (Markham &Mintzes, 1994). The objectives were to refine the concept base, map the relationships among theengineering concepts, and cross-map of the engineering concept maps with existing analyses ofconcepts in science and technology (AAAS 1993, National Science Standards, and ITEA, 2000).As with the initial study, the process began with an extensive review of the literature focused onconcept mapping. Particular attention was given to their use as a tool for understanding andstructuring concepts. We were also interested in learning more about how concept mapping canbe used as an assessment tool to measure levels and complexity of students’ conceptualunderstanding.Based on the assumption that conceptual understandings evolve from the rich experience andexpertise of a community of practitioners (in this case, the engineering community), a focusgroup comprised of science, technology, and engineering education experts, cognitive scientists,and secondary science and technology teachers was convened to explore the use of conceptmapping of the engineering concepts.The session will present an overview of understandings derived from the study, including thepotential use of concept mapping for promoting and assessing the understanding of engineeringconcepts.

T1  - A Heuristic to Aid Teaching, Learning, and Problem-Solving for Mechanics of Materials
AN  - 2317739784
AB  - A HEURISTIC TO AID TEACHING, LEARNING AND PROBLEM-SOLVING FOR MECHANICS OF MATERIALSThe Mechanics of Materials course is fundamental to all areas of solid engineering mechanics. Itis a required course in such programs as Mechanical, Civil, Naval Architecture and MarineEngineering, Industrial, Chemical, and Biomedical Engineering. It often functions as a decision-provoking course, whereby students determine whether or not they persist in majoring inengineering or choose to exit engineering as a major. The course is generally considered“difficult” by students; although the math required is not particularly advanced, the content andvocabulary (unchanged in practice for decades) are new to students. Educators across severalengineering disciplines over the past few decades have attempted to improve learning through avariety of efforts such as: (a) development of physical demonstration models for classroom use,(b) development of computer programs to assist, encourage and facilitate independent learningby students, (c) concept inventory studies to uncover the underlying cause of learning thecontent, (d) development of active learning strategies for use in the classroom, (e) project-basedtasks for students to learn by doing and (f) peer teaching/learning. Among our own efforts toimprove learning, we observed that students often miss the global connections of the many topicsin the course, that students get “lost” in the midst of problem solutions, and that students havedifficulty storing their knowledge in their memories. All too often, we have known brightstudents who were unsuccessful in recalling basic problems only a few weeks after completingthe course. Through our multi-year efforts, our goal is to help students make the concept andproblem-solving connections using somewhat basic sketches they can recreate from memorysimply using paper and pencil. In this paper we describe a basic concept map developed atUSCGA to use as an instructional aide which organizes the problem-solving process whileshowing the “big picture” components of the whole course. Our work began by having studentsdevelop their personal concept maps as a means to learn or to demonstrate their understanding ofthe course content. Those activities revealed a road-block to use as instructional aides for avariety of reasons. First, the personal concept maps were so personal that the instructor had tointerview virtually every student to uncover the intended meaning. Second, the personal mapsshowed so little commonality that they were not useful in facilitating communication amongstudents. Most importantly, student concept maps did not show the global connection of alltopics taught in the course and the problem-solving process, which was a primary goal of ours.Therefore, we created a “common” concept map which we use to teach and review Mechanics ofMaterials. This map has become a focal point for class lecture and tutoring. It is sufficientlysimple so that anyone could re-create its basics as a hand-drawn sketch. In this paper, we presenta literature review, we include the “common concept map”, we detail several ways in whichwe’ve used the heuristic, and finally describe preliminary results assessing its efficacy.

T1  - Security education in Singapore: A study of knowledge structures in electronic security technology
AN  - 858399066
AB  - The development of understanding in the discipline of security science is just beginning. As the academic research on defining the domain of security science continues, so does the development of learning security-related concepts in the understanding of the knowledge structure. This study has considered a methodology for the portrayal of knowledge structures in the domain of electronic security and its associated concepts. It seeks to examine the understanding of novice learners' perceptions of electronic security concepts through the knowledge structure approach. The multi-dimensional scaling technique has been applied to dissimilarity measures on a selection of concepts from the domain of electronic security. These concepts were considered as key ideas in the learning of electronic security. The formal knowledge structure for electronic security concepts was mapped for an expert group that was most familiar with the understanding of this domain of security science. In addition, two student groups from the Singapore Institute of Technical Education participated in the study, and produced concept maps for the same electronic security concepts. The structures of the novice groups when compared to the expert group lacked the definition of clusters of related concepts, and were interpreted as lacking the understanding of experts in this knowledge domain.

T1  - Exploring Novel Tools for Assessing High School Students' Meaningful Understanding of Organic Reactions
AN  - 851964419
AB  - Systemic assessment questions (SAQs) are novel assessment tools used in the context of the Systemic Approach to Teaching and Learning (SATL) model. The purpose of this model is to enhance students' meaningful understanding of scientific concepts by use of constructivist concept mapping procedures, which emphasize the development of systems thinking. In this study, we preliminarily investigated whether specific SAQs forms are potentially valid and reliable tools for assessing 11th grade Greek high school students' meaningful understanding of organic reactions. Thus, we designed and comparatively tested two "fill-in-the blank" SAQs with specific characteristics, differing in their degree of directedness, their cognitive demands, and their systemic diagrams' complexity. The results indicated that SAQs under study have acceptable validity and reliability as evaluation tools for 11th grade high school students. Additionally, the SAQ form that incorporates a more complex systemic diagram and is "less-directed" and more demanding for the examinees was found to be more appropriate for capturing students' meaningful understanding of organic reactions.

T1  - Mapping biological ideas: Concept maps as knowledge integration tools for evolution education
AN  - 928947890
AB  - Many students leave school with a fragmented understanding of biology that does not allow them to connect their ideas to their everyday lives (Wandersee, 1989; Mintzes, Wandersee, & Novak, 1998; Mintzes, Wandersee, & Novak, 2000a). Understanding evolution ideas is seen as central to building an integrated knowledge of biology (Blackwell, Powell, & Dukes, 2003; Thagard & Findlay, 2010). However, the theory of evolution has been found difficult to understand as it incorporates a wide range of ideas from different areas (Bahar et al., 1999; Tsui & Treagust, 2003) and multiple interacting levels (Wilensky & Resnick, 1999; Duncan & Reiser, 2007; Hmelo-Silver et al., 2007). Research suggests that learners can hold a rich repertoire of co-existing alternative ideas of evolution (for example, Bishop & Anderson, 1990; Demastes, Good, & Peebles, 1996; Evans, 2008), especially of human evolution (for example, Nelson, 1986; Sinatra et al., 2003; Poling & Evans, 2004). Evolution ideas are difficult to understand because they often contradict existing alternative ideas (Mayr, 1982; Wolpert, 1994; Evans, 2008). Research suggests that understanding human evolution is a key to evolution education (for example, Blackwell et al., 2003; Besterman & Baggott la Velle, 2007).    This dissertation research investigates how different concept mapping forms embedded in a collaborative technology-enhanced learning environment can support students' integration of evolution ideas using case studies of human evolution. Knowledge Integration (KI) (Linn et al., 2000; Linn et al., 2004) is used as the operational framework to explore concept maps as knowledge integration tools to elicit, add, critically distinguish, group, connect, and sort out alternative evolution ideas. Concept maps are a form of node-link diagram for organizing and representing connections between ideas as a semantic network (Novak & Gowin, 1984). This dissertation research describes the iterative development of a novel biology-specific form of concept map, called Knowledge Integration Map (KIM), which aims to help learners connect ideas across levels (for example, genotype and phenotype levels) towards an integrated understanding of evolution.    Using a design-based research approach (Brown, 1992; Cobb et al., 2003), three iterative studies were implemented in ethically and economically diverse public high schools classrooms using the web-based inquiry science environment (WISE) (Linn et al., 2003; Linn et al., 2004).    Study 1 investigates concept maps as generative assessment tools. Study 1A compares the concept map generation and critique process of biology novices and experts. Findings suggest that concept maps are sensitive to different levels of knowledge integration but require scaffolding and revision. Study 1B investigates the implementation of concept maps as summative assessment tools in a WISE evolution module. Results indicate that concept maps can reveal connections between students' alternative ideas of evolution.    Study 2 introduces KIMs as embedded collaborative learning tools. After generating KIMs, student dyads revise KIMs through two different critique activities (comparison against an expert or peer generated KIM). Findings indicate that different critique activities can promote the use of different criteria for critique. Results suggest that the combination of generating and critiquing KIMs can support integrating evolution ideas but can be time-consuming.    As time in biology classrooms is limited, study 3 distinguishes the learning effects from either generating or critiquing KIMs as more time efficient embedded learning tools. Findings suggest that critiquing KIMs can be more time efficient than generating KIMs. Using KIMs that include common alternative ideas for critique activities can create genuine opportunities for students to critically reflect on new and existing ideas. Critiquing KIMs can encourage knowledge integration by fostering self-monitoring of students' learning progress, identifying knowledge gaps, and distinguishing alternative evolution ideas.    This dissertation research demonstrates that science instruction of complex topics, such as human evolution, can succeed through a combination of scaffolded inquiry activities using dynamic visualizations, explanation activities, and collaborative KIM activities. This research contributes to educational research and practice by describing ways to make KIMs effective and time efficient learning tools for evolution education. Supporting students' building of a more coherent understanding of core ideas of biology can foster their life-long interest and learning of science.

T1  - Toward conceptual development of a theory of clinical instructor identity using the experiences of medical laboratory science practitioners
AN  - 920878922
AB  - This study investigated medical laboratory science clinical instructors' beliefs about teaching and how they viewed themselves as teachers. The first phase of the study included an integrative literature review, which suggests that the development of teacher identity in school-based educators, and to a lesser extent higher education faculty, is dependent on four dimensions: personal factors, training factors, contextual factors, and reflective practice. Using a theory-building research technique, conceptual development of a theory of teacher identity was initiated based on these findings and the proposed theory is depicted in a concept map.     The second phase of this study began qualitative inquiry into the ways that these participants describe their professional identity and talk about their teaching. Interviews were conducted with medical laboratory science clinical instructors in order to gain an understanding of their perceptions of themselves as teachers. The data collected in this study indicate that this group of clinical instructors saw themselves as educators in a variety of ways. They saw themselves as teachers who were responsible for providing students with the technical skills needed to become  competent medical laboratory science practitioners and the theoretical foundation  necessary to pass the national certification exam. The study participants also saw  themselves as mentors who were responsible for passing along professional  knowledge to the next generation of laboratory practitioners.     During data analysis three themes emerged that represent aspects of teacher  identity in clinical instructors (clinical instructor identity): belief in one's teaching  ability (Nature vs. Nurture: We Have the Ability to Teach), desire to expand one's  professional responsibilities ( Professional Identity: Doing Something Extra), and  reflection on one's teaching (Thinking about Teaching Made Me a Better Teacher).  These themes and their supporting elements are generally consistent with the  dimensions of teacher identity identified in the literature review and the seminal  identity theories of Erikson (1956), Marcia (1966), and Gee (2001). The findings  from this study may provide a foundation for future research designed to measure  teacher identity in clinical instructors. Implications for practice are also included.

T1  - Quantitative Comparison of Traditional to Combined Online Instruction for Simple Linear Regression
AN  - 919561709
AB  - Businesses require statistically literate workers. This means people are capable of critical thinking, can analyze real-world data, and possess the ability to communicate their findings. In 2005, the American Statistical Association endorsed the Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) college report (College Report, 2010), outlining ways to improve statistical literacy. The purpose of this exploratory study was to research a possible method of improving statistical literacy under the recommendations of the 2005 GAISE college report by comparing a combined approach of four online instructional methods to traditional methods of lecture and textbook for the topic of simple linear regression. The participants in the study were from MBA cohorts at a private Midwestern university. The research design was a pretest and posttest model with a control group (traditional methods,  N = 11) and quasi-experimental group (combined online methods,  N = 9). Using a Mann-Whitney U test, pretest score differences between groups were not statistically significant (z = -.699,  p = .485), while posttest scores differences between groups were significant (z = -2.265, p = .024). Using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, the control group pretest and posttest difference was not statistically different (z = -.960, p = .337), while the quasi-experimental group difference was statistically significant (z = -2.263, p = .024). This means the two groups started out the same, but ended up with a difference. The Chi-Square analyses for demographic variables showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The results provide evidence that additional research is worth pursuing and that effective and inexpensive online materials are achievable. The online materials are applicable to both corporate and university settings.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping and questioning on students' organization and retention of science knowledge while using interactive informational read-alouds
AN  - 909001832
AB  - According to recent assessment data, there is an urgent need to improve students’ knowledge of science. It has been suggested that the infusion of reading activities including concept mapping, questioning and interactive read-alouds can help students in learning science concepts. Little or no research has combined these methods to examine its effect on learning. The purpose of this study was to examine and compare concept mapping and questioning on students’ organization and retention of science knowledge when used with interactive informational read-alouds of science trade books. This study included 58 third grade students from four homogenous classes who were assigned to either a concept mapping group (experimental group) or a questioning with writing group (comparison group). With the same teacher, the school science specialist, the students completed an eight day unit regarding “soil formation” comprised of read-alouds, discussions and reading comprehension activities. (There were no hands-on, laboratory experiments.) Students were assessed on different types of knowledge.    Data were analyzed using a mixed model ANOVA design to determine both within-factors (repeated measure), to show growth, and between-factors, to determine the difference between the two groups. The concept mapping group (experimental group) performed significantly higher than the questioning with writing group (comparison) on (a) relational vocabulary assessment (measuring relational knowledge); (b) multiple-choice assessment (measuring students’ ability to identify key ideas); and (c) writing assessment (measuring students’ relational thinking, students’ ability to retain and recall key information and students’ ability to use domain knowledge). The concept mapping group maintained these gains in a delayed assessment. The groups did not differ on individual word knowledge as measured by a matching assessment.    Recommendations are provided for teachers and researchers including using concept mapping in teaching science concepts to elementary students in conjunction with science text reading, as well as incorporating technology with computer-generated concept maps using Inspiration software.

T1  - Collective bargaining and faculty unionization: An administrative perspective
AN  - 903801767
AB  - The purpose of this qualitative case study was to gain insight into the perspectives of experienced higher education administrators regarding faculty unionization, the collective bargaining process, and the interpersonal relationships between higher education faculty members and administrators.    The primary method of data collection was semi-structured face to face interviews with nine administrators from two community colleges and two universities in the south Florida area. All of the study participants worked with unionized faculty members and had direct experience participating in bargaining negotiations.    Upon the completion of each interview, the researcher listened to the taped audio recording of the interview several times and then transcribed all of the information from the audiotape into a Word file. Data collection and analysis for each participant were performed concurrently. Using a modified concept mapping approach, the research questions were written on large yellow sticky notes and placed in the middle of a wall in the researcher’s home with nine descriptive categorical themes written on smaller sticky notes placed around the study questions. The highlighted quotes and key phrases were cut from each transcript and placed under each of the descriptive categories. Over the course of a few months repeatedly reviewing the research questions that guided this study, the theory of symbolic interactionism, and relevant literature the categorical descriptive themes were refined and condensed into five descriptive themes.    Study findings indicated that the administrators: (a) must have a clear understanding of what it is that the faculty does to be an effective representative at the bargaining table, (b) experienced role ambiguity and role strain related to a lack of understanding as to their role at the bargaining table and a lack of organizational support, (c) were not offered any type of training in preparation for bargaining, (d) perceived a definite “us versus them” mentality between faculty and administration, and (e) saw faculty collective bargaining at public institutions of higher education in Florida as ineffectual.

T1  - Narcotic analgesic utilization amongst injured workers: using concept mapping to understand current issues from the perspectives of physicians and pharmacists
AN  - 902743180; 22014008
AB  - Abstract              Background: Work-related injuries result in considerable morbidity, as well as social and economic costs. Pain associated with these injuries is a complex, contested topic, and narcotic analgesics (NA) remain important treatment options. Factors contributing to NA utilization patterns are poorly understood. This qualitative study sought to characterize the factors contributing to NA utilization amongst injured workers from the perspectives of physicians and pharmacists.              Methods: The study employed concept mapping methodology, a structured process yielding a conceptual framework of participants' views on a particular topic. A visual display of the ideas/concepts generated is produced. Eligible physicians and pharmacists (n = 22) serving injured workers in the province of Ontario (Canada) were recruited via purposive sampling, and participated in concept mapping activities (consisting of brainstorming, sorting, rating, and map exploration). Participants identified factors influencing NA utilization, and sorted these factors into categories (clusters). Next, they rated the factors on two scales: 'strength of influence on NA over-utilization' and 'amenability to intervention'. During follow-up focus groups, participants refined the maps and discussed the findings and their implications.              Results: 82 factors were sorted into 7 clusters: addiction risks, psychosocial issues, social/work environment factors, systemic-third party factors, pharmacy-related factors, treatment problems , and physician factors . These clusters were grouped into 2 overarching categories/regions on the map: patient-level factors, and healthcare/compensation system-level factors. Participants rated NA over-utilization  as most influenced by patient-level factors, while system-level factors were rated as most amenable to intervention. One system-level cluster was rated highly on both scales (treatment problems  - e.g. poor continuity of care, poor interprofessional communication, lack of education/support for physicians regarding pain management, unavailability of multidisciplinary team-based care, prolonged wait times to see specialists).              Conclusions: Participants depicted factors driving NA utilization among injured workers as complex. Patient-level factors were perceived as most influential on over-utilization, while system-level factors were considered most amenable to intervention. This has implications for intervention design, suggesting that systemic/structural factors should be taken into account in order to address this important health issue.

T1  - EL-Capstone scale development: An emergent literacy concept inventory
AN  - 897139743
AB  - The primary objective of this work was the scale development of a research-based instrument (EL-Capstone) that may be used to measure EL core-knowledge levels of adults working in an environment with expectations of supporting literacy development of young children. Earlier concept inventory, emergent literacy, and test theory literature informed the framework for this assessment instrument.    Designed with three distinct stages, pre-participant, participant, and post-participant, the processes was summarized by six general tasks: (1) define the content, (2) develop and select the instrument items, (3) informal informant sessions, (4) interview sessions with librarians and early literacy practitioners, (5) instrument administration, and (6) evaluation and final refinement. The entire consent-form participant activities centered on developing the items for inclusion in the EL-Capstone inventory.    During the first task, the Developing Early Literacy,  National Early Literacy Panel (NELP) 2008 Report was adopted as "EL-Expert" surrogates to bind the epistemological framework to the NELP authors' theoretical underpinnings of EL concepts. The NELP Report represents an extremely dense synthesis of the EL experimental and quasi-experimental research. By the end of the pre-participant stage concept-mapping activity, ninety-seven potential instrument items had been constructed that fell into three categories, i.e., predictiveness, definitions, and activities. Accompanying the refined sixty-two items presented during the interview sessions (n=10) were 3 ranking questions, i.e., strength of each concept, difficulty level, and perceived importance. The interview results informed instrument item reductions and modifications. Two alternating online versions of EL-Capstone collected data responses for 30 days from anonymous adult volunteers (n=824). An item response theory two-parameter logistic model (2-PL) was applied during the post-participant stage to identify each item's difficulty and discrimination parameters. When fully developed, this research-based scale may be used to measure EL-levels of adults working in an environment with expectations of supporting literacy development of young children. The subsequent collected information may be used to inform early literacy curriculum development and to support program evaluation.

T1  - Using concept mapping as as tool for program theory development
AN  - 889091487
AB  - The purpose of this methodological study is to explore how well a process called concept mapping (Trochim, 1989) can articulate the theory which underlies a social program.  Articulation of a program's theory is a key step in completing a sound theory based evaluation (Weiss, 1997a).  In this study, concept mapping is used to articulate the outcomes domain of a program theory, using Chen's (1990) six domains for program theory as an organizing framework.  A grassroots community organization in Denver, Colorado, provides context for the study.  With reference to Dubin's (1978) distinctions for theoretical units as a guide, the results of concept mapping are analyzed to determine whether they are useful in building a program theory.  Results are also are evaluated to determine whether they present a comprehensive, parsimonious (Whetten, 1989) and valid representation of outcomes from the community organizing intervention.  Methodological and statistical considerations for using concept mapping are mentioned.  The study concludes that concept mapping is a promising tool for theory articulation.  Study limitations and opportunities for future research are also discussed.

T1  - The effects of three concept mapping strategies on seventh-grade students' science achievement at an urban middle school
AN  - 883387101
AB  - There is great concern over students' poor science achievement in the United States. Due to the lack of science achievement, students are not pursing science related careers resulting in an increase in outsourcing to other countries. Learning strategies such as concept mapping may ameliorate this situation by providing students with tools that encourage meaningful learning. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to measure the effects of three concept mapping learning strategies (concept identifying, proposition identifying, student generated) on urban middle school students' understanding of the circulatory system. Three intact classes of seventh-grade students were assigned to one of the three concept mapping strategies. The students were given a pretest on the circulatory system then learned and used their respective concept mapping strategies while learning about the circulatory system. At the conclusion of the study, students' science achievement was measured by performance on an achievement test and rubric scores of their respective concept identifying, proposition identifying, and student generated concept maps. The results of the study suggest that all three of the concept mapping strategies are effective in increasing students' science achievement. Additionally, the moderate significant correlations between the posttest and concept map scores of the current study established that concept maps are a useful measure of student knowledge. Lastly, the results of the current study also suggest that the concept identifying mapping strategy may be a useful scaffold in instructing students how to develop student generated concept maps.

T1  - Stories and cultural humility: Exploring power and privilege through physical therapist life histories
AN  - 873443800
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how life experiences, set within their social, cultural, and historical contexts, shape the development of cultural humility in physical therapists (PTs). Cultural humility involves health professionals being actively engaged in an ongoing process with patients, colleagues, communities, and themselves to make sense of the complexities of social and culture differences within relationships in practice. Given demographic trends and health care disparities, it has become critically important to better understand the dynamics of developing trusting relationships to provide quality care.    This study was influenced by relationship-centered care, sociocultural, and insurgent multiculturalism theories. A qualitative, life history study was designed to answer four major research questions: (1) What types of life experiences do PTs perceive frame the way they address cultural differences and build relationships? (2) What contextual influences do PTs perceive have facilitated or constrained their development of cultural humility? (3) How do PTs’ life histories elucidate how they attend to or resist facing issues of privilege and power in relationships? (4) What are the implications that attention to one’s own culture, privileges, and biases from a life history perspective hold for health professional curricular and pedagogical choices? Eight PTs participated in this study. The primary research method used was one-onone semi-structured interviews. Data were coded and analyzed for themes through constant comparison and constructing concept maps.    Five major themes centered on the development of cultural humility and building trusting relationships could be traced through the life histories: (1) being open-minded and listening attentively as patients tell their stories; (2) responding to a person’s emotions matters; (3) focusing care around a patient’s goals and needs; (4) teaching to engage and empower; and (5) evolving awareness of community needs and assets. Taking into account how participants used their life stories to make experiences and contextual influences meaningful, this study offers a framework for educators who are interested in using narratives to foster professional development. By virtue of ongoing reflection on practice and ones biography, including ones privilege, health professionals can be habitually engaged to action to build trusting relationships across difference.

T1  - Black Students and Mathematics Achievement: A Mixed-Method Analysis of In-School and Out-of-School Factors Shaping Student Success
AN  - 865880034
AB  - Achievement gap language has become associated with the observed disparities on a number of educational measures between the academic performances of Black and White students. This theoretical lens is problematic because it sends an unintended message that Black students are not worthy of study in their own right. Using a mixed-methodological approach, this study aimed to respond to the call of math educator Gutierrez (2008) who urges education researchers to "move away from gap gazing and toward more contextualized and intervention studies" (p. 362). Chapter 2 offers a socio-historical perspective to illuminate the evidence of Blacks' limited access both to mathematics as a discipline of study and a career path. A gap in the literature on the history of math education of Blacks exists, thus Tolley's (2003) seminal study on the factors that influenced the study of math and science for European girls (1840s to 1950s) is used to generate hypotheses about what factors might contribute or inhibit math participation and achievement of Blacks. Chapter 3 identifies four contemporary factors and closes with a concept map combining all eight factors. Along with the historical analysis, 69 student surveys and 12 in-depth interviews provided robust data that revealed an additional four factors—personality style, teacher- student relationships, motivation, and human agency. This study defined success broadly to include not only test scores, but persistence, course-taking patterns, fulfilling college admission requirements, and positive math identities. A mathematical model is put forth as a different way to think about math achievement for Black students schooled in the U.S. The model helps us to understand that Black students' math achievement can be viewed as a summation of a group of factors that are a part of what I call a micro and macro socio- historical background.

T1  - Concept Mapping and the Science Achievement of Third Grade Students
AN  - 864830890
AB  - Instructional strategies in science that fail to identify students’ initial understanding of scientific concepts may leave students’ flawed ideas unchanged, thus affecting their ability to synthesize, differentiate, and connect to new information in science. The purpose of this quantitative study was to examine the relationship between concept mapping and science achievement. Cognitive learning theories formed the theoretical framework for the study. The research questions addressed in this study examined whether a significant difference exists between the concept mapping (treatment) and the traditional (control) groups on posttest scores and on test scores across time and group. A one way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was used to determine if there was a significant difference on posttest scores from 70 third grade students after controlling for pretest scores. Results of the ANCOVA analysis revealed the homogeneity of regression slopes assumption was not met. A two way repeated measures mixed factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine if there were differences on participants’ test scores by time and group. A statistically significant effect was found within subjects’ main effect across time and between subjects main effect by group. These findings provide a direction for facilitating social change by recognizing conceptual structures that enable students to distinguish the interrelatedness between new and existing knowledge for learning, suggesting implications for effecting achievement in school and in the workplace. This research is significant to educators, administrators, and parents in providing an understanding of concept mapping and the effect on cognitive learning.

T1  - Librarians' Leadership for Lifelong Learning
AN  - 848952738
AB  - In the context of a quality initiative to improve organizational performance, action research was conducted through a library program called Delaware Library Learning Journeys held in libraries and other venues throughout the state of Delaware from 2007 to 2010.  A total of 685 voluntary, self-selected participants in 48 Learning Journeys sessions provided evidence of the phenomenon of self-directed lifelong learning through surveys and discussions of individual interests and personal methods for tracking reading and learning.  Lifelong learning organizers were developed and tested.  The resulting Executive Position Paper includes a lifewide learning concept map from the review of the literature; the Delaware Library Quality Cycle integrates the four learning realms; and recommendations provide guidance for library leaders in developing policies and systematic proactive approaches to services for lifelong learners.

T1  - Concept Mapping: Implementation in an EFL Classroom
AN  - 2269348956
AB  - This study looks at the impact of student-generated concept mapping on the performance of 12th grade EFL students in the reading comprehension of texts. In doing so, 14 grade 12 EFL students were selected from a high school in Israel. These students were tested on three separate occasions. First, the students were given a tutorial on how to create a visual aid during the reading, more specifically, concept maps. Then the students partook in three lessons; whereby, they employed concept mapping strategies. After each lesson, the students completed reading comprehension tests based on the text that they had read. In addition, following each test, the students were interviewed in order to assess their disposition towards self-generated concept mapping. Results indicate that self-generated concept mapping by low-knowledge students had a significantly greater influence on the students' text comprehension than did the self-generated concept mapping by high-knowledge students in both control groups. In addition, the students' disposition toward self-generated concept mapping had a progressive positive change, regardless of the students' level.

T1  - A Concept Mapping Needs Assessment of Young Families with Parental Cancer
AN  - 2027412266
AB  - The purpose of this research is to investigate the support needs of young families living with and beyond a parental diagnosis of cancer. The sample includes 56 participants comprised of 31 professional stakeholders and 25 patient stakeholders affiliated with the Charles R. Wood Cancer Center. It was hypothesized there would be differences in how the groups of stakeholders rated needs in terms of importance, satisfaction, and utilization. Differences in ratings are thought to be barriers to effective program development. While not a formal research hypothesis, it was anticipated other program development barriers germane to naturalistic clinical settings would emerge from the organizational, community, practitioner, and researcher domains. By utilizing an internet-based method of needs assessment known as Concept Mapping, the researcher facilitated discovering 125 emergent patient and family needs. An eight-cluster model of identified issues and needs was constructed. The cluster names assigned include Emotional Impact on Parents, Parents' Worries About Children, Family Adaptation to Illness, Navigation, Case Management, Emotional Impact on Children, Kids' Support Needs, and Families' Support Needs. Results indicate differences in how the patient and professional stakeholders rate the statements on all levels, indicating potential barriers to effective program development. The cluster rated lowest on satisfaction and highest on level of importance and utilization is Case Management, indicating a need for initial and on-going psychosocial needs assessment throughout the experience of a parental diagnosis of cancer. Limitations for this study are discussed in addition to recommendations for oncology support program development at the Charles R. Wood Cancer Center.

T1  - The effects of using problem-based learning in science and technology teaching upon students' academic achievement and levels of structuring concepts
AN  - 1955058854
AB  - The present study aimed to investigate the impact of the problem-based learning method used in science and technology teaching upon elementary school students' construction levels for the concepts concerning the "Systems in Our Body" unit in the science and technology course and their academic achievement. To this end, during the four-week experimental application process, the course was taught using the problem-based learning method in the experimental group and the control group curriculum was only based on the science and technology textbook. The study used two groups including the experimental (n=20) and control (n=21) groups, and the study used the pretest posttest control group semi-experimental design. The analysis of the obtained data revealed a significant difference in favor of the experimental group on students' scores on the academic achievement test and the open-ended questions that identified their construction levels for the concepts. This study should guide further studies and to help determine the effectiveness of the method in question on elementary school students.

T1  - Teaching floating and sinking concepts with different methods and techniques based on the 5E instructional model
AN  - 1955058678
AB  - The purpose of this study was to test the influences of prepared instructional material based on the 5E instructional model combined with CCT, CC, animations, worksheets and POE on conceptual changes about floating and sinking concepts. The experimental group was taught with teaching material based on the 5E instructional model enriched with different teaching methods and techniques including: POE, worksheets, conceptual change text, concept cartoons and animation activities. And the control group was taught with teaching materials based on the 5E instructional model conducted by the Ministry of Education. The pretest, posttest and delayed posttest were applied to the experimental and control groups. Obtained data was analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. It was seen that students in the experimental group provided more correct reasoning than did the control group in posttest and delayed posttest. Most of the students in the control group have not changed their alternative concepts in the posttest, although the experimental group students moved their alternative concepts in the posttest.

T1  - Making Chemistry Relevant to the Engineering Major
AN  - 762226535
AB  - As part of a campus-wide, externally funded project to increase performance in, enthusiasm for, and retention within STEM disciplines, we developed an interdisciplinary, team-taught first-year seminar course. The construction and delivery of this course was designed to show the relevance of selected general chemistry topics such as matter and energy to students in STEM disciplines outside of chemistry, particularly to pre-engineering students. Centered on a "science in space" theme, students in the course participated in a series of hands-on, open-ended activities adapted from the chemical education literature. Concept maps were used as assessment tools to measure improvement of cognition, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills. These instruments were also useful in evaluating the students' grasp of relevance regarding general chemistry topics. At the end of the course, participating students have shown improvement in all targeted skill areas and articulate the relevance of chemistry to engineering, physics, and other STEM disciplines. Additionally, students participating in this program have increased academic success during their first year and beyond, as measured by retention, test performance, GPA, and progression metrics.

T1  - Building a framework for a geriatric acute care model
AN  - 761424668
AB  - Purpose - The purpose of this mixed methods study is to define the core components of a system-wide, acute care program designed to meet the needs of older adults. Design/methodology/approach - Concept mapping methodology (multidimensional scaling and cluster analysis) was used to obtain data describing the core components of a geriatric acute care model. The input of 306 "stakeholders" (clinicians, administrators, consumers, educators, and researchers) was obtained through a world wide web interface, supplemented with consumer interviews. Findings - The findings yielded eight clusters describing components of a geriatric acute care program: guiding principles, leadership, organizational structures, physical environment, patient- and family-centered approaches, aging-sensitive practices, geriatric staff competence, and interdisciplinary resources and processes. A total of 113 items that describe dimensions of quality were identified with these clusters. Practical implications - The clusters and dimensions provide a framework for a hospital to use to plan, implement, and evaluate an acute care model for older adults. Originality/value - There is not a common understanding of what constitutes a comprehensive set of resources, programs, and activities to address the needs of hospitalized older adults and their families and the staff who serve them. Concept mapping was an effective method of engaging the perspectives of various stakeholders in creating a framework to address these needs, as well as useful in illuminating areas for future research.

T1  - The Effect of Teacher Generated Concept Maps on the Learning of Linear Motion Concepts in Elementary Physics
AN  - 1659735390
AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of using teacher generated concept maps on the learning of linear motion concepts in physics. The study used a pre and post-test quasi-experimental design method with a control group. The experimental group (n= 28) was taught physics with the aids of concept maps that were generated by the teacher while the control group (n= 29) was taught using the conventional method without concept maps. The results show that students using concept maps are more active in class and obtain a statistically significantly higher gain scores on the physics test ( =17.3) compared to the non-concept mapping group ( =12.9) with p < 0.05. It is concluded that teacher generated concept maps is an effective teaching and learning tool for promoting concept learning of linear motion in physics.

T1  - Comparison of the Structural, Relational and Proposition Accuracy Scoring Results of Concept Maps about Atom
AN  - 1659734770
AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of the relationships among concepts. It includes concepts, linking lines and phrases which describe the relationship between concepts. It is used in science education for several purposes. One of them is the use of concept mapping as an assessment tool. The current study reports the results of a research that has been compared three concept mapping scoring methods: structural method, relational method and proposition accuracy method. Subjects of this study were 10 prospective chemistry teachers (5 females and 4 males) who had taken the Special Instruction Methods Course in Chemistry at Education Faculty of Balýkesir University during 2005-2006 academic year. The ANOVA statistical test for the comparison of the three means gave an F value equal to 36.139, with p <0.05, so there is statistically significant difference among the three scoring method's means.

T1  - Making Learning Visible: Using E-maps to Enhance Critical Reading Skills
AN  - 1497198583
AB  - Research suggests that the use of concept maps enhances learning transfer and retention. This paper presents a case study on the use of a hybrid concept/mind mapping online strategy (E-mapping) to develop critical reading skills in first year Egyptian students enrolled at the American University in Cairo. Seventy students participated in the study and data were collected over two semesters. E-maps and assignment-specific rubrics were used to assess learning. Student feedback was collected via early and late semester surveys and a mid-semester assessment. Results show that E-mapping is a potentially powerful active learning tool which goes beyond developing strong reading skills and enhancing class participation. It enhances critical thinking and helps students acquire visualization skills by which they can communicate ideas using imagery. It is also an assessment tool that permits instructors to gain insight into their students' analytical and synthetic skills. Although the majority of students in this study recognized the benefits of E-mapping, many of them found it a time consuming approach and believed it represented too much work.

Resumen

              
La investigación sugiere que el uso de mapas de concepto incrementa la transferencia y retención del aprendizaje Este documento presenta el estudio de un caso sobre el uso de una estrategia del concepto híbrido/planimetría intelectual online (planificación de programas E) para desarrollar habilidades de lectura durante el primer año de estudiantes Egipcios que se matricularon en la American University en Cairo. Setenta estudiantes participaron en el estudio y se recolectaron datos durante dos semestres. Se utilizaron mapas - e y rúbricas de tareas-específicas para evaluar el aprendizaje. La retroalimentación estudiantil fue recopilada a través de exámenes al inicio y al término del semestre y una evaluación a mediados del semestre. Los resultados indican que la planimetría-E es una herramienta potencialmente poderosa y activa en el aprendizaje que va más allá de desarrollar potentes habilidades de lectura y acrecentar la participación en clases. Ésta incrementa el pensamiento crítico y ayuda a los estudiantes a adquirir habilidades visuales mediante las cuales se pueden comunicar utilizando imágenes. A la vez es una herramienta de evaluación que permite a los instructores obtener claridad sobre las habilidades sintéticas y analíticas de sus estudiantes. A pesar de que la mayoría de los estudiantes en este estudio reconocieron los beneficios de la planimetría-E, muchos de ellos encontraron que demandaba mucho tiempo y consideraban que representaba demasiado trabajo.

Introduction

              
One of the most common complaints of professors teaching freshmen is that students rarely read the assigned texts, and when they do, they often do not understand the reading on their own and expect instructors to analyze it for them (Brent and Felder, 1996) for a deeper more critical understanding of the topics discussed. Other studies suggest that critical reading skills are often weak at the undergraduate level and requires the implementation of specific techniques to develop ( Chamberlain & Burrough, 1985). The literature is replete with strategies that have been proposed to address this problem: some instructors require students to write summaries or questions about the reading (Hendersen & Rosenthal, 2006), others use graphing techniques for reading and learning enhancement (Chmielewski & Dansereau, 1998), while still others (Marcell, 2008) use online quizzes to test the assigned reading material.

              
At the American University in Cairo (AUC), where the authors teach, the freshmen students are no exception to this occurrence. In addition, because they are predominantly Egyptians, the majority speak English as a second language and many of them may be minimally proficient at reading and writing scientific texts.

              
The context for this case-study on the implementation of E-mapping as a critical reading strategy is Scientific Thinking, a core curriculum course required for all students at the AUC, which is an institution that provides an education strongly grounded in the traditional liberal arts and sciences. Scientific Thinking aims to develop a broad understanding of the scientific method, and one of the objectives of the course is to cultivate the habits of mind characteristic of a scientific approach to the world. The importance of the use of observable empirical data through experimentation and observation as well as the value of various forms of evidence, are highlighted. E-maps would be useful in helping students identify relevant information within assigned texts.

              
The course is structured around a series of general lectures provided to all students in an auditorium by AUC faculty and visiting lecturers. Small class sessions follow including discussions and activities aimed at reinforcing the themes covered during the lecture. Students are assigned a number of selected texts for each topic to which they have online access through WebCT (currently Blackboard), the course management system. Students are instructed to come to class prepared for discussions or for class activities based on the assigned texts. Many students come to class unprepared to actively discuss assigned texts and unable to contribute in class activities.

              
Faced with this problem, the authors of this paper tried various techniques in the past including Eric Mazur's reading quiz strategy (1997) which consisted of giving a 3-5 minute reading quiz at the start of each class to encourage pre-class reading and to check if students had a basic understanding of the material.

              
Although the students were more prepared, the result of this approach did not reflect the level of critical reading expected of freshmen. Students were unable to identify the main ideas within the text, analyze or critique an argument. They were also unable to recognize purpose or bias within the text.

              
This paper investigates the use of the hybrid concept/mind mapping online technique to enhance text comprehension and to develop critical reading, as well as increase class participation in the Scientific Thinking course. The aim was to explore the potential of such a technique for enhancing the quality and quantity of interaction with text and among students and instructors. The research was completed in Spring 2008.

              
Background and Method

              
Of the several reading strategies that are successful, graphic strategies provide readers with visual approaches to reading that are different from traditional, linear text presentation (Chang et al, 2002). The authors decided to try concept mapping and mind mapping as the graphical strategy that would help enhance text comprehension and lead to more meaningful information retention.

              
Concept maps were first introduced by Novak and his colleagues at Cornell in the 1960s as a means to visually represent relationships among concepts. Concept maps consist of terms, concepts or nodes of information usually embedded in boxes connected by directional links between the nodes with arrows and/or linking phrases (Figure 1.)

              
Mind mapping, on the other hand, introduced in the 1960s by Buzan, is a graphical technique of taking notes or representing thoughts or ideas in a visual manner. While concept maps may have many ideas, mind maps are structured around one central concept, word or idea, with branches and sub-branches of related ideas. Both mapping techniques highlight links among concepts, and mind maps are usually highly visual including pictures and colors as well as other visual prompts (see Figure 2, Figure 3). Both methods are based on an adaptation of constructivism, an epistemology which regards learning as a unique sense-making and knowledge construction activity that happens as the result of the person's interaction with the world around him/her, in terms of texts, objects, and people. This focus on the uniqueness of knowledge construction acknowledges the influence of learners' individual characteristics, prior knowledge, needs, and goals in that construction, and the importance of providing individuals with scaffolds that help them bridge the 'zone of proximal development' (Duffy, 2002) .

In studies involving different disciplines and age groups, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge transfer and retention (Nesbit & Adesope, 2006), ( Romance & Vitale, 1999). It was decided to introduce these tools to encourage in-depth, pre-class reading as preparation for in-class discussion. The authors used a hybrid approach to mapping to integrate the powerful visual cues of mind mapping into concept maps. Visual cues included icons indicating positive or negative value and icons reflecting various degrees of importance such as a "thumbs-up" sign. For the purpose of this paper, the technique will be referred to as "E-mapping" (Ruffini, 2008). E-mapping was incorporated into the syllabus of three Scientific Thinking sections over two semesters, with the goal of developing critical reading and better class participation in face-to-face class discussions. Since concept maps had also been successfully used as assessment tools (Walker & King, 2003, Stoddart et al, 2000), another goal was to identify how students think and how they organize their ideas. This latter information can guide instructors in identifying and correcting students' misconceptions and help to resolve the conflict between their prior knowledge, personal theories and new information found in the reading texts.

              
The E-mapping technique was gradually introduced as most students had not used it before. The authors anticipated that some students would experience difficulty translating linear text into nonlinear graphic representation as this was a different approach for them. At first, a short in-class reading was given to them and they were asked to practice the technique/strategy by sketching a concept map by hand. They were then asked, as a class, to brainstorm and work out a map on the board.

              
After an initial pen and pencil introduction, all students were introduced to the free online "Mindomo" software. This is a versatile web-based mind mapping tool that runs in a Web browser, with the maps being stored on Mindomo server. No complex software need be installed or maintained; only a Web browser with a Flash player is needed. Everything a user needs from basic desktop software is available: rich formatting, curved lines, images and symbols, relationships, notes fields, task data, drag and drop editing, and Web hyperlinks. Computer generated maps offer many advantages over paper and pencil including the option of altering maps easily, inserting images and hyperlinks, saving the map as an image or PDF file, and a wide variety of other options. Students can create group accounts allowing online collaboration where they can work on more complex tasks requiring group work. By making their maps public, the work can be viewed by classmates and discussed in class.

              
Assignments

              
In this study, the students were given three types of assignments of increasing difficulty:

              
*

              
Design an E-map for some of the assigned weekly readings.

              
*

              
Create an E-map as a summary to the weekly "general" lectures .This was a more demanding exercise. They had to revise notes and listen to recorded audio files of the lecture as well as collaborate with peers to produce a group map.

              
* Create an E-map for a broad topic such as the following example:

              
Step-by-step PowerPoint presentations were used in class to show students how to create, save, export and print their maps. These presentations were made available online for review. An additional workshop was arranged for students having difficulty with the concepts introduced in class.

              
Assessment

              
Students were assessed using a rubric that the authors developed based on preliminary analysis of early maps. Students were given the rubric which spelled out for them how the quality of their analysis and interpretation would be translated to a grade. The rubric is shown in Table 1.

              
Table 1. E-map Grading Rubric.

              
Participants and Data Collection

              
The participants consisted of 70 students enrolled in three sections of the 100-level Scientific Thinking course. The authors were the instructors and data were collected over two semesters. The data collected consisted of student E-maps, early and late semester anonymous surveys, and a mid-semester small group instructional diagnosis (SGID) (White, 2008).

              
Surveys

              
*

              
An early semester survey was conducted four weeks into the semester after students had submitted a simple hand-drawn concept map based on a 500 word newspaper article followed by a computer generated E-map of a reading. By then, students had attended two classes introducing E-mapping and Mindomo software The following five statements were included in the survey:

              
*

              
I now understand the basic principles of concept mapping

              
*

              
I was able to use Mindomo software easily

              
*

              
On average I spent...less than 30 minutes, 30-60 minutes, more than 60 minutes. on the assigned concept map

              
*

              
Concept mapping helped me identify the main ideas in the reading

              
*

              
Concept mapping required me to look at the reading in more depth

              
The same survey was administered at the end of the semester to see if there were any differences in students' perceptions regarding the use of E-mapping.

              
b) Small Group Instructional Diagnosis (SGID)

              
Students also participated in a mid-semester SGID session conducted in the absence of the instructor by trained facilitators from the Center for Learning and Teaching (CLT) at the American University in Cairo. The facilitators informed the students that the SGID is a method for collecting feedback for purposes of improving their learning experience during the course and not an evaluation of the teacher, thus encouraging a candid and safe discussion. This SGID allowed the instructor to use student feedback to adapt the course later during the semester and in subsequent semesters. For the SGID, participants were divided into groups of three to four students and were asked the following two questions:

              
*

              
What helps you learn in this course?

              
*

              
What improvements would you like and how would you suggest they be made?

              
Each group was to reach a consensus for the questions asked and to record and submit their answers during the SGID. After sharing the answers, the CLT facilitators conducted a short discussion to ensure clarification and consensus. In this particular case, an emphasis was placed on the E-mapping activity.

              
c) Student E-maps Maps were graded and detailed feedback was given to students based on the rubric provided. Students were expected to use the rubric to construct E-maps that outlined the main themes in the reading as well as learn to separate ideas under the main themes. They were also expected to identify purpose as well as bias, and to use appropriate visual icons.

              
Results and Discussion

              
Strengths of E-mapping

              
The authors' original goal was to ensure that pre-class reading was done in-depth and that active class participation in the discussion followed. Students responded favorably to simple mapping tasks and a detailed rubric was designed (see Table 1) which guided them through a more rigorous critical reading approach requiring students to identify the main ideas in the text, to identify purpose and to analyze an argument. A summary of the benefits of the method follows.

              
Students actually read the text and the in-class discussions were much more meaningful with more students participating.

              
Students were forced to read the text critically . Figure 3 is an example of an E-map that students had to draw for an assigned reading entitled Scientific Thinking and the Scientific Method ( Schafersman, 1997). The basic mapping strategy was to have students convert linear text into a non-linear graphic representation. This exercise was especially useful for our freshmen students who are used to thinking and studying in a linear manner. This is often considered a by-product of local curricula and traditional teaching methods, of assessment techniques that deemphasize high-order thinking skills such as synthesis and evaluation, and of limited English reading ability for many Egyptian speakers of English as a second language. The method required them to represent the article as a whole and to visually demonstrate relationships between concepts or ideas.

              
Figure 3. Example of an early E-map of a reading assignment with a section magnified.

              
In the example of Figure 3, the student was able to highlight the four main ideas of the article, to demonstrate the relative importance of the major concepts and to use the visual cues of thu mbs up or down to interpret meaning. Simple relationships were also effectively mapped through connecting arrows from an assigned reading that was to be discussed later in class. This basic map was considered a good starting point. An average freshman student would be expected to achieve this level of proficiency/understanding.

              
Figures 4A and 4B are two examples of E-maps of a General Lecture presentation by an invited speaker. The topic was "Who are the greatest scientists of all time?" Although both are well organized, the differences in detail, organization and structure are very apparent. In Figure 4A, the relative importance of ideas is indicated but is not very distinctive, and relationships are not mapped. In Figure 4B, simple and complex relationships are very effectively mapped and the non-linear structure provides a very complete picture of the lecture content. In addition, the student who mapped Figure 4B made very effective use of the visual elements of the mind mapping software (different ideas were grouped according to different colors and shape). Visual symbols added interpretive meaning (see Figure 5B) where icons indicating positive or negative significance could be included. This added another level to the map requiring students to interpret the concepts within the text one step further within the space constraints required to construct E-maps.

E-maps provide insights into learners' unique knowledge construction, and no two maps are ever the same . This is where the strength of E-mapping lies:

              
a) No two maps can ever be the same. This aligns well with constructivist theory - learning is a unique construction and scaffolding is needed within the individual learner's zone of proximal development. The value of these maps is in the insight they provide on an individual's learning process.

              
b) They provide immediate visual data on a student's perceptions or misperceptions, providing prompt feedback on his/her understanding.

              
E-maps are a window into students "thinking" providing a catalyst.

              
Figures 5A and 5B are E-maps of Karl Popper's article Heroic Science (Popper, 1974). Most students complained that the article was difficult. Yet, for most of them, the E-maps revealed that they had understood it, and the in-class discussion was productive. Had they simply been assigned to read it, they would have abandoned it and come unprepared to class relying on the professor's explanation.

              
Examining those two E-maps shows how an instructor can perceive the different analytical skills of students, and how one can "read" their interpretation (or misinterpretation) of the article. By noting how students map out key concepts and whether they include descriptive icons or arrows to link concepts, an initial appraisal of the student's grasp of the material can be made. Students who fail to see the connection between concepts or fail to include a piece of relevant information are usually misinterpreting the reading material or failing to grasp the key concepts.

              
Figure 5A is the E-map of a student with poor analytical skills who used the non-linear structure of the map to weave in a narrative. In that case, linear thinking is forced in the non-linear packaging of an E-map. The ability to distinguish the relative importance of ideas/concepts seems to be lacking and so is the ability to find correct relationships among the various ideas in the text. (Note that there are 32 primary branches and very few secondary branches reflecting an inability to identify the main themes of the text) On the other hand, Figure 5B (an E-map of the same article) shows that the student can distinguish very clearly the significant and relevant ideas and has used visual cues effectively to reinforce a correct interpretation of the article.

              
Figure 5A. A student's E-map revealing poor analytical skills.

              
Figure 5B. Another's student's E-map of the same article.

              
E-maps develop students' synthesis skills taking knowledge construction to a different level.

              
The next two E-maps (Figures 6 and 7) illustrate a different type of assignment and/or exam question (on an exam they used pencil and paper). In this approach, students did not have the scaffolding afforded by a specific article or lecture. They were asked to draw an E-map of a broad open-ended topic which they had discussed in class. Their sources were lectures, articles and websites. This approach called upon their synthesis skills and challenged them to present a coherent overall picture of the topic at hand.

Figure 7. Computerized rendition of a student's pencil and paper concept map

Figure 7 is a computerized rendition of a student's pencil and paper concept map in an in-class exam question. They were asked what they knew about the DNA molecule and its connection to broader topics. This type of E-map is the more traditional way of using maps to assess knowledge, where students filled in the answers in spaces provided, versus the more complex task of constructing an E-map on their own based on assigned text.

              
Students' Reaction to E-mapping

              
Survey results

              
Figures 8-13 compare the cumulative results of two surveys, discussed in the methods section, given to the three sections over two semesters. The first one was an early semester survey (ESS) and the other was a late semester survey (LSS). From Figures 8 and 9, one can conclude that a majority of students find the Mindomo software easy to use and that they understand the basic principles of concept mapping. At the end of the semester more students strongly agreed to these two statements than at the beginning (49.0% vs. 34.7% and 46.7% vs. 28.3% respectively). Also, on the whole they were spending more time on E-maps at the end of the term than at the beginning (Figure 10), mostly because the assignments were more open-ended integrative projects requiring more research and time.

Figure 9. Student response to survey question #2.

              
Figure 10. Student response to survey question #3.

              
In addition, a majority of students agreed or strongly agreed that the E-mapping exercise helped them identify the main ideas in the reading (Figure 11), and at the end of the semester the percentage increased from 59.7% to 66.3%. However the percentage of those who disagreed went up from 5.3 to 10.7%. This may be explained by a number of students who were initially neutral and who then shifted to either agreeing or disagreeing.

              
Figure 11. Student response to survey question #4 .

              
In answer to the last question (Figure 12), although a majority of students still strongly agreed/agreed (73.7% and 71.3%) that concept mapping required more in-depth reading, those who disagreed went up from 4.3 to 9% and 4% strongly disagreed. This may also be explained in the same manner with neutral students changing their opinion as the course progressed.

              
Figure 12. Student response to survey question # 5.

              
Feedback from SGID

              
It should be remembered that the SGID is administered mid-semester and is meant for formative assessment purposes only. Therefore, it is not expected to mirror the results of the early and late semester surveys.

              
When asked what helped them learn in the course, students' responses varied in the three classes surveyed. Regarding E-maps, four out of the six groups surveyed in one class claimed that "E-maps helped them understand the readings better," "were useful for complex articles" and "helps me to understand the whole passage as I will have to highlight the main points."

              
In the same class three out of the six groups said that they had "too many concept maps" or "too many concept maps for a 100 level course." Individual feedback during free discussion revealed some resistance to the extra time and effort required to create an E-map for readings, especially when they compared their workload with the other 16-20 other sections of the course. In another class surveyed, three out of six groups claimed that they "liked concept maps but thought they were too much work" and two groups reported that they thought the software was not "user friendly." This might have been the reason for the decreased satisfaction by the end of the semester. Two groups also reported that concept maps "helped them learn." However further studies are needed to verify and explore students' concerns about concept maps.

              
On the whole, the SGID results showed that students seemed to recognize the benefit of the E-maps but strongly reacted to the workload in general. It is worth noting that in response to this feedback, the number of E-maps was reduced. Weekly individual E-mapping assignments were replaced by E-maps incorporated into take-home portions of exams. E-maps requiring additional effort and synthesis skills were given as mini-projects toward final exams.

              
Conclusions

              
From this case study, we concluded that E-mapping is a potentially powerful learning tool. When coupled with an accompanying rubric, students learn to distinguish between important and less important information, learn to search for connections among what they read, what they know, and identify the different concepts of the course.

              
Furthermore, when they use the E-mapping technique to represent open-ended topics, students' synthesis and analytical skills are enhanced. In particular, E-mapping assignments give them the chance to express themselves individually and in groups. For many of them, this was an opportunity to be visually creative given that computer generated maps allow the insertion of images, symbols, notes and hyperlinks.

              
E-mapping also proved to be a powerful assessment tool. It allowed instructors to glimpse into their students' thinking processes and to gain insight into their students' analytical and synthesis skills. It provided immediate visual data on the quality of a students' interpretation of text.

              
Although the majority of students agreed that E-mapping "required them to look at the reading in more depth" and helped them identify the main ideas, many of them found E-mapping a time consuming approach to reading and represented too much work.

              
E-mapping is by no means a unique way of testing or evaluating content or critical thinking, but it is a powerful active learning strategy. In addition, it allows students to acquire good visualization skills by which they can communicate ideas using imagery, a recognized important 21 st century skill.

T1  - Non-traditional learners in higher education: comparison of a traditional MCQ examination with concept mapping to assess learning in a dental radiological science course
AN  - 749718057
AB  - The aim of this study is to argue for alternative assessment methods (i.e. concept map) considering the changes in demography in higher education. In the case of school of dentistry, for example, there is an urgent call for a catalyst for new assessment methods in dental education in view of the drive to comprehensively assess professional competence to cater to the current work requirement; this quantitative study compared two different approaches to assessment following a first-year undergraduate course for dental and hygiene and therapy students. The assessment methods compared were multiple-choice questions and concept mapping. The data suggest that concept mapping can be appropriate for non-traditional students (i.e. adult learners), particularly those who already have professional experience in related practice. This is because concept mapping allows learners to locate their new knowledge in a broader social and experiential frame. The implications are discussed. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Measuring students' information skills through concept mapping
AN  - 745409651
AB  - This paper seeks to develop a methodology that will discover, specify and measure students' abilities and skills in creating concept maps. Because competencies are the key factor in higher education, the paper analyzes the role of concept maps as a tool to diagnose and improve information analysis, synthesis, organization and representation skills and competencies. We propose a methodology that enables these skills to be evaluated by observing, analyzing and measuring the stages involved in creating a concept map: identification of the main and secondary subjects; subject codification by concepts; grading of concepts; and representation of the concepts and their relationships with labels. A case study using action research methodology tests its usefulness on a group of university students of library and information science. The method proposed provides information on the strengths and weaknesses of the students' skills, thus enabling their training to be improved by means of specific actions. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Trends of Science Education Research: An Automatic Content Analysis
AN  - 2259454376
AB  - This study used scientometric methods to conduct an automatic content analysis on the development trends of science education research from the published articles in the four journals of International Journal of Science Education, Journal of Research in Science Teaching, Research in Science Education, andScience Education from 1990 to 2007. The multi-stage clustering technique was employed to investigate with what topics, to what development trends, and from whose contribution that the journal publications constructed as a science education research field. This study found that the research topic of Conceptual Change & Concept Mapping was the most studied topic, although the number of publications has slightly declined in the 2000’s. The studies in the themes of Professional Development, Nature of Science and Socio-Scientific Issues, and Conceptual Chang and Analogy were found to be gaining attention over the years. This study also found that, embedded in the most cited references, the supporting disciplines and theories of science education research are constructivist learning, cognitive psychology, pedagogy, and philosophy of science.

T1  - Beyond the ba: managing enabling contexts in knowledge organizations
AN  - 612873534
AB  - Looking at the practical experience of organizations pursuing knowledge management, it is found that their efforts are primarily focused on creating the conditions and the context that will enable knowledge creation. This need for developing enabling conditions and contexts was identified more than a decade ago when Nonaka and associates introduced the concept of ba. This paper aims to map the development of the concept of ba in a number of disciplines in order to understand its theoretical evolution and practical application. A comprehensive search and evaluation of the literature resulted in a database of 135 papers, four dissertations and four books. Using content analysis, citation analysis, and concept mapping, four categories of research findings are identified that in turn suggest four groups of conditions for enabling knowledge creation. The paper discusses each of these conditions (the social/behavioral, cognitive/epistemic, information systems/management, and strategy/structural), and introduces a framework that relates these conditions to the type of knowledge process and the level of interaction that characterize a knowledge management activity in the organization. It is concluded that managing knowledge in organizations is fundamentally about creating an environment in the organization that is conducive to and encourages knowledge creation, sharing and use. Organizations interested in pursuing knowledge management and innovation may wish to be guided by the enabling conditions presented here that have been discovered over ten years of research. These conditions and the frameworks of which they are part can help managers to analyze, discuss, and introduce specific combinations of enabling factors that are tailored according to the type of knowledge process and level of interaction needed to address a particular knowledge problem or vision.

T1  - Teaching physics in a physiologically meaningful manner
AN  - 2550290959
AB  - The learning outcome of a physics laboratory course for medical students was examined in an interdisciplinary field study and discussed for the electrical physiology (“Propagation of Excitation and Nerve Cells”). At the Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich (LMU) at a time about 300 medicine students were assessed in two successive years. Students from the control group worked with standard experiments, while students from the treatment group performed newly developed “addressee-specific” experiments, designed to guide students to transfer physics knowledge to physiological problems. The assessment took place within the laboratory course on physiology, after the students had finished their laboratory classes in physics, and consisted of the construction of a concept map with additional multiple choice questions. The results showed that standard physics experiments are not adequate for teaching students to transfer physical principles to physiology. Introducing new addressee-specific experiments enriched the physics laboratory course by improving student attitudes toward physics and demonstrating better ability of students to relate concepts of physics and medicine, and overall to improve their understanding of the physics taught in the course.

T1  - Entropy and Energy in Characterizing the Organization of Concept Maps in Learning Science
AN  - 1537803914
AB  - Knowledge structures are often represented in the form of networks or maps of concepts. The coherence and connectivity of such knowledge representations is known to be closely related to knowledge production, acquisition and processing. In this study we use network theory in making the clustering and cohesion of concept maps measurable, and show how the distribution of these properties can be interpreted through the Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method. This approach allows to introduce new concepts of the "energy of cognitive load" and the "entropy of knowledge organization" to describe the organization of knowledge in the concept maps.

T1  - Learning Barriers In Service Courses A Mixed Methods Study
AN  - 2318137195
AB  - This paper reports the results of a longitudinal study conducted on a service course offered to non-electrical engineering majors at a large Midwestern university. The study focused on understanding the reasons why students perform relatively low in service courses. The mixed method approach was used to measure the performance in two different ways and then triangulate the results for a deeper understanding of the issue. For the quantitative phase, a closed form questionnaire was developed for the entire class that measured student attitude and their understanding of core concepts related to a specific topic. For the qualitative phase, a concept map was developed for the specific topic for one-on-one interview sessions with a representative sample. The data was collected with the two instruments for five consecutive semesters (n1=253, and n2=44). Our analyses of the data have identified some inherent flaws in the teaching methodology for service courses that contribute towards rote learning. These courses need to be made more relevant and conceptually grounded along with a refocusing of the course content. Moreover, the two instruments developed in this study may form the basis for a broader framework for the formative evaluation of engineering courses.
Interdisciplinary courses commonly known as service courses are offered by almost all engineering departments to meet the ABET’s essential program outcomes criteria 3a-3k to prepare the future engineers for a successful and productive career1, 2. These courses are primarily developed by the departments for non-major engineering students with three main objectives3: 1) to prepare the students to efficiently solve the interdisciplinary problems confronted by entry level engineers in the industry4; 2) to adequately cover the relevant portion of the syllabus for professional certification and registration; and 3) to motivate students to learn engineering concepts related to other fields by generating enough interest in the subject5, 6. The past research shows that motivating the students to learn in service courses is a challenge because most students are unable to understand the link between the knowledge acquired in the service courses and their majors7, 8.
This longitudinal study was conducted on Electronic Instrumentation and Systems (EI&S) course, a typical service course offered by the Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE) department of a large Midwestern university. The objective was to explore and understand the root causes of why students underperform in service courses. The research question formulated for the study was: “What are the learning barriers for non-major engineering students in a service course?” To seek an answer the study attempted to measure student learning in two domains of the Bloom’s taxonomy: cognitive and affective9. For the cognitive domain a specific topic of the course was chosen to gauge student learning of the core concepts. For the affective domain, student attitude towards learning in the service course was measured. For this purpose two instruments were developed: a survey questionnaire for the entire class, and a concept map assignment on the specific topic for one-on-one interview sessions with a representative sample.

T1  - Utilizing Software Generated Concept Maps Based On Customized Concept Inventories To Illustrate Student Learning And Knowledge Gaps
AN  - 2318126540
AB  - Concept inventories have been developed for a variety of disciplines over the last 20 years in order to evaluate student understanding of subjects within the discipline at the conceptual level. Concept inventories have served as a basis for evaluation of student’s fundamental understanding of topics and students’ responses to concept inventories showcase areas where there is need for enrichment. Concept maps are directed graphs that depict the relationships within a discipline and have been used since the 1970s to showcase how knowledge is constructively assembled within a learner’s cognitive structure. Concept maps graphically depict the concepts and relationships within a discipline. Typically, concept maps are constructed by students in order to allow evaluators to understanding learners’ comprehension of the relationships that exist within a discipline. In this paper software is described that has been developed to couple concept inventories with concept maps in order to elicit graphical representations of students’ understanding of a discipline based upon their responses to a custom-designed concept inventory.
This software allows for entry of the questions and answers within a concept inventory and allows each answer to be correlated with a concept or relationship in a concept map. Under this system an expert develops a comprehensive concept map that depicts all of the underlying concepts and relationships within a discipline and then the questions in the concept inventory are tied to the appropriate portions of the concept map. The results of the deployment of the inventory are then depicted in a graphical student map showcasing each individual learner’s mastery of the underlying concepts and relationships as a concept map that is a subset of the comprehensive map. The software also generates aggregate maps based upon various demographics so that performance can be examined on both a student-by-student basis and also at a holistic higher level.
This software has been used in conjunction with a course unit on mechatronics designed to introduce first-semester engineering students to the fundamentals of mechanics and electronics. A comprehensive map has been developed and a corresponding concept inventory has been designed to test student’s knowledge gains through participation in the course unit. The concept inventory has been given as a pre and post test and has also been given in a subsequent semester to evaluate student retention of conceptual knowledge over time. Over 1400 data sets have been collected and analyzed. Within this paper the components of the analysis software are discussed along with some results from data analysis.
A Brief Introduction to Concept Maps
Concept maps are a way of graphically representing the underlying components of a particular field or subfield or, more generally, knowledge [1]. The concepts are enclosed in circles or boxes and lines or arrows linking the boxes indicate the relationship that exists

T1  - Education Theory and Classroom Games: Increasing Knowledge and Fun in the Classroom
AN  - 2655131426
AB  - Theoretical Background Knowles' adult education theory, andragogy, greatly influenced education and changed the way adults were taught.

[...]the 1950s, teachers were perceived to be all-knowing and the students, whether children or adults, needed or wanted to learn the new knowledge.

During the semester, the faculty member used games, as well as case studies, concept mapping, simulation, lectures, and small discussion groups, to vary the stimulus in the classroom setting to enhance the learning process for adult learners.

Five students are selected to be the judges and are responsible for determining the correct answer for each question.

[...]they are the only individuals allowed access to their textbooks and notes.

T1  - Investigating Knowledge Integration in Web-based Thematic Learning Using Concept Mapping Assessment
AN  - 1287035609
AB  - Theme-based learning (TBL) refers to learning modes which adopt the following sequence: (a) finding the theme; (b) finding a focus of interest based on the theme; (c) finding materials based on the focus of interest; (d) integrating the materials to establish shared knowledge; (e) publishing and sharing the integrated knowledge. We have created an on-line system which supports the TBL mode to provide elementary school students with Web-based thematic learning. This study investigated the learning process of 40 fifth grade students in the natural science unit, "Stars and Sun", through the construction of conceptual maps supplemented with structured interviews with both instructors and students on the process and results of the Web-based thematic learning. The following conclusions were reached: (a) the Web-based thematic learning. system has positive effect on learners’ concept learning; (b) the Web-based thematic learning first providing learners with a framework from which develops the related concepts, is a more stable learning mode; (c) the Web-based thematic learning system is suitable for students with different abilities. The middle achievement group of students is particularly suited to using a sharing and observation Web-based learning strategy.

T1  - The Impact on Incorporating Collaborative Concept Mapping with Coteaching Techniques in Elementary Science Classes
AN  - 195207090
AB  - The purpose of this research was to evaluate a collaborative concept-mapping technique that was integrated into coteaching in fourth-grade science classes in order to examine students' performance and attitudes toward the experimental teaching method. There are two fourth-grade science teachers and four classes with a total of 114 students involved in the study. This study used a mixed method design, incorporating both quantitative and qualitative techniques. The findings showed that the two teaching methods obtained significant difference with respect to students' test scores. Using collaborative concept mapping to learn science could increase the opportunity of discussion between peers, thus fostering better organization and understanding the content. In addition, coteaching could enable teachers to share their expertise with one another. It could facilitate the implementation of collaborative concept mapping and the construction of student's concept mapping. Team teachers' attitude could affect the students' learning performance. However, some of the students had negative views on drawing concept maps because they found it was troublesome to write down many words, difficult to draw and arrange proposition, and time-consuming. Coteachers' instant feedback and students' journal writing could guide and examine the students' concept maps to facilitate their cognitive learning. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Musculoskeletal education: a curriculum evaluation at one university
AN  - 902216848; 21143996
AB  - Abstract              Background: The increasing burden of illness related to musculoskeletal diseases makes it essential that attention be paid to musculoskeletal education in medical schools. This case study examines the undergraduate musculoskeletal curriculum at one medical school.              Methods: A case study research methodology used quantitative and qualitative approaches to systematically examine the undergraduate musculoskeletal course at the University of Calgary (Alberta, Canada) Faculty of Medicine. The aim of the study was to understand the strengths and weaknesses of the curriculum guided by four questions: (1) Was the course structured according to standard principles for curriculum design as described in the Kern framework? (2) How did students and faculty perceive the course? (3) Was the assessment of the students valid and reliable? (4) Were the course evaluations completed by student and faculty valid and reliable?              Results : The analysis showed that the structure of the musculoskeletal course mapped to many components of Kern's framework in course design. The course had a high level of commitment by teachers, included a valid and reliable final examination, and valid evaluation questionnaires that provided relevant information to assess curriculum function. The curricular review identified several weaknesses in the course: the apparent absence of a formalized needs assessment, course objectives that were not specific or measurable, poor development of clinical presentations, small group sessions that exceeded normal 'small group' sizes, and poor alignment between the course objectives, examination blueprint and the examination. Both students and faculty members perceived the same strengths and weaknesses in the curriculum. Course evaluation data provided information that was consistent with the findings from the interviews with the key stakeholders.              Conclusions: The case study approach using the Kern framework and selected questions provided a robust way to assess a curriculum, identify its strengths and weaknesses and guide improvements.

T1  - Does the mind map learning strategy facilitate information retrieval and critical thinking in medical students?
AN  - 902216612; 20846442
AB  - Abstract              Background: A learning strategy underutilized in medical education is mind mapping. Mind maps are multi-sensory tools that may help medical students organize, integrate, and retain information. Recent work suggests that using mind mapping as a note-taking strategy facilitates critical thinking. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether a relationship existed between mind mapping and critical thinking, as measured by the Health Sciences Reasoning Test (HSRT), and whether a relationship existed between mind mapping and recall of domain-based information.              Methods: In this quasi-experimental study, 131 first-year medical students were randomly assigned to a standard note-taking (SNT) group or mind map (MM) group during orientation. Subjects were given a demographic survey and pre-HSRT. They were then given an unfamiliar text passage, a pre-quiz based upon the passage, and a 30-minute break, during which time subjects in the MM group were given a presentation on mind mapping. After the break, subjects were given the same passage and wrote notes based on their group (SNT or MM) assignment. A post-quiz based upon the passage was administered, followed by a post-HSRT. Differences in mean pre- and post-quiz scores between groups were analyzed using independent samples t -tests, whereas differences in mean pre- and post-HSRT total scores and subscores between groups were analyzed using ANOVA. Mind map depth was assessed using the Mind Map Assessment Rubric (MMAR).              Results: There were no significant differences in mean scores on both the pre- and post-quizzes between note-taking groups. And, no significant differences were found between pre- and post-HSRT mean total scores and subscores.              Conclusions: Although mind mapping was not found to increase short-term recall of domain-based information or critical thinking compared to SNT, a brief introduction to mind mapping allowed novice MM subjects to perform similarly to SNT subjects. This demonstrates that medical students using mind maps can successfully retrieve information in the short term, and does not put them at a disadvantage compared to SNT students. Future studies should explore longitudinal effects of mind-map proficiency training on both short- and long-term information retrieval and critical thinking.

T1  - A Longitudinal Investigation into the Association of Smoking and Depression Among Adolescents: Exposures, Outcomes, and Auxiliary Hypotheses
AN  - 870508612
AB  - Introduction: The association between smoking and depression has been well established, but the nature of the relationship has not been determined. A synthesis of longitudinal studies examining the onset of smoking and depression among adolescents demonstrated consistent evidence of both smoking predicting depression and depression predicting smoking in multiple populations; however, more work is needed to develop and test the mechanisms associated with the onset of the co-occurrence of smoking and depression. This thesis examines the role of a broad range of potential confounders on the relationship between smoking and depression, and investigates a potential mechanism of effect.    Method: Analyses were conducted using the Nicotine Dependence in Teens (NDIT) cohort which included 1293 students initially aged 12-13 years recruited from all grade seven classes in a convenience sample of ten secondary schools in Montreal, Canada surveyed twenty times over five years. Multiple regressions were performed to examine the temporal relationship of potential confounders on the relationship between smoking and depression and to empirically observe variables that could be intermediate on pathways between smoking and depression. A growth curve model was developed to test the effect of perceived self medication on changes in depression scores over time.    Results: A concept map of the smoking and depression relationship in the NDIT cohort was developed according to the results of proportional hazard and fixed effect regressions in which friend smoking, stress, and anxiety-associated variables were identified as intermediate variables. Perceived self-medication was associated with decelerated rates of change of depressive symptoms over times, suggesting that smoking may increase mean levels of stress and depressive symptoms, but may offer the perception of control.    Conclusion: In concert, this thesis suggests a model in which stress and the perceived control of psychobiological function using cigarettes lead to the development of increased depressive symptoms and increased cigarette use.

T1  - Success in virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams in industry
AN  - 867372084
AB  - In today’s fast-paced and innovation-driven world, the nature of the design problems facing industry often requires the use of cross-disciplinary teams in order to maximize innovation. Assembling face-to-face teams to solve the wide variety of design problems that exist is costly, time-consuming, and sometimes impossible, leaving companies with no choice but to call upon virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams to quickly and cost-effectively solve design problems. These teams are crucial to competitiveness in the future, but virtual team members need a stronger set of skills in order for virtual teams to be successful.   This study answers the research question: What factors contribute to the success of virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams in industry? Three case studies were conducted on three distinctly different pre-existing virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams in industry. One team was designing a process for working virtually, the second was redesigning an existing product to reduce cost, and the third was working as a part of a customer-led virtual team to design a brand new product. Team members completed questionnaires, participated in interviews, and went through observations of their virtual work experiences over a period of six weeks for each team, and a multi-case study analysis was conducted.    The results of this study showed that factors that contribute to the success of virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams fall into three major categories: the context in which teams work, the method by which teams do their work, and the  media by which teams communicate. This study’s framework provides a platform for future research on virtual cross-disciplinary engineering design teams, both in industry and in education. This study also found that virtual teams need (1) strong processes, (2) high-quality team members, and (3) higher performance in general on team success factors, suggesting that processes may be more important than technology.

T1  - A Longitudinal Examination of Middle School Science Learners' Use of Scaffolding In and Around a Dynamic Modeling Tool
AN  - 849314325
AB  - Scaffolding is a term rooted in multiple research communities over decades of development. Customized, contingent support can be provided to learners to enable performances beyond what they can do alone. This dissertation seeks to examine how effectively scaffolds designed to promote articulation (written expressions of learner understanding) actually work, and if this effectiveness and/or the quality of the resulting models changes over time. It longitudinally examines the use of scaffolds designed into a dynamic modeling tool, as it is used by middle school science learners to create, test, and revise models of complex science phenomena like stream ecosystems. This dissertation also reviews the origins of the scaffolding construct, and summarizes conceptions of scaffolding from various lines of research. Scaffolding can be provided by both human and non-human agents, such as computers, which require specialized interface design to ensure maximum effectiveness.    In the study, learners created models in four curriculum units over the seventh and eighth grade school years. Additionally, this dissertation examines the nature of the discussion learners have while using these scaffolds and the frequency and types of interpersonal scaffolds employed during the creation of models. Model quality is also examined using a rubric developed through review of prior research on assessing models and concept maps. Learner pairs' model creation sessions on a computer are captured with screen video and learner audio, and then distilled to transcripts for subsequent coding and analysis, supported by qualitative analysis software.   Articulation scaffolds were found to succeed in promoting articulations and the quality of those articulations improved over time. Learner dialog associated with these written articulations is of reasonable quality but did not improve over time. Quality of model artifacts did improve over time. The overall use of scaffolding by each learner pair was contrasted with that pairs model quality, but no relationship was found.   Software design and classroom implementation implications of these findings are discussed. The frequency of interpersonal scaffolding provided by teachers highlights the need to consider scaffolding holistically and synergistically, with design decisions for software tools made in light of careful analysis as to what human and non-human agents can and should each provide.

T1  - Nature or Nurture? A Characterization of the Knowledge and Practices of In- and Out-of-field Beginning Secondary Physics Teachers
AN  - 822779267
AB  - Previous studies have shown that adequate content knowledge is a necessary, but not sufficient, requirement for affective teaching. While legislation requests teachers to be "highly qualified" in a subject area, such as physics, many teachers are frequently asked to teach in an area when they are not certified through a teaching license to do so. This study uses mixed methods to examine the knowledge of beginning physics teachers. Through semi-structured interviews, classroom observations, and concept maps, the pedagogical content knowledge, subject matter knowledge, and practices of three groups of beginning secondary physics teachers were explored. Data were analyzed qualitatively using cases and quantitatively using descriptive statistics and t-tests, the results of which were combined during the interpretation phase of the research process. The study indicated that, over the first two years of teaching, the in-field group of teachers showed stronger physics content knowledge, a consideration for student difficulties with physics topics, and a positive shift in pedagogical content knowledge impacted by working with students, as compared to the rest of the teachers in the study. This research has implications in the development of secondary physics teachers and in the field of physics education research. Specifically, this research has implications in the physics content support for beginning secondary science teachers, the novice/expert research in physics education research, and the pedagogical preparation of undergraduate students, graduate students, and faculty in physics.

T1  - The development and use of a concept mapping assessment tool with young children on family visits to a live butterfly exhibit
AN  - 817394574
AB  - Although young children are major audiences of science museums, limited evidence exists documenting changes in children's knowledge in these settings due in part to the limited number of valid and reliable assessment tools available for use with this population. The purposes of this study were to develop and validate a concept mapping assessment tool and to use this tool to document the butterfly-related knowledge of young children on unguided family visits to a live butterfly exhibit at a natural history museum. In this study, forty-two children visited the live butterfly exhibit with their families on unguided tours and completed pre- and post-visit concept mapping tasks. During pre- and post-visit mapping sessions, children created and revised concept maps about butterflies using a set of eight butterfly-related concept pictures and provided verbal explanations for each picture pair in their concept maps.    Three raters used three different scoring systems designed for use in this study to evaluate the scientific accuracy of the children's pre- and post-visit maps, including the picture pairs and verbal explanations. Quantitative analyses of the scores indicate that the raters used the three scoring systems with a moderate to high level of consistency. The results also indicate that children significantly increased their butterfly-related knowledge in the live butterfly exhibit regardless of recent prior experience with the exhibit.    Qualitative analyses of children's verbal explanations indicate that children possessed butterfly-related knowledge related to: the needs of butterflies, the life cycle of butterflies, the ecology of butterflies and other insects, the diversity and classification of butterflies and other insects, the threats to and conservation of butterflies, and the social and maternal behavior of butterflies. Although children with different levels of exhibit experience showed similarly high levels of prior and subsequent knowledge, the types of understandings they communicated in their verbal explanations differed somewhat. Surprisingly, children without recent prior exhibit experience showed greater understanding in more areas of butterfly-related knowledge than children with recent prior exhibit experience. The results of this study have implications for the field of science education in general and the field of informal science education in particular.

T1  - Cooperative learning: Attitudes, perceptions, and achievement in a traditional, online, and hybrid instructional setting
AN  - 734815765
AB  - Cooperative learning has been sufficiently studied to be accepted as an effective method of education. Student reception of cooperative learning, and therefore the degree of its success in a given situation, will depend on the mode of delivery. New technology for delivering courses totally online challenges many aspects of traditional education, and is particularly difficult for cooperative learning that relies heavily on intense face-to-face communication among students. This study was conducted to compare cooperative learning in a traditional setting to that in hybrid and online settings. A model for delivering a cooperative learning experience has been developed utilizing concept maps within an upper division college course, History of Biology, as well as a hybrid version of the same course with the cooperative learning module run in a traditional class while the rest of the course remained online. A variation of this model is also being used to compare traditional and hybrid formats of introductory biology courses. The model for cooperative learning worked well for the majority of students. Based on attitudinal results, cooperative learning is equally successful regardless of the amount of face-to-face interaction. Students in the online version of this course were pleased with their cooperative learning experience despite the absence of this interaction. Many stated that it helped them gain a deeper understanding of the material. It also provided students with an environment conducive to peer tutoring and social interaction which is often missing from many online experiences. In each course, an increase in achievement was also indicated. This increase was significant for the hybrid and traditional setting. This model, however, was very challenging for the instructor. The hybrid version of the course was much more user-friendly than its fully online counterpart. This alternative method allows a relatively easy incorporation of cooperative learning for both students and instructor.

T1  - Sensemaking: Conceptual changes, cognitive mechanisms, and structural representations. A qualitative user study
AN  - 733023708
AB  - The purpose of this thesis is to improve our understanding of sensemaking process as a basis for building better systems to assist sensemaking. Sensemaking is the task of creating an understanding of a problem or task so that further actions may be taken in an informed manner. Sensemaking is a pre-requisite for many other tasks such as decision making and problem solving. An important part of sensemaking involves making clear the interrelated concepts and their relationships in a problem or task space.   This research investigated the question of how users create and use structured representations for sensemaking. It proposed and refined an iterative sensemaking model building upon previous sensemaking research, learning theories, cognitive psychology and task-based information seeking and use. In particular, the study focused on the processes, conceptual changes, and cognitive mechanisms used during users‘ sensemaking tasks. The qualitative, multi-case user study investigated how a sample of fifteen users working with news writing and business analysis tasks structure their conceptual space with the assistance of note-taking and concept mapping tools. Data on the sensemaking process were collected from multiple sources including think-aloud protocols, screen movement recordings, interviews, and intermediate and final work products.    Using the iterative sensemaking model as an analytical and descriptive framework, the study captured the often idiosyncratic paths sensemakers took, ranging from planned, systematic to rather random, ad hoc patterns of "search—sensemaking" iterations. Findings also revealed various ways in which the iterations started and exited, which suggested that the heterogeneous patterns of sensemaking lie in the shifts from one iteration to the next, rather than in the iterations themselves. The knowledge structure was updated by accretion, tuning, and restructuring to produce the final knowledge representation and sensemaking product. Several cognitive mechanisms were used in processing new information, examining concepts and relationships, and examining anomalies and inconsistencies. They were used in bottom-up, top-down, and combined fashions to move the processes along and to trigger conceptual changes to the knowledge structure of users.    Based on these findings, the study argues that information system that aimed to assist sensemaking should provide an architecture that links structure, data, and sources that can be represented and manipulated in multiple formats. It should also provide integrated assistances at the task and cognitive mechanism levels.   The research contributes to sensemaking research by extending existing descriptive sensemaking models with an analytical framework that incorporates conceptual changes to the knowledge structure and cognitive mechanisms that trigger the processes and conceptual changes. Furthermore, the research identified core issues in designing information systems to assist sensemaking tasks and suggested design implications for sensemaking tools that may be useful in many settings such as learning, knowledge creation, organization, and sharing.

T1  - Meaningful learning development in student nurses: The traditional nursing care plan versus the concept map care plan approach
AN  - 520223805
AB  - Nurse educators have an important responsibility to prepare students for safe nursing practice. The National League for Nursing advocates the use of innovative, active learning strategies in the educational environment that offer meaningful learning opportunities for students. However, controversy exists related to the effectiveness of the traditional nursing care plan in promoting the development of meaningful learning, and clinical judgment in students. The purpose of this quasi-experimental study was to determine if there was a significant difference in meaningful learning development between baccalaureate nursing students who plan nursing care using a traditional nursing care plan compared to those who plan care using a concept map care plan.   The revised two-factor Study Process Questionnaire that measures the deep approach or meaningful learning, and the surface approach or rote learning was administered in a pre-test/post-test design. The control group participants used a traditional nursing care plan, and the treatment group participants used a concept map care plan in the clinical setting with both groups completing four of the assigned care plans during the quarter. Findings revealed that both care plan groups primarily used the deep approach to learning that demonstrated an intention to understand and achieve competency of the information. The concept map care plan group scores for meaningful learning increased, and the traditional nursing care plan group scores for meaningful learning decreased. Secondarily, both groups used a surface approach to learning that demonstrated the intention of memorizing essential, targeted information for the purpose of reproducing the information, for instance, on an examination. Both groups’ surface approach scores increased, demonstrating more of an intention to do only what was minimally required by the end of the quarter.   There was a statistically significant difference between groups related to the effectiveness of the care plan preparation, level of satisfaction with the care plan process, and recommendation for use in the future. The data support the importance of ensuring effective preparation for the care plan method being used.   Data in this study provided insufficient evidence regarding whether the traditional nursing care plan or concept map care plan contributed more to the development of meaningful learning.

T1  - The Contribution of Constructivist Instruction Accompanied by Concept Mapping in Enhancing Pre-service Chemistry Teachers’ Conceptual Understanding of Chemistry in the Laboratory Course
AN  - 2259586968
AB  - The present study aimed to evaluate whether a chemistry laboratory course called “Laboratory Experiments in Science Education” based on constructivist instruction accompanied with concept mapping enhanced pre-service chemistry teachers’ conceptual understanding. Data were collected from five pre-service chemistry teachers at a university in Ankara by means of a concept test and semi-structured interviews. Results showed that pre-service teachers had some alternative conceptions about chemistry topics. Moreover, using constructivist instruction accompanied with concept maps as an instructional tool was effective to promote conceptual understanding. Participants thought that concept maps were useful especially in recognizing the relation between different chemistry concepts.

T1  - On the Evolution of Journal of Biological Education's Hirsch Index in the New Century
AN  - 1659735071
AB  - Citation analysis has become a proven tool in research evaluation and policy relevant studies. Recently, J.E. Hirsch has suggested a new indicator, one single index for the assessment of the research performance of individual scientists. In a short time, Hirsch' definition was easily adapted to citations of journals and articles. The aim of this study is to discuss both what Hirsch index evolution explains us for Journal of Biological Education (JBE) and biological educational subjects which affect h-index of that journal. A case study is conducted for the h-index of JBE over period 2000-2005. By the term variable citation window h-index it meant that it was considered as a fixed moment in time when citations were collected from Web of Science. The evolution of JBE Hirsch index is shown with the self citations and the elimination of journal self citations in related figures. From the data, the Pearson correlation coefficients of regression lines are determined. The quantitative findings show that the h-index evolution of JBE has a positive trend determined in the case of the self and elimination self-citations of the journal over period 2000-2005. Furthermore, the most cited articles are about understanding of students on biological subjects, developing concept mapping in biology and students' attitutes towards biology teaching.

T1  - An Investigation of Concept Mapping to Improve the Reading Comprehension of Science Texts
AN  - 2259565826
AB  - This study investigated how well 74 6th-grade science students represented text structures from a 900-word textbook chapter on soil conservation, given a concept map template with four superordinate terms and 24 unsorted concepts. Findings suggest students were more successful at classifying pre-selected terms under given superordinate categories than they were at fully identifying relevant concept sets and articulating three different relationship types between terms. No significant differences were noted in the mapping performance of students at different reading levels. About two-third of students indicated they enjoyed concept mapping and would prefer to both read and map rather than just read without mapping. Students also expressed a strong preference for mapping in pairs or small groups compared to mapping alone. Multiple recommendations are provided for improving the relational thinking of students tasked with concept mapping expository science texts, including bridging to more open-ended maps, embedding mapping in longer-term inquiry projects, and leveraging collaborative and tool-based scaffolds.

T1  - A Paradigm For Comprehensive Concept Map Based Modeling Of Student Knowledge
AN  - 2317940650
AB  - The current method of modeling the level of understanding students have of course content with a single letter grade is primitive at best. The simplification of weeks of learning into a single character representation does little to convey what a student ultimately knows. Two students who receive the same grade in a course may, and often do, have a very different level of mastery of various course concepts. This paper presents a new paradigm for knowledge modeling and assessment based on concept maps and concept inventories.
Under this assessment method, student maps are generated to graphically depict a comprehensive model of student understanding of course concepts. This assessment paradigm begins by creating a comprehensive concept map that depicts each of the relevant concepts and relationships within the topic area being studied. Based upon a concept-inventory-driven analysis of student knowledge, a concept map representing the subset of the comprehensive map that students have mastered is generated as a representation of each student’s knowledge.
This paper presents an example of how such an assessment paradigm has been implemented in a mechatronics course unit in a large freshman engineering course. This course unit introduces students to many concepts from electrical, computer, and mechanical engineering. The unit includes an online lecture and a hands-on, lab-based activity in which students build a simple mobile robot. Over 1400 students participated in this course unit in Fall 2008. While the scope of this work is within a single course unit, this paper describes how such modeling can be done on a large scale to represent student knowledge gains in an entire course or even an entire degree program.
The methods used for building the comprehensive concept map and an appropriate concept inventory are described. The software developed to generate student maps based on responses to a concept inventory is also discussed. Many applications of this paradigm are described including the use of such assessment methods to augment university admissions data, the ability to replace or augment transcripts and resumes with detailed student maps, the development of college rankings based on student learning outcomes, and objective faculty teaching evaluation based on student learning outcomes.
Much work has been done in attempting to discover how people learn[1] and the processes involved in general cognition[2]. Concept maps have become more widely used in education as both tools for facilitating student learning[3] and for academic research and knowledge modeling[4]. Concept maps provide a general structure for outlining conceptual knowledge and relationships. Concept maps take on the form of directed graphs where nodes on the graph indicate concepts and the edges of the graph indicate the relationships between those concepts. In Figure 1 a concept map is used to depict the features and utility of concept maps as a modeling tool. Concept maps may be used by students to outline their own understanding of

T1  - Graduate Student Experiences And Mentor Benefits Of The Preparing Future Faculty Program In Engineering
AN  - 2317939218
AB  - The University of Cincinnati (UC) College of Engineering offers a college-wide Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) program to address the need for more qualified faculty in engineering programs and to improve the overall educational environment. The UC PFF program consists of three one-hour courses and a mentored teaching component. The first course, in the Winter Quarter, provides information on basic effective teaching techniques for engineering, including Kolb learning styles, and how to organize a course. In addition, cultural differences and diversity are discussed in the context of science and engineering classes. The advanced teaching class in Spring Quarter emphasizes advanced pedagogical techniques including Bloom's taxonomy, concept maps, project and team management for developing leadership skills, teaching evaluations, proposal writing, and mentoring and being mentored. ABET engineering criteria a-k are applied to syllabus development, and students hold a mock NSF review panel based on a proposed project in engineering education. The final course, in Autumn Quarter, explores the academic job search process and the range of academic careers available. Panel discussions with new faculty, hiring committees from teaching-oriented and research-oriented universities, and recently tenured faculty provide up-to-date information.
This paper focuses on the experience of a PFF student participant during the 2006-2007 academic year, as well as the experiences of and benefits to his PFF program coordinator and academic research mentor. Overall, participating in the program helped the student to prepare for an academic career. Having two faculty mentors in the PFF program activities provided invaluable opportunities and feedback. The mentored teaching activities applied the concepts learned in the PFF courses. The individualized mentored teaching experience included teaching undergraduate and graduate courses, giving talks at research seminars, and mentoring senior projects and REU (Research Experience for Undergraduates) students in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at UC. Various methods of active learning, motivating students, problem-based active laboratory learning, and peer tutoring were explored and applied to mentor students. The paper also includes feedback from the PFF program coordinator and the academic research mentor.
I. Introduction
Preparing Future Faculty (PFF) is a national initiative to better prepare Ph.D., M.S., and postdoctoral students to pursue careers in academia as the next generation of college and university professors.1 The PFF program was started in 1993 and is now established at 45 doctoral institutions and 300 partner schools.1 The program is designed to improve the graduate educational experience and to address the need for more qualified and trained faculty at various academic institutions. UC was one of the original doctoral institutions and an active participant with a university-wide PFF program since 1993.2,3 The UC PFF in Engineering program

T1  - Students’ Learning Satisfaction And Progress Toward A Nanometer Course, Employing A Concept Mapping Learning Web Platform
AN  - 2317936476
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore students’ learning satisfaction when applying concept mapping with computer assisted teaching tools and to reveal students’ learning progress in Nanometer course. The research method adopted in depth interviews. A total of six participants from the Nanometer course at National Kaohsiung University of Applied Sciences in Taiwan participated in interviews lasting 30 to 60 minutes. The research results revealed that students satisfied with the concept mapping instruction in the Nanometer course. The concept mapping instruction did effectively improve students’ comprehension and retention memories as well as inspire students’ learning interests and enthusiasm for Nanometer technology. Additionally, students also agreed that concept mapping instruction is an applicable approach to be applied into other professional fields or self-applications besides the science-related subjects. Finally, results even further indicated the deficiencies and suggestions proposed from students for concept mapping instruction. Key-words Concept mapping instruction, Nanometer course, learning satisfaction, learning progress
INTRODUCTION Concept Mapping has received considerable attention in education fields during the past decade, which has been under discussion about approval and recognition as a useful teaching and learning approach. In a bunch of previous researches, most researchers indicated that concept mapping successfully and effectively reinforced students’ conceptual integrated knowledge (Chang, 2007; Chiu, 2004; Freeman, 2004; Marchand, D’Ivernois, Assal, Slama & Hivon, 2002). Moreover, concept mapping has been demonstrated to be a successful learning tool towards science related subjects since it includes the visual learning and computer assisted tools, such as power point, animations, video, audio, web pages, e-books, blogs, and digital courses to stimulate students’ learning preferences and learning performances (Alpert & Grueneberg, 2000; Barker, 2005; Guastello, Beasley & Sinatra, 2000; Kinchin, 2006; Kinchin, 2000; Laigh, 2004; Zele, 2004). As a result, the benefits of concept mapping instruction have been always taken as an important core by a number of scholars mentioned above from many different viewpoints. 1

T1  - Quantifying Learning Through The Use Of Mind Maps And Concept Maps
AN  - 2317922712
AB  - In this work mind maps and concept maps will be used to facilitate the process of learning by quantifying the ability of students to connect existing memories to new concepts. Research from cognitive and neural science indicates that learning occurs through the repeated process of storing, retrieving, and connecting information. Aligning instruction with the way in which students learn is difficult. Instruction is often delivered using a topic-by-topic presentation of material because the instructor’s expertise in a field, coupled with repeated application of concepts, facilitates this approach. Instructors are able to quickly and easily retrieve information because they have a vast network of neural paths developed through repeated use. Students, on the other hand, are faced with both establishing the connection of stored information to new concepts and strengthening the connection with repeated use. If the connection between retrieved information and the new concept is made, learning will occur—otherwise it will not. This research explores the use of mind maps and concept maps as quantitative tools to measure the learning process of students and to identify important missing connections between concepts.
Introduction The questions which this paper attempts to answer are: how can mind maps, or concept maps, be used to assess the level of student conceptual understanding, and how can the information obtained through the evaluation of students be made use of to improve student learning and instructional methods?
Mind maps and concept maps, while similar in that they are both graphical representations of cognitive processes, are different in their structures and functionality. Mind maps consist of clusters of ideas emanating from a central topic using branching. Concept maps are graphical representations of knowledge using a combination of directed arcs and labels which link related information. Mind maps better facilitate spontaneity and creativity while concept maps better facilitate identification of relationships between constituents of a body of knowledge. Particularly important is the distinction that concept maps rely on the creator’s ability to connect related information; mind maps do not require linking of any information.
Mind maps have been used to help students create visual representations of their thinking 1 2 3 patterns in sociology , economics , and psychology classes , and they have been used as 4 5 assessment tools in chemistry classes and biology classes . Engineering educators have likewise 6,7 examined the use of concept maps in assessment .

T1  - Thomson Reuters maps new relationships in learning and collaboration: Software helps company to keep track of various threads and aspects of training
AN  - 214904366
AB  - The paper aims to highlight how the global head of learning at Thomson Reuters uses mind maps to keep track of the different threads and aspects of training throughout the worldwide, 50,000-employee company. The paper explains how mind maps work and describes how computer software can improve their efficiency. The paper details the way in which software can help in searching for the most relevant or up-to-date file, since all relevant documents, presentations, pictures and so on can be attached to the map. It shows that the maps themselves can be exported to programs such as Microsoft Office, PowerPoint or Project, and that the manager, or an individual team member, can break down the big picture by selecting filters - for example, to look at just one person's tasks and deadlines or to pick up on the next set of priorities. The paper describes how Thomson Reuters is creating a one-stop shop for all the rules and structures used for buying and selling financial instruments in different countries, where people can check the rules, find what rules might apply to new products by reference to similar products or cross-reference the rules in different jurisdictions. The paper provides an example of training and development in a very topical sector.

T1  - Understanding of Earth and Space Science Concepts: Strategies for Concept-Building in Elementary Teacher Preparation
AN  - 195213899
AB  - This research is concerned with preservice teacher understanding of six earth and space science concepts that are often taught in elementary school: the reason for seasons, phases of the moon, why the wind blows, the rock cycle, soil formation, and earthquakes. Specifically, this study examines the effect of readings, hands-on learning stations, and concept mapping in improving conceptual understanding. Undergraduates in two sections of a science methods course (N=52) completed an open-ended survey, giving explanations about the above concepts three times: as a pretest and twice as posttests after various instructional interventions. The answers, scored with a three point rubric, indicated that the preservice teachers initially had many misconceptions (alternative conceptions). A two way ANOVA with repeated measures analysis (pretest/posttest) demonstrated that readings and learning stations are both successful in building preservice teacher's understanding and that benefits from the hands-on learning stations approached statistical significance. Concept mapping had an additive effect in building understanding, as evident on the second posttest. The findings suggest useful strategies for university science instructors to use in clarifying science concepts while modeling activities teachers can use in their own classrooms.

T1  - Incremental Improvement of the Evaluation Algorithm in the Concept Map Based Knowledge Assessment System
AN  - 2518397039
AB  - The paper is devoted to the knowledge assessment system that has been developed at the Department of Systems Theory and Design of Riga Technical University for the last four years. The system is based on concept maps that allow displaying the knowledge structure of a particular learner in the form of a graph. Teacher’s created concept maps serve as a standard against which learner’s concept maps are compared. However, it is not correct to compare teacher’s and learners’ concept maps by examining the exact equivalence of relationships in both maps, because people construct knowledge in different ways. Thus, an appropriate mechanism is needed for the flexible evaluation of learners’ concept maps. The paper describes the algorithm implemented in the concept map based knowledge assessment system and its evolution through four prototypes of the system.

T1  - Leibniz and The Logic of Life
AN  - 878555506
AB  - Nachtomy comments on the article "Leibniz and the Logic of Life" by Catherine Wilson wherein she argues against an influential teaching in the history of science that biology did not exist as a science before 1750, and that there was no concept of life before that date which might have justified the establishment of such a branch of study. Among others, an analogy was developed with the assumption underlying the comparisons with the metaphysical concept of life of Leibniz and contemporary biologists who consider living beings to be individuals. These three points of analogy are: Leibniz's usage of a substantial form functioning as a consitutive program for the development of individuals and the contemporary notion of a genetic program; the notion of such developmental program as a distinct mark of living beings for both Leibniz and contemporary biologist; and Leibniz's definition of possible individuals through their complete concepts and the notion of "sequence space" in contemporary genomic theory.

T1  - Artistic Approaches to Environmental Education: Developing Eco-art Education in Elementary Classrooms
AN  - 808584037
AB  - This dissertation explores curriculum development in eco-art education, an integration of art education and environmental education, as a means of increasing awareness of and engagement with learning about the environment. The creation of eco-art curricula in school settings was investigated by tracking how elementary teachers' knowledge and understanding of eco-art education resulted in learning experiences for their students.    Guided by the frameworks of collaborative action research and arts-informed research, a team of four elementary teachers and a university-based educator exchanged and generated practical and theoretical knowledge in order to plan, implement, observe and reflect on the development of eco-art curricula over the span of a school year. By drawing on the expertise and experience of the team members, the research aimed to acknowledge the central role teachers play in the design of innovative curricula and pedagogy and maximize the benefits inherent in school-university partnerships.    Data was collected in four schools over the course of nine months, and analyzed, interpreted and shared through a combination of thematic analysis, concept-mapping and arts-informed research strategies. As the first dissertation to examine eco-art learning in a sustained way across multiple school sites, it offers evidence to demonstrate that eco-art curricula can take a multitude of forms and promote environmental learning in a variety of ways. The extensive database of elementary eco-art lessons created as part of the study highlights the roles of collaboration, place-based learning, systems-thinking and stewardship in eco-art learning, as well as the importance of using biodegradable materials and natural processes in making eco-art with children.    Presented as a combination of text and imagery, this dissertation also makes connections between the study and the author's ongoing work in community arts and guerilla art gardening as a means to elucidate the praxis of eco-art education. In this, eco-art education is shown to offer an innovative means for teachers to weave together learning about art and the environment in school-based settings.

T1  - A meta -analytical review of Novak's concept mapping
AN  - 305136984
AB  - The current systematic review furthers the field of Novak's concept mapping founded on Ausubel meaningful learning theory. Based upon 46 effects from 38 studies, the results indicate that Novak's concept maps are effective learning tools for enhancing and promoting achievement among students. Within the learning domains of Science, English/English as a Second Language, Education, and Electives, concept mapping improves achievement. However, within the learning domain of Math, concept mapping groups did not demonstrate improvement of achievement. Both computer-generated and non-computer generated maps are effective means for creating maps, though non-computer-generated maps were slightly more effective. Suggestions for future research by learning domain and by means of map generation are included.

T1  - Emotional coping and literacy intervention decisions: How hearing parents guide their deaf children
AN  - 305130774
AB  - This qualitative case study investigated the process by which eight hearing parents went about making decisions to promote language acquisition and literacy learning in their deaf children, who or what influenced that process, and how they coped emotionally with the impact of deafness on literacy and language acquisition. Data from interview transcripts were analyzed to isolate common influences across cases. Concept maps were also used to explore relationships between these influences. It was found that over time, parents came to rely on themselves because they were often disappointed by the medical community and educational-placement agencies. Research, site visits, and the influence of trusted educators all served to educate and guide the parents, especially as they grew more concerned about the influence of their children’s intellectual and social peer groups. Signing was generally recognized as beneficial by families, though in some cases it also caused tensions. Finally, as parents made site visits to schools, some encountered what they perceived to be forms of extremism that disturbed them.

T1  - Examining standardized terminology to support evidence based nursing practice for patients with depressive symptoms in primary care
AN  - 305036028
AB  - The purpose of this study was to explore how standardized nursing terminologies (SNTs) represented Evidence Based Practice (EBP) recommendations for adults with depression in primary care and to describe nursing practice for patients with depressive symptoms as represented in a SNT. The Aurora Cerner University of Wisconsin-Knowledge Based Nursing Initiative (ACW-KBNI) conceptual framework was used to guide this study.    A mixed methods design using quantitative and qualitative methods was used to answer the study questions. EBP recommendations were mapped to two SNTs through lexical and semantic concept mapping and expert review. Nursing practice documentation represented by SNT, within a clinical information system (CIS), at a community nursing center (CNC), was analyzed using descriptive statistics. The CIS data were examined for adult patients with depressive symptoms. The final component of the study was a qualitative analysis comparing the findings from the mappings of the EBP recommendations to SNT with the findings from the CIS data analysis. A content analysis was conducted to identify areas of similarity and differences between the mappings and the CIS documentation of practice.    Study findings included 92% of the EBP recommendation key concepts were able to be mapped at a semantic level to one of the SNTs. Most (80.5%) of the mappings were partial semantic (conceptual meaning) of the concepts. This finding raises concern with the ambiguity that could occur because of partial mappings.    The findings from the CIS identified 685 unique patients seen at the CNC over a period of 30 months. Thirty three (4.3%) of patients met the study criteria for patients with depressive symptoms. Findings from the assessment, diagnoses, interventions, and outcomes included a higher frequency of mental health problems in the sub sample, with the most frequent intervention being Teaching, Guidance, and Counseling. The final component of the study compared the two data sets. The findings were conceptually a comparison was possible but the level of specificity was of concern.    Recommendations for future practice, research, education, and policy were discussed. Future research is needed to explore the process of mapping EBP recommendations to SNTs. Researchers also need to explore development of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) within the CIS. CDSS has the potential to improve the consistency and clarity of documentation. The use of SNT within CIS has the potential to improve the description of nursing practice and the impact of nursing on patient outcomes.

T1  - Teaching taboo topics without talking about them: An epistemic study of a new approach to HIV /AIDS prevention education in India
AN  - 304999967
AB  - Background. Solving the problem of how to provide effective health education on diseases subject to social taboos is an immediate need. The social stigma of HIV/AIDS is particularly prominent in the developing world, where 95 percent of all HIV-infected persons live. Millions of people are risking death from HIV/AIDS while cultures and laws resist change. New approaches must be created to provide education despite whatever social, structural, cultural, and legal barriers exist. Fortunately, the emergence of new media and information and communication technologies (ICT) has provided new ways to help bypass social taboos and provide effective education in ways which were not possible in the past. This dissertation discusses these challenges and presents criteria for evaluating the efficacy of various educational campaigns aimed at promoting awareness relating to taboo topics using a specially designed HIV/AIDS curriculum—Interactive Teaching AIDS—as an exemplar. In health interventions, knowledge is a necessary, although seldom sufficient, step to bring about changes in attitudes and behaviors.    The Interactive Teaching AIDS (ITA) application was developed, tested, and optimized over a two-year period to promote HIV/AIDS education despite social and cultural challenges. It incorporates key pedagogical and communication theories and approaches in order to maximize its efficacy. To provide psychological comfort and promote coherent understanding, this ICT-based application couples the presentation of biological aspects of transmission with culturally-familiar euphemisms and metaphors to communicate ideas about prevention measures. Through a rigorous, iterative, research-based process, the 20-minute application provides detailed yet accessible culturally-appropriate explanations of all key aspects of HIV/AIDS prevention. The process included the development of multiple prototypes and over 150 iterations in total, starting with concept maps, screenplays, storyboards, and low-fidelity paper prototypes, eventually leading to interactive versions of the curriculum in multiple media, including a final version in Adobe Flash.    Methodology. High school and college students ( N=386) from New Delhi, Haryana, and Punjab, were randomly selected across four institutes in India. No one refused to participate. Students at three of the four institutes were assigned to the intervention group, and students at the fourth institute were assigned to the control group. Intervention students received the ITA application. All students received a baseline pretest, followed by an immediate posttest, and finally a retention test one month later to assess outcomes. The assessments measured knowledge of HIV transmission and prevention methods as well as attitudes regarding social acceptance of those infected with the virus.    Results. Experimental students exhibited statistically significant gains in posttest knowledge (p<.001) and positive changes in attitudes (p<.001), even after controlling for pretest knowledge, gender, mother's education and father's education. One month later, the experimental students retained significant amounts of prevention knowledge (p<.001) and displayed positive changes in attitudes (p<.05). On the 40-item knowledge assessment, the experimental group scored 8.25 points higher than the control group participants during the posttest, and 7.03 points higher during the retention test. At onset, males performed significantly better on the pretest than females ( p<.01), however, after interacting with the ITA application, there was no differences between the knowledge gained and retained by males or females in the posttest or retention test, closing the achievement gap. Although HIV/AIDS is generally considered a taboo topic to discuss throughout India, 98.6 percent of intervention students indicated they were comfortable learning from the application, and 94.5 percent said they learned more about prevention through the ITA tutorial than through any other prior communications channel, including television and school. Results revealed that after watching the animated tutorial, a significantly greater proportion of intervention students indicated they felt less afraid of interacting with HIV-infected people rather than feeling more afraid (p<.001) and were less afraid of being infected with HIV rather than more afraid (p<.001). One month later, students exposed to the intervention were significantly more likely to share information with others (p<.001) and were actively seeking additional HIV/AIDS information on their own (p<.001).    Conclusion. For people living in areas that cannot easily access explicit HIV/AIDS materials due to social, cultural or other constraints, these results suggest that it is possible to design curricula that are socially-acceptable and accurate, that promote significant gains in learning, retention, and changes in attitudes. Furthermore these materials can encourage learners to proactively seek more information regarding the taboo topic and share prevention information with others. Educators who are reticent to teach about such subjects due to embarrassment or lack of health expertise can utilize such applications to educate students. Such efforts can also close the knowledge gap between female and male learners.

T1  - The effect of team training strategies on team mental model formation and team performance under routine and non-routine environmental conditions
AN  - 304987386
AB  - The current study examined how the type of training a team receives (team coordination training vs. cross-training) influences the type of team mental model structures that form and how those mental models in turn impact team performance under different environmental condition (routine vs. non-routine). Three-hundred and fifty-two undergraduate students from a large northeastern university participated in the current study (176 dyads). Data were collected through the NeoCITIES simulation, which is a simulated task environment of an emergency management team. Team training was manipulated across subjects while environmental condition was manipulated within subjects. Findings indicated that training type had no main effect on team mental models but did have a significant impact on performance. Specifically, dyads exposed to cross-training had higher levels of performance than those that received team coordination training. In addition, team mental models had a significant main effect on performance, such that the increased accuracy and sharedness of situation mental models, the increased sharedness of teamwork mental models, and the increased accuracy of taskwork mental models resulted in higher levels of performance. Surprisingly, the increased sharedness of taskwork mental models was also found to decrease performance. Finally, contrary to previous findings, the effect of team mental models on team performance was not moderated by environmental condition. The results from ancillary analyses evaluating the relationship between team training and performance and team mental models and performance are discussed, along with the limitations and implications of these findings.

T1  - Using concept maps to explore preservice teachers' perceptions of science content knowledge, teaching practices, and reflective processes
AN  - 304922282
AB  - This qualitative study examined seven preservice teachers' perceptions of their science content knowledge, teaching practices, and reflective processes through the use of the metacognitive strategy of concept maps. Included in the paper is a review of literature in the areas of preservice teachers' perceptions of teaching, concept development, concept mapping, science content understanding, and reflective process as a part of metacognition.    The key questions addressed include the use of concept maps to indicate organization and understanding of science content, mapping strategies to indicate perceptions of teaching practice, and the influence of concept maps on reflective process. There is also a comparison of preservice teachers' perceptions of concept map usage with the purposes and practices of maps as described by experienced teachers. Data were collected primarily through interviews, observations, a pre and post concept mapping activity, and an analysis of those concept maps using a rubric developed for this study.    Findings showed that concept map usage clarified students' understanding of the organization and relationships within content area and that the process of creating the concept maps increased participants' understanding of the selected content. The participants felt that the visual element of concept mapping was an important factor in improving content understanding. These participants saw benefit in using concept maps as planning tools and as instructional tools. They did not recognize the use of concept maps as assessment tools. When the participants were able to find personal relevance in and through their concept maps they were better able to be reflective about the process. The experienced teachers discussed student understanding and skill development as the primary purpose of concept map usage, while they were able to use concept maps to accomplish multiple purposes in practice.

T1  - Cognitive development in introductory physics: A research-based approach to curriculum reform
AN  - 304880340
AB  - This project describes the research on a classification of physics problems in the context of introductory physics courses. This classification, called the Taxonomy of Introductory Physics Problems (TIPP), relates physics problems to the cognitive processes required to solve them. TIPP was created for designing and clarifying educational objectives, for developing assessments that can evaluate individual component processes of the problem-solving process, and for guiding curriculum design in introductory physics courses, specifically within the context of a “thinking-skills” curriculum. TIPP relies on the following resources: (1) cognitive research findings adopted by physics education research, (2) expert-novice research discoveries acknowledged by physics education research, (3) an educational psychology taxonomy for educational objectives, and (4) various collections of physics problems created by physics education researchers or developed by textbook authors.   TIPP was used in the years 2006–2008 to reform the first semester of the introductory algebra-based physics course (called Phys 11) at The George Washington University. The reform sought to transform our curriculum into a “thinking-skills” curriculum that trades “breadth for depth” by focusing on fewer topics while targeting the students’ cognitive development. We employed existing research on the physics problem-solving expert-novice behavior, cognitive science and behavioral science findings, and educational psychology recommendations.   Our pedagogy relies on didactic constructs such as the GW-ACCESS  problem-solving protocol, learning progressions and concept maps that we have developed and implemented in our introductory physics course. These tools were designed based on TIPP. Their purpose is: (1) to help students build local and global coherent knowledge structures, (2) to develop more context-independent problem-solving abilities, (3) to gain confidence in problem solving, and (4) to establish connections between everyday phenomena and underlying physics concepts. We organize traditional and research-based physics problems such that students experience a gradual increase in complexity related to problem context, problem features and cognitive processes needed to solve the problem. The instructional environment that we designed allows for explicit monitoring, control and measurement of the cognitive processes exercised during the instruction period. It is easily adaptable to any kind of curriculum and can be readily adjusted throughout the semester.   To assess the development of students’ problem-solving abilities, we created rubrics that measure specific aspects of the thinking involved in physics problem solving. The Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey (CLASS) was administered pre- and post-instruction to determine students’ shift in dispositions towards learning physics. The Force Concept Inventory (FCI) was administered pre- and post-instruction to determine students’ level of conceptual understanding. The results feature improvements in students’ problem-solving abilities and in their attitudes towards learning physics.

T1  - Using a Conceptual Approach with a Concept Map of Psychosis as an Exemplar to Promote Critical Thinking
AN  - 2790005545
AB  - Teaching students to think critically is an important component of nursing education. A literature review suggests that a conceptual approach and a concept map may help facilitate critical thinking in the nursing student. Currently, there are patients in various health care settings who manifest psychosis and need treatment for the disorder. This article proposes using both a concept map and a conceptual approach to teach the concept of psychosis instead of focusing on content. If students understand the general concept of psychosis, they can identify and implement nursing actions for patients with psychosis regardless of the etiology or health care setting.

T1  - Visualization In Science Education: The Results Of Pilot Research In Grade 10
AN  - 2343816450
AB  - The modern visualization is created to help in education processes and is oriented to the evaluation of knowledge. It is very important for science education to have perfectly prepared aids that could show invisible phenomena and could foster deeper motivation. The more images there are in education process the better pupils understand and realize information. This article encloses that visualization was popular in biology lessons and in physics, but teachers did not use computer based visualization and students did not use concept mapping in chemistry classes. Students had similar conditions to learn science in grade 10 and their opinion is generalised in the article.

T1  - Chemistry Teachers' And Students' Perceptions Of Practical Work Through Different Ict Learning Environments
AN  - 2343816382
AB  - This paper presents the first phase of a design research, where four practical work activities within ICT learning environments (concept maps, molecular modeling, animations and videos) were created and evaluated. Materials were designed carefully after the orientation of research literature and Finnish chemistry curriculum by 21 chemistry student teachers during their M.Sc. chemistry education course. Designed materials were peer evaluated before they were presented to 27 teachers and students who made their external evaluation. Research questions of the research were i) What kind of need is there for creating learning environments that connect practical chemistry and ICT?, ii) What kind of features does meaningful practical work through different ICT -learning environments contain? And iii) What kind of effect does practical work through ICT have on chemistry learning according to chemistry teachers and students? Data was gathered by observing and using questionnaires. This study shows that the need for meaningful practical work through ICT -learning environments is substantial. According to the designers and respondents, meaningful characteristics of practical working through ICT are i) cooperative, ii) constructivist, iii) motivating, and iv) time saving and safe, In addition, they should visualize chemical phenomenon and processes at macro and molecular levels. Studied teachers found that ICT gives i) important aid to learning and teaching practical work, ii) it arouses interest and iii) it develops research skills. At the second phase of this research, activities will be developed to more contextual and inquiry-based form and the effect on learning will be examined thoroughly with comprehensive school students.

T1  - The Effect of Applying Elements of Instructional Design on Teaching Material for the Subject of Classification of Matter
AN  - 1288351944
AB  - The aim of this study was to examine the effect of instructional materials for the subject of classification of matter as solids, liquids and gases that were developed using a holistic instructional design model on student achievement. In the study a pre-test/post-test with control group experimental design was used. The study was conducted in the 2004-2005 school year using a sample of 120 students in the 7th grade (Experimental group 1=30, Experimental group 2=30, Control group 1=30, and Control group 2=30). At the beginning of the study a prior knowledge test, science attitude scale and Multiple Intelligence Fields Determination Scale were completed by the students. At the end of the study an achievement determination questionnaire was completed by the students in the experimental and control groups. Instructional material including student worksheets, student practice questions and a teacher guide were prepared by the researchers on the Freehand MXa program. In teaching the subject to the experimental groups, a holistic instructional approach was used that combined reliance on multiple intelligence theory, a constructivist approach, deliberate use of analogies and an emphasis on science process skills. In addition, concept maps and an animation were used. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, one-way analysis of variance, Cohen's size effect, and the Scheffe Test with the SPSS 11.00 program at the .05 significance level. At the beginning of the study, it was found that while there was no statistically significant difference between the students of the experimental and control groups, at the end of the study levels of achievement of the students on this subject in the two experimental groups were higher than both control groups.

T1  - Combining different conceptual change methods within 5E model: A sample teaching design of 'cell' concept and its organelles
AN  - 1957088889
AB  - Since students' misconceptions are not completely remedied by means of only one conceptual change method, the authors assume that using different conceptual methods embedded within the 5E model will not only be more effective in enhancing students' conceptual understanding, but also may eliminate all students' misconceptions. The aim of this study is to display a sample teaching of the cell and its organelles by combining different conceptual change methods (analogy, conceptual change text and worksheet) within the 5E model. But, the study has a shortcoming in seeking the degree to which conceptual change is achieved. For this reason, further research should focus on applicability of the presented teaching design in a comparative manner.

T1  - Arguing Online: Case Studies of Pre-Service Science Teachers' Perceptions of Online Tools in Supporting the Learning of Arguments
AN  - 1658509042
AB  - Argumentation as a form of scientific discourse has been advocated as a key goal in science teaching. Information and communication technology (ICT) has been proposed as a vehicle to achieve pedagogic objectives in scientific argumentation. However, ICT as a new tool is likely to be ineffective when other factors are not taken into consideration. The empirical study described in this paper aims to investigate the use of ICT to support teaching and learning of argumentation from the users' perspectives. Four science pre-service teachers training as teachers at a postgraduate certificate in education programme in England have been introduced to a computer software called Belvedere 4.1, a tool designed particularly for supporting argumentation. The participants were tasked to produce a concept map with Belvedere 4.1, and subsequently they were invited to comment on the utility of Belvedere. Interviews with the participants explored their personal factors, pedagogic beliefs and experiences of using ICT in general in their teaching practice. The results indicate that the external conditions will limit the possibility of the use of ICT to improve teaching and learning of argumentation. Both the design and the structure of Belvedere, as well as the participants' personal factors contribute to the usability of the tool.

T1  - The Influence of Mind Mapping on Eighth Graders' Science Achievement
AN  - 195214758
AB  - This study assessed the influence of using mind maps as a learning tool on eighth graders' science achievement, whether such influence was mediated by students' prior scholastic achievement, and the relationship between students' mind maps and their conceptual understandings. Sixty-two students enrolled in four intact sections of a grade 8 science classroom were randomly assigned to experimental and comparison conditions. Participants in the experimental group received training in, and constructed, mind maps throughout a science unit. Engagement with mind mapping was counterbalanced with involving the comparison group participants with note summarization to control for time on task as a confounding variable.

T1  - Student Use of Scaffolding Software: Relationships with Motivation and Conceptual Understanding
AN  - 2259580336
AB  - This study was designed to theoretically articulate and empirically assess the role of computer scaffolds. In this project, several examples of educational software were developed to scaffold the learning of students performing high level cognitive activities. The software used in this study, Artemis, focused on scaffolding the learning of students as they performed information seeking activities. As 5th grade students traveled through a project-based science unit on photosynthesis, researchers used a pre-post design to test for both student motivation and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. To measure both variables, a motivation survey and three methods of concept map analysis were used. The student use of the scaffolding features was determined using a database that tracked students’ movement between scaffolding tools. The gain scores of each dependent variable was then correlated to the students’ feature use (time and hits) embedded in the Artemis Interface. This provided the researchers with significant relationships between the scaffolding features represented in the software and student motivation and conceptual understanding of photosynthesis. There were a total of three significant correlations in comparing the scaffolding use by hits (clicked on) with the dependent variables and only one significant correlation when comparing the scaffold use in time. The first significant correlation (r = .499, p < .05) was between the saving/viewing features hits and the students’ task value. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the saving/viewing features and the students’ perception of how interesting, how important, and how useful the task is. The second significant correlation (r = 0.553, p < 0.01) was between the searching features hits and the students’ self-efficacy for learning and performance. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the searching features and the students’ perception of their ability to accomplish a task as well as their confidence in their skills to perform that task. The third significant correlation (r = 0.519, p < 0.05) was between the collaborative features hits and the students’ essay performance scores. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the collaborative features and the students’ ability to perform high cognitive tasks. Finally, the last significant correlation (r = 0.576, p < 0.01) was between the maintenance features time and the qualitative analysis of the concept maps. This correlation supports the assumption that there is a positive relationship between the student use of the maintenance features and student conceptual understanding of photosynthesis.

AB  - Biomass of lignocellulosic nature is one of the most important resources for sustainable development, owing to its renewable character, low cost, and widespread availability. Lignocellulosic biomass can be used as raw material for the chemical industry to produce a variety of commercial products that are currently manufactured using dwindling, fossil-based resources. Moreover, replacing chemicals obtained from petroleum with alternative materials obtained from renewable resources provides the opportunity to introduce basic principles of sustainable development to students, a topic that is being increasingly incorporated in university curricula. Here, Parajo et al teach sustainable development concepts in the laboratory.

T1  - Using Course Maps To Enhance Navigation Of E Learning Environments
AN  - 2317722449
AB  - A concept map is a graphical representation of relationships among concepts. Willis and Miertschin suggested the use of technology-based concept mapping as an active learning strategy that can enhance learning and thinking skills, particularly among students native to a digital environment [16]. In addition, modern concept mapping software tools enable instructors and students to create visual navigation structures through complex knowledge domains. The authors find value in visual navigation structures for their relevance to organizing and simplifying learning environments and for their appeal to visual learners. This paper investigates different ways to develop digital interactive concept maps (CMaps) to help students navigate complex knowledge domains, such as the content of a course or a curriculum. CMaps can be used to present information in a nonsequential way or in several different ways, depending on the need. Interactivity enables students to easily locate digital information artifacts pertinent to a concept (media files, slide presentations, web pages, etc.) by clicking on links associated with a CMap node representing the course concept or category. A review of recent literature is provided, different software tools are compared, and the authors document their personal experience. This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant No. 0511672.
Complex Learning Environments
Information and communications technologies (ICT) have advanced together so that anyone with a computer connected to the Internet is able to create and/or consume varied format information stored in digital files. As a result, resource-based learning, which is not new but is enabled by ICT, has come of age. A resource-based learning environment (RBLE) is described as “an integrated set of strategies to promote student-centered learning in a mass education context, through a combination of specially designed learning resources and interactive media and technologies” [5]. What is described here is an environment that increasing numbers of higher education faculty find they are challenged to create and manage. Typically, a faculty member is armed with their personal content knowledge and personal experiences with education and learning; traditional learning material such as a textbook; a learning management system; access to computer technologies for content creation together with, sometimes, support staff; and the wealth of information and tools that are freely and readily available via the Internet. With these, the faculty member is expected to create course structures that incorporate these elements, enabling students to enthusiastically consume as needed from the plethora of available information and make sense of it in a way that demonstrates they have met the course learning goals. This task is sometimes arduous for faculty members whose own educational experiences, especially at the undergraduate level, were primarily interactions with faculty in a teacher- centered learning environment where the instructor’s job was to dispense content and evaluate the student’s mastery of the content. Once a faculty member has course material in place in the learning management system, her expectations are high with regard to the level at which the student will be involved with the course and the materials offered.

T1  - Fostering primary school students' understanding of cells and other related concepts with interactive computer animation instruction accompanied by teacher and student-prepared concept maps
AN  - 1957086443
AB  - The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of instruction (application) including interactive computer animation accompanied by teacher and student-prepared concept maps on primary students' biology achievement during instruction, as well as revealing attitudes towards science as a school subject. A quasi-experimental pre-test/post-test control group design was used in this study. The experimental group had 31 students and the control group had 34 students. The experimental group received instruction including interactive computer animation accompanied by teacher- and student-prepared concept maps, while the control group received traditional instruction. A biology achievement test and an attitude scale toward science were used as data collection instruments. The present study indicates that the experimental group had significantly higher scores than the control group in the biology achievement test (regarding cells and other related concepts). Regarding students' attitudes toward science as a school subject, there was no significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the pre- and post-test results. However there was a statistically significant difference between the gain scores of the control group and the experimental group in favor of the experimental group.

T1  - An Exploratory Study of Elementary Preservice Teachers' Understanding of Ecology Using Concept Maps
AN  - 233046204
AB  - Classroom teachers serve a critical role in developing environmentally literate citizens. In this study, the authors assessed K-8 preservice teachers' understanding of basic ecological concepts. Participants (N = 56) constructed concept maps describing the inter-relationships among 16 ecological concepts. The authors analyzed the concept maps to determine how participants organized, associated, and described relationships between the concepts. Although there was a lack of consistency in associating pairs of concepts, participants often created 2 clusters of concepts: a food web cluster and an ecosystem cluster. Associated pairs were often used in similar ways to describe the relationship among concepts. Concepts such as biotic factors and abiotic factors were frequently not used. It is important to ensure that preservice teachers have a solid understanding of ecological concepts before they begin teaching. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Guided Field Observations: Variables Related to Preservice Teachers' Knowledge about Effective Primary Reading Instruction
AN  - 205363535
AB  - Relations between preservice teachers' guided field observations of primary literacy instruction and knowledge about effective beginning reading practices were explored. Preservice teachers (n=48) participated in a Directed Field Experience course including instruction on and observations of exemplary teaching practices promoting student engagement and literacy achievement. Correlations, calculated between the quantity of exemplary reading instruction practices observed by preservice teachers and the accuracy of observations with their knowledge about effective beginning literacy instruction, suggest guided field observations of exemplary practices may positively impact preservice teachers' knowledge of effective early literacy instruction. Observing more exemplary practices was associated with preservice teachers' knowledge acquisition represented in concept maps (r=.368; p=.015). Practices promoting a generally motivating classroom atmosphere were more readily understood by preservice teachers than intricate subtleties of motivating literacy instruction.

T1  - Teaching and Coherent Science: An Investigation of Teachers' Beliefs About and Practice of Teaching Science Coherently
AN  - 195204105
AB  - This article is about an investigation of six middle school science teachers 'beliefs and instructional practice about the coherence of the science they teach as articulated by National Science Education Standards (NRC, 1996). Many well intentioned reform efforts focus on improving content knowledge of teachers, but many classroom teachers regularly miss opportunities to provide conceptual connections within the science ideas building the sense of coherence in science. This investigation involved a quasi experimental study to examine the efficacy of a method for collecting data about middle school science teachers 'thinking about science and to determine if they teach science coherently. The teachers were surveyed, interviewed, provided concept maps about their thinking of the science they taught, and observed to investigate whether their practice reflects their beliefs. An examination of the teachers 'beliefs, stated and unstated curriculum, the connections among topics and the nature of science revealed that one, the observation tool many have merit for identifying the content and connections among science topics, and two, that teachers 'stated beliefs consistent with the National Science Education Standards 'vision for coherent science, did not match their demonstrated practice. The content taught could be characterized in three ways: coherent content and few connections, coherent content and connections, and not coherent content. This indicates for this group of middle school science teachers that knowing how they think about science and how those beliefs are reflected in their teaching is complex. This study can inform teacher education and professional development efforts about the need to move beyond just content enhancement to examine prior beliefs about the connections of concepts within science.

T1  - Improving reading in a middle school science classroom
AN  - 216922553
AB  - Another major concern among middle school educators is low scores for most students coupled with the lack of a notable increase in students' overall achievement scores on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP; National Center for Education Statistics, 2006), a long-term trend in reading assessment.  The effectiveness of reading strategy instruction A substantial body of research documents the effectiveness of strategic reading instruction for middle school students on their comprehension of text (Trabasso & Bouchard, 2002).  Specifically, PLAN begins with an assessment of the reading task demand, such as taking a chapter test or writing a paper.With the task for reading in mind, students predict (P) the content of the text and construct a tentative concept map; locate (L) on the map what is known by placing checkmarks and what is not known by placing question marks; add (A) links to the map during the reading of the textbook to confirm checkmarks and to address the question marks; and note (N) a reformulated understanding by revising the map, writing a summary, or performing any other task that might be aligned with the purposes for reading (see Table 1).

T1  - Conceptual change in pre -service science teachers' views on nature of science when learning a unit on the physics of waves
AN  - 89137339
AB  - Recent reform efforts in science education have culminated in National Science Education Standards (NSES), which include the nature of science and science inquiry themes across all grade levels. Consideration must be given to pre-service science teachers’ nature of science conceptions and their perceived roles in implementing the nature of science in the science classroom. This qualitative study investigates how pre-service science teachers’ views about the nature of science develop and change when learning a college physics unit on waves in an urban university.    The study uses case study methodology with four pre-service science teachers as individual units of analysis. Data regarding the participants’ views about the nature of science were collected before and after the instruction on the physics of waves unit. The research design used ‘The Views of Nature of Science/Views of Scientific Inquiry-Physics Questionnaire’ followed by structured interviews throughout the wave unit. In addition, the participants responded to daily questions that incorporated nature of science themes and constructed concept maps regarding the physics content and their nature of science understanding.    After completing the VNOS/VOSI-PHYS questionnaire the pre-service science teachers’ views of the nature of science were found to be mainly naïve and transitional before the instruction. At the end of the wave unit instruction, the data indicated that conceptual change occurred in participants’ nature of science views, shifting toward informed views. The findings of this study provide evidence that using explicit instruction with specific activities, such as experiments and concept mapping, shifted the pre-service science teachers’ views away from naïve and toward informed.

T1  - Assessing mind maps as an aide to career planning
AN  - 304837931
AB  - Attracting, developing, and retaining key employees are critical business imperatives today. Many segments of business already face a potentially serious shortage of workers with critical skills, and this problem is expected to become more acute in the coming decades (Conway, 2007; Powers, 2007). This skills shortage could jeopardize the survival of many businesses unless steps are taken to address this issue (May, 2006). One of the best ways for firms to ensure they will have employees with the necessary technical and business skills in the future is to focus on providing better career development and career planning opportunities for their current employees (Kirton, 2006). While the critical role career development will play in the future success of many firms has been well established, surprisingly little research has been done on specifically what types of tools, techniques, or processes lead to the most effective career development plans. In this research, one potential career planning aid, mind mapping, is examined to determine whether it can be an effective aid to those creating career plans or making career decisions.    To assess the effectiveness of mind mapping as an aid to career planning, a quasi-experiment was conducted with students in a college career development class. All subjects were first given two common commercially available tests designed to measure their career decision making ability. Next the experiment group was given several hours of training in mind mapping and shown how mind mapping techniques could be used to aid in career planning and general decision making. Finally both groups were retested to determine if the experiment group showed significantly greater improvement than the control group. In addition to testing for the effect of mind mapping this study also included the examination of correlations between a number of demographic variables and scores on the two test instruments.

T1  - A comparative study of the effect of collaborative problem -solving in a Massively Multiplayer Online Game (MMOG) on individual achievement
AN  - 304825929
AB  - Since the early 2000s, significant attention has been given to the academic potential of a new type of online game called Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs) that take place in 3-dimensional (3D) immersive persistent worlds. MMOGs are believed to hold significant promise for educators because they provide for the player (learner) rich learning opportunities that exemplify quality-learning experiences but there is little empirical research and published work on MMOGs. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of collaborative problem solving during MMOG play on the individual achievement (posttest and concept-map construction scores) of 159 sixth-grade students. There were four comparison groups of existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=100): two taught by the researcher and two taught by the regular sixth-grade science teacher and an experimental group of two existing, intact sixth-grade classes (n=59) taught by the researcher. During the 8-day investigation, the experimental group played Web Earth Online, an ecology-based MMOG, and the comparison group received traditional instruction that included multimedia-rich, hands-on, collaborative activities to learn about the life cycle and survival needs of the Eastern Bluebird. A content analysis of the log files of player dialog to assess player collaborative teamwork during MMOG play was utilized. A dependent-samples t test and an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilized to examine the differences in performance between the experimental and comparison groups on the content knowledge assessment and concept-map construction task. A correlation of frequencies was utilized to examine the relationship between collaborative teamwork-strategy scores of students in the MMOG group and posttest and concept-map scores. Satisfaction surveys were administered to examine game and unit satisfaction.    Results of the analysis showed that individuals who participated in the experimental group tended to have statistically significant lower  posttest scores than students in the comparison group taught by the researcher (based on the 33-item test results) or in the comparison group taught by the teacher (based on the more reliable 17-item test results). Although no statistically significant differences were found in the scores from the experimental group, a statistically significant difference between pre- and posttest was found for the whole sample. Descriptive statistics indicated that learning growth occurred in both groups as evidenced by the pre-and posttest difference in means.    Moreover, nonsignificant differences among the three groups in terms of concept-map scores were observed. An analysis of the chat log files of the MMOG participants revealed that only 30% of the chats involved collaboration, with the more common strategies being Communication, Leadership, and Interpersonal. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between usage of Leadership strategies and posttest scores. Findings from correlation results show that there is a high degree of interitem correlation between the collaborative strategies identified for the study from the chat log files of the experimental group.    The percentage of responses of agree and strongly agree that participants learned from the MMOG and the instructional unit are 82%, 58%, and 75% for experimental, researcher's comparison, and teacher's comparison, respectively, with the experimental students overwhelmingly indicated they learned about the Eastern Bluebird.    The findings from this study suggested that the educational use of video games, specifically MMOGs, can be a viable pedagogical strategy. Results indicated that Web Earth Online was engaging and motivating for students and that the study indicated that concept maps are appropriate instruments to measure learning in a MMOG. Because of the growth in learning in both groups a claim can be made that the rich learning experiences in the comparison groups provided a situated-learning environment (authentic context, authentic activities, authentic assessment, expert modeling, and situated mentoring) that was very similar to the experiences of students in the experimental groups.

T1  - Using rock art as an alternative science pedagogy
AN  - 304686206
AB  - College-level and seventh-grade science students were studied to understand the power of a field index, the Rock Art Stability Index (RASI), for student learning about complex biophysical environmental processes. In order to determine if the studied population was representative, 584 college and seventh-grade students undertook a concept mapping exercise after they had learned basic weathering science via in-class lecture. Of this large group, a subset of 322 college students and 13 seventh-grade students also learned RASI through a field experience involving the analysis of rock weathering associated with petroglyphs. After learning weathering through RASI, students completed another concept map. This was a college population where roughly 46% had never taken a "lab science" course and nearly 22% were from minority (non-white) populations.    Analysis of student learning through the lens of actor-network theory revealed that when landscape is viewed as process (i.e. many practices), science education embodies both an alternative science philosophy and an alternative materialistic worldview. When RASI components were analyzed after only lecture, student understanding of weathering displayed little connection between weathering form and weathering process. After using RASI in the field however, nearly all students made illustrative concept maps rich in connections between weathering form and weathering process for all subcomponents of RASI.    When taken as an aggregate, and measured by an average concept map score, learning increased by almost 14%, Among college minority students, the average score increase approached 23%. Among female students, the average score increase was 16%. For seventh-grade students, scores increased by nearly 36%. After testing for normalcy with Kolmogorov-Smirnov, t-tests reveal that all of these increases were highly statistically significant at p<0.001. The growth in learning weathering science by minority students, as compared to non-minority students, was also statistically significant at p<0.01. These findings reveal the power of field work through RASI to strengthen cognitive linkages between complex biophysical processes and the corresponding rock weathering forms.

T1  - Integrating holistic nursing at the University of Delaware
AN  - 304634862
AB  - There is growing concern whether health care providers are adequately prepared to address the safety and needs of clients related to complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Nursing faculty have limited knowledge to teach CAM content. Student nurses must be adequately prepared to pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX). This project constructs a conceptual framework for integrating holistic nursing and CAM into the curriculum at the University of Delaware. A concept map develops the components of the plan and outlines the steps of the process. The plan is based on a review of the literature, and surveys and interviews of faculty and students to discover best practices.    Chapter One consists of identifying the problem and supporting the argument through a review of the literature. In this chapter the main problems of increased consumer use and the lack of CAM content in the curriculum are discussed. In addition, recommendations from accrediting bodies and professional organizations are provided. The overall plan of the project is presented.    Chapter Two presents the results of the knowledge, attitudes, and practices about CAM of faculty and students. In addition, in-person interviews with faculty about the role of CAM in their courses are discussed.    Chapter Three presents the design of the proposed integration plan. The plan provides a matrix that outlines where holistic CAM content should be integrated into the curriculum. Strategies for successful implementation are discussed. A professional development course plan for faculty about CAM was created. Adult learning principles and use of technology in teaching were investigated. Lastly, an evaluation plan is provided to determine the success of the project. The design of the professional development course was informed from the results of the survey and through a review of the literature.    This project serves as a plan for future integration of holistic nursing in schools of nursing in the State of Delaware. A grant has been obtained to continue this work. Lessons learned and changes required during the integration will serve as important information in the refinement of this process. This conceptual framework will serve as the basis for continued opportunities.

T1  - The context, factors and pathways related to adolescent sexuality in Lima, Peru
AN  - 304618241
AB  - Background. Existing research on adolescent sexuality in Peru has limitations that have led to gaps in knowledge. The objective of this study was to better understand adolescent sexuality by using a mixed method approach to access adolescent perspectives in Pampas de San Juan de Miraflores, a peripheral area of Lima.    Purpose. The qualitative research aims were: (1) to enable adolescents to narrate their lives to date; (2) to enable adolescents to locate sexuality within the broader context of their lives; (3) to identify and describe individual- and societal-level items and clusters of items that adolescents perceive to be related to adolescent sexuality, and to explore the importance of the items for sexuality-related outcomes; and (4) to understand the adolescent-chosen pathways from the clusters to having sex.    The quantitative research aims were: (1) to analyze the factor structure and internal consistency reliability of seven scales; and (2) to examine the association between the scales and precoital behaviors and vaginal sex.    Methods. First, life history interviews were conducted with twenty purposively-selected 12–17 year old females and males. Next, concept mapping sessions were carried out with 63 randomly-selected 15–17 year olds. Participants brainstormed items related to adolescent sexuality, sorted these items into clusters and rated each item on its importance to sexuality-related outcomes, and created a pathway from the clusters of items to having sex. Finally, a survey was carried out with 300 randomly-selected 15–17 year olds to validate the concept mapping results.    Results. The life history interviews detailed the complex lives of adolescents, including personal responsibilities, family problems, emotional and social pressures, economic struggles, racism and violence. Although sexuality is present in adolescents' lives, many narrators view the complete expression of their sexuality as a constrained choice.    Concept mapping provided important new factors, and new perspectives on previously-recognized factors, that influence adolescent sexuality. Individual-level items include self-respect, honesty and responsibility, personal will and individual thoughts and other items include family dynamics, connectedness with peers, teachers and the community, and partner relationships. The pathways to having sex include the causes and consequences of having sex, the close environment and partners.    The quantitative component produced seven new scales for measuring factors associated with adolescent sexuality: self-image, achievements for the future, family education, peer relationships, teacher connectedness, individual thoughts, and partner relationships. All of the scales have high internal reliability and many were positively associated with vaginal sex or precoital behaviors.    Conclusions. This thesis provided a comprehensive understanding of adolescent sexuality in Lima, Peru. The qualitative methodologies offered an in-depth view of adolescent perspectives on the context, factors and pathways driving sexuality. The quantitative component validated the qualitative results and tested the association between psychosocial measures and sexual behaviors. These findings represent important insights for future research, programs and policies for adolescents in Peru.

T1  - The walk of life: Stress in the lives of school superintendents in Central Illinois
AN  - 304606363
AB  - The purpose of this study and research was to provide a descriptive and holistic study of stressors in the superintendency and find out how practicing superintendents respond to and manage stress.   The research in this qualitative research study was presented in narrative form. This methodology is founded on the evidence that individuals make sense of their lives and world according to the stories that they have developed to illustrate it. The use of stories or narratives allows the reader to contemplate their own personal experiences and to learn about others within our world. Stories also mark historical events, add to the culture of the area being studied and to our understanding. The stories were based upon extensive interviews and used as case studies toward data analysis. Qualitative research tools of concept mapping, decoding, distinctions of the participants and cross member checking were done within this study. Theory triangulation of the data was used along with the narratives as case studies to interpret and analyze toward a single set of data.   Major questions involved in this study of stress and the superintendency were: What were the perceived stressors of the participants in the study? How were the participants affected by stress? What were the participating superintendents doing to cope with stress.   The evolution and context of this dissertation and its research were portrayed through the stories or narratives section. The stories illustrated the objectives of the research, exemplified the selection of the participating members, and engraved the responses and feelings of the participating school superintendents of small, medium and large school districts. Also, the stories depicted the perceived stressors and coping techniques used by the participants in this research study. Their life stories represent highlights and case studies that then yielded an interpretive ethnographical portrayal of the stress in the lives of the superintendency. The narratives or stories became case studies and exhibited and identified some of the main stressors they face in their jobs and lives, the effects, and their ways of coping with stress both positively and negatively.   The perceived stressors, affects of stress, and what the practicing superintendents did to cope were brought out in this study. The study could be utilized to more effectively understand and cope with stress.

T1  - Scientific concept development in the English Language Arts classroom
AN  - 304496274
AB  - This study uses discourse analysis to examine how scientific concepts (Vygotsky, 1997) develop in an English Language Arts class over the course of one curricular unit. The study focuses on how two students in one 12 th grade English Language Arts classroom develop towards the scientific concept of summary. The study examines the teacher’s classroom discussion of the concept of summary, and the students’ development of the concept of summary. The development is investigated using Systemic Functional Linguistics to analyze the classroom and interview talk from both teacher and students. The use of concept mapping and SFL analysis (Halliday, 1994) focus on transitivity, interpersonal metaphor, and clause linking devices to enhance, elaborate, or expand the concept’s web of relations. Understanding the initial developmental level of the concept helped to examine how the teacher’s discourse surrounding the concept mediated the concept of summary. Language and schooling as a part of the teaching and learning context and pedagogical issues are discussed.

T1  - Work-based self -esteem: Conceptual, theoretical, and scale development and model testing
AN  - 304475286
AB  - My dissertation explores and proposes measures for distinct and differentiated elements of individuals' self-esteem at work. Conceptual and theoretical development revealed that work-based self-esteem contains multiple elements, each of which has different antecedents and outcomes. Concept mapping, which captures the phenomenological aspects of work based self esteem as actually experienced by workers, confirmed this argument. I found that work-based self-esteem is derived from workers' view of themselves based on their (1) performance, (2) work roles, (3) social interactions at work, (4) the organization itself, and (5) occupation. Using survey data from workers, I developed measures for each of these elements using standard construct development protocols. Using an independent sample of workers and their peers and supervisors, the hypotheses were confirmed that these elements have different correlates (such as extra-role behaviors) in the nomological network developed in my conceptual and theoretical arguments. My dissertation provides a platform for further theoretical and empirical work on work-based self-esteem and intrinsic motivation.

T1  - The evolving practitioner: A qualitative inquiry into reflections on teacher perspectives in a professional development program in higher education
AN  - 304349881
AB  - Teachers' perspectives on teaching and learning in higher education have been identified as a critical area of research. This qualitative study was designed to answer the following question: How does reflecting on teaching and learning within a two year period in a professional development program (the Master Teacher Program, or MTP) contribute (or not) to teachers' changing perspectives on teaching and learning? I interviewed six Quebec CEGEP (college) teachers on five different occasions, as they completed the first four courses in the MTP. The participants were female, taught in different disciplines, programs, and colleges, and had various years of teaching experience. Repeated, semi-structured interviews were analyzed, using the dual processes of categorizing and connecting (Maxwell & Miller, in press). Results converged to reveal four patterns and three major dimensions. Through categorizing, four patterns emerged that described a process of movement from teacher to learner-centeredness. I used the four metaphors of awakening, stretching, exercising, and shaping to represent these four patterns. Furthermore, I corroborated these findings by examining participants' concept maps and their reflective journals. I found additional evidence for the four patterns in the narrative summaries that I constructed, using connecting strategies. These narratives also exposed some of the more contextualized aspects of the evolution in teacher perspectives. In addition to the four patterns, three major dimensions related to teacher perspectives emerged. The participants reported that they had become more aware of the learner and the learning process, more intentional in curriculum planning and teaching, and they increased in self-knowledge, and in particular, in their sense of identity as teacher professionals. Reflection on practice functioned as a major factor underlying changes in perspectives. Time was also a significant factor. Findings showed that it took at least one year for most of the participants to link theory with practice, before they reported implementing changes in pedagogy. Therefore, changes in perspectives preceded changes in practice. The results of this study suggest that professional development programs, such as the MTP, can help teachers evolve as effective practitioners. Moreover, such programs can also help to foster a sense of professional identity among teachers in higher education. Future research can further clarify relationships among perspectives, teaching experience, and disciplinary background, and continue to explore incentives for teachers in higher education to participate in professional development.

T1  - Weight bias in pediatric healthcare providers: An exploratory study using photo elicitation with focus groups
AN  - 304341650
AB  - The prevalence of overweight and obese children is increasing, posing a challenge for pediatric healthcare providers designing care for this population. Overweight and obese children and adolescents experience many of the same physical and psychosocial problems as overweight adults, including weight bias. Little is known about weight bias toward children among pediatric healthcare providers.    To explore weight bias toward children among pediatric healthcare providers when assessing and planning care, two aims were addressed: (a) to describe the attitudes and beliefs of pediatric healthcare providers toward children depicted as normal weight or obese; and (b) to describe the ways healthcare providers demonstrate weight bias when planning health care for children depicted as normal weight or obese.    Using a qualitative descriptive design with photo elicitation, audio-recorded focus-group interviews were held with 27 pediatric healthcare providers (nurse practitioners and physicians). Provider responses to sketches of normal weight and overweight twelve-year-old male and female children were elicited. Sketches were accompanied by standardized scenarios indicating a well child sports physical exam. Five focus groups were held in several offices of a large northwestern health-maintenance organization. Transcribed data were analyzed using ATLAS-ti to identify codes and categories in the data.    Two themes were identified: (a) Pediatric healthcare providers emphasized weight-related concerns in their assessment and care of overweight female patients and de-emphasized weight in their consideration of overweight male care planning; and (b) In articulating plans of care for 12-year old children, providers develop more complex plans of care for overweight children that diminish the emphasis on typical, age-appropriate risk assessment and counseling in favor of weight-related assessments and interventions. Categorical and concept map analysis demonstrated that sexuality was discussed within the normal-weight but not the overweight scenarios. Eating disorders was discussed within normal-weight female exams while beliefs  that height catches up to weight were observed with overweight male scenarios, implying overweight males may outgrow obesity. Barriers to change such as family eating patterns, living in an unsafe neighborhood and parental attitudes were identified in the overweight male and female scenarios. Knowledge discovered can inform pediatric practice, education and nursing research.

T1  - Impact of an integrated science and reading intervention (INSCIREAD) on bilingual students' misconceptions, reading comprehension, and transferability of strategies
AN  - 304325401
AB  - This thesis describes a research study that resulted in an instructional model directed at helping fourth grade diverse students improve their science knowledge, their reading comprehension, their awareness of the relationship between science and reading, and their ability to transfer strategies. The focus of the instructional model emerged from the intersection of constructs in science and reading literacy; the model identifies cognitive strategies that can be used in science and reading, and inquiry-based instruction related to the science content read by participants. The intervention is termed  INSCIREAD (Instruction in Science and Reading). The GoInquire  web-based system (2006) was used to develop students’ content knowledge in slow landform change.   Seventy-eight students participated in the study. The treatment group comprised 49 students without disabilities and 8 students with disabilities. The control group comprised 21 students without disabilities. The design of the study is a combination of a mixed-methods quasi-experimental design (Study 1), and a single subject design with groups as the unit of analysis (Study 2).   The results from the quantitative measures demonstrated that the text recall data analysis from Study 1 yielded near significant statistical levels when comparing the performance of students without disabilities in the treatment group to that of the control group. Visual analyses of the results from the text recall data from Study 2 showed at least minimal change in all groups.    The results of the data analysis of the level of the generated questions show there was a statistically significant increase in the scores students without disabilities obtained in the questions they generated from the pre to the posttest. The analyses conducted to detect incongruities, to summarize and rate importance, and to determine the number of propositions on a science and reading concept map data showed a statistically significant difference between students without disabilities in the treatment and the control groups on post-intervention scores.   The analysis of the data from the number of misconceptions of students without disabilities showed that the frequency of 4 of the 11 misconceptions changed significantly from pre to post elicitation stages. The analyses of the qualitative measures of the think alouds and interviews generally supported the above findings.

T1  - The effect of an STC orientation to teaching on student academic performance and motivation in secondary earth science
AN  - 288097999
AB  - Student achievement gaps among subgroups remain a prevalent and critical issue in urban education systems. In many classes these students remain the target—and often the victims—of test-driven curriculum. Missing from their urban education is one of the most important aspects of a true education: a sense of place within that education. Science educators and educational researchers might consider the benefits of Sociotransformative Constructivism (STC) as a means of creating a more meaningful education for urban youth. This study examined the impact of an STC teaching orientation on student motivation and academic performance in secondary earth science students. The mixed methodology employed used both qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection consisted of STC activities, survey data, classroom observations, studentgenerated work and threaded discussions. Statistical analysis included independent t-tests of pre- and post-instruction concept maps. The results showed that the adaptation of an STC teaching orientation has a positive impact on student motivation and performance in secondary earth science.

T1  - The Effect of Using Concept Maps as Study Tools on Achievement in Chemistry
AN  - 2786500463
AB  - The purposes of this study were to: (1) examine whether or not the construction of concept maps by students improves their achievement and ability to solve higher order questions in chemistry, (2) investigate the differential effect of the treatment by gender and achievement level, and (3) explore the relationships between performance on concept maps and chemistry achievement. Participants were 60 tenth-grade students randomly divided into two groups. The study spanned six weeks in a class that met five times a week. The material covered was acid-base titration and equilibrium in weak acids. The students were pre- and post-tested using a teacher-constructed chemistry test. Results showed that while there were no significant differences on the achievement total score, there were significant differences favoring the experimental group for scores on the knowledge level questions. Moreover, there were sex-achievement interactions at the knowledge and comprehension level questions favoring females and achievement level – achievement interactions favoring low achievers. Finally, there were significant correlations between students’ scores on high level questions and the convergence and total concept map scores.

T1  - Generating conceptually personalized interactions for educational digital libraries using concept maps
AN  - 275963788
AB  - Personalized or one-to-one instruction holds great potential for improving the state of education. But due to lack of good teachers this goal can only be approximated with the help of new and innovative computational technology. The research reported in this dissertation attempts to improve the state of education by aiming to support personalized student interaction with online learning environments in formal and informal educational settings by developing methods and techniques that are scalable, domain neutral, and can be used with open ended student inquiries. In particular this research focuses on conceptual personalization of interaction within online learning environments based on student and domain concept maps which are used as the semi-formal knowledge representation scheme. To address the conceptual personalization agenda three activities were carried out during the course of this research: (1) Assessment study, (2) Algorithm design implementation, and (3) Adaptive learning environments prototyping. In the assessment study, cognitive process of human experts were analyzed to understand operations used by human when assessing student understanding by comparing a student concept map to the domain concept map. The synthesized operations were then used to guide the development of algorithms that can automatically assess student conceptual understanding from their concept map. Lastly, the results from the automatic student assessment were embedded into task specific adaptive learning environments.

T1  - An evaluation of meaningful learning in a high school chemistry course
AN  - 275547758
AB  - This study utilized an action research methodology to examine students' understandings of science knowledge, and meaningful learning using the SLD (Science Lecture Demonstration) and laboratory instructional method in a high school chemistry classroom. This method was a modification of the Science Lecture Demonstration Method as developed by Majerich and Schmuckler (2004, in press), the modification due to the addition of a laboratory component. The participants in this study represented a convenience sample which included one class of twenty-two, middle to high socio-economic status students (Mean family income over $75,000/year in 2005 U.S. dollars) in an honors chemistry course at a public high school in the state of New Jersey. These participants included nine girls and thirteen boys.   The results of this study indicated what the students' understandings of science knowledge were, how the understandings differed among students, and to what extent those understandings were indicative of meaningful learning. These results were obtained by careful analysis of student generated concept maps, narratives from demonstration quizzes, laboratory reports, and test questions, as well as a teacher/researcher reflection upon the classroom experience. A simple taxonomy for analyzing students' understandings of science knowledge was developed, based upon the work of Majerich (2004). Findings indicated that the students' understanding of science knowledge, as well as the extent of meaningful learning that occurs in the chemistry classroom may be influenced by the roles of: explicit directions, pre-existing knowledge from elementary and middle school science classes, using examples vs. non-examples, macroscopic vs. microscopic views of nature, time for reflection, and everyday vs. scientific language. Results obtained from high school student responses confirmed Novak's observation of elementary students' lack of differentiation between the terms vapor and gas (Novak, 1998).

T1  - Should Be Concept Mapping Used In The Science Teaching?
AN  - 2343819250
AB  - Students´ understanding of physics develops through everyday experience. Teachers must help students overcome their prior naive notions and move toward a more scientific understanding. This process is fundamental to student learning and it is one of very important objectives of physics teaching. In this article the strategy of concept mapping which can help students rationalize their perceptions in light of accepted scientific understanding is described. Concept maps are drawings or diagrams showing the mental connections that students make between a major concept and other concepts they have learned. This technique provides an observable and assessable record of the students´ conceptual schemata – the patterns of associations they make in relation to a given focal concept. Concept maps allow the teacher to discover the web of relationships that learners bring to the task at hand – the students´ starting points.

T1  - Learning Partnerships - The Art of Handling Ambiguity
AN  - 1415221007
AB  - This intrinsic case study is about people who worked in partnerships. Each of the partnerships emerged from relationships formed between the business, education, government and community sectors. A principle aim of the cross-sector partnerships was to enhance learning opportunities, integral to which was the incorporation of ICT. The study explores through interweaving narratives, some of the key interrelationships that emerged from the evolving partnerships as they strived to accomplish their aims.The partnerships represented a rich and complex context for dynamic and strategic change occurring, not only in the evolving partnerships, but also in the systems they intended to consolidate and optimise. Furthermore, such complexity pervaded ideological notions of instability and discontinuity arising from difference that may be implicit or explicit in open, distributed complex systems.The metaphor of hypertext serves to both retain textural qualities of organisation and address key problematics associated with visualisation and representation and also as a means to reflect upon the study by encouraging improvisatory processes akin to those experienced by the participants. In this respect, hypertext is not used to simply challenge artificial boundaries, linearities and determinisms but rather, prompt the construction of meanings further to those partially represented. It also serves to maintain a clearer relationship between those contexts within which research has been, or becomes situated.The thesis largely rests on its representational form in terms of its self-sufficiency to portray, convey, express, evoke, engage and inform. Ambiguity forms a fundamental facet of the thesis. In addition to those that rest within the texts, graphic illustrations are used to provide narratives in different forms whereby, readers are not bound by the same inadequacies or constraints in drawing meaning about the subject from text alone. By taking the view of the artist, the illustrations provide a flexibility that overcomes some of the dimensional limitations of the thesis and further emphasises its connectionist, constructivist and aesthetic undertones. The links between components and nuanced meanings emphasises the interdependencies in terms that transcend the representational form of discursive language. The case is thus, synthesised in the following illustration:

T1  - Concept mapping and pupils' learning in primary science in Singapore
AN  - 1955988088
AB  - This paper reports on a quasi-experimental study which examined the effectiveness of concept mapping as a revision tool in enhancing pupils' examination performances in primary science. The research objective seeks to determine whether there are significant differences in achievement between the concept mapping and traditional method of revision groups after treatment in both primary gifted and mainstream classes. This research hopes to establish the relationship between pupils' understanding of science concepts along with performance and use of concept mapping as a revision tool in primary science. Findings of this study will be useful towards the implementation of concept mapping as an instructional and revision tool in the primary science classroom.

T1  - Concept Maps for General Chemistry
AN  - 212022949
AB  - Earl develops two diagrams that summarize the connections of the subject matter as usually presented in the first semester of a general chemistry course. The diagrams organize the course material into two overall "themes": a structure and properties theme and a quantitative chemical relationships theme. These are similar in intent and design to published concept maps based on Joseph D. Novak's ideas, although they are less elaborate for he have not labeled the connections.

T1  - Using Computers to Individually-generate vs. Collaboratively-generate Concept Maps
AN  - 1287042961
AB  - Five eighth grade science classes of students in at a middle school were assigned to three treatment groups: those who individually concept mapped, those who collaboratively concept mapped, and those who independently used their study time. The findings revealed that individually generating concept maps on computers during study time positively influenced science concept learning above and beyond independent use of study time, but that collaboratively generating concept maps did not. Students in both individual and collaborative concept mapping groups had positive attitudes toward concept mapping using Inspiration software. However, students in the collaborative concept mapping group did not like working in a group. This study contributes to the limited body of knowledge concerning the comparative effectiveness of individually and collaboratively-generating concept maps on computers for learning.

T1  - Physics faculty beliefs and values about the teaching and learning of problem solving. II. Procedures for measurement and analysis
AN  - 2550495646
AB  - To identify and describe the basis upon which instructors make curricular and pedagogical decisions, we have developed an artifact-based interview and an analysis technique based on multilayered concept maps. The policy capturing technique used in the interview asks instructors to make judgments about concrete instructional artifacts similar to those they likely encounter in their teaching environment. The analysis procedure alternatively employs both an a priori systems view analysis and an emergent categorization to construct a multilayered concept map, which is a hierarchically arranged set of concept maps where child maps include more details than parent maps. Although our goal was to develop a model of physics faculty beliefs about the teaching and learning of problem solving in the context of an introductory calculus-based physics course, the techniques described here are applicable to a variety of situations in which instructors make decisions that influence teaching and learning.

T1  - Use of the Pathfinder Scaling Algorithm to Measure Students' Structural Knowledge of Community Health Nursing
AN  - 203934069; 17711068
AB  - Findings from cognitive science research suggest that organization of stored knowledge may be of greater importance than amount of knowledge in supporting better comprehension and problem solving (Day et al., 2001).  Because structural knowledge is identified as an indicator of increasing expertise and can be developed and refined though instruction (McGaghie, McCrimmon, Mitchell, Thompson, & Ravitch, 2000), it may be a valuable outcome for course instructors to measure.  Currently, Pathfinder's strength in classroom evaluation appears to be as an efficient, quantifiable measure of an instructionally relevant kind of knowledge that underlies cognitive skill development.  [...]at this time, instructors may find students' PFNets to be most suitable in formative evaluation, as a means to diagnose progress toward the development of integrated structural knowledge.

T1  - Using Insights From Non Engineers To Improve Introduction To Engineering Via Functional Analysis
AN  - 2317757074
AB  - This work describes an effort to identify and utilize insights from non-engineering students in technological literacy courses to identify themes that may enliven introduction to engineering courses. Beginning engineering students may have interests more closely aligned with their non-engineer peers than current engineering professionals. Technological literacy courses on a number of campuses have established that explaining technology from a “how things work,” perspective captivates the interest of a broad range of students. This “how things work” approach is characterized by a focus on technology familiar to the students in their everyday life, use of visual and graphical explanations such as concept maps, and inclusion of information that helps to establish a sense of empowerment upon understanding the technology. Incorporating this “how things work” approach into introduction to engineering will help achieve engineers that exhibit “practical ingenuity,” and an ability to communicate technical issues to non-engineers, two critical attributes of the Engineer of 2020 as identified by the National Academy of Engineering. This work suggests that the visual and concept map approach is analogous to the engineering design technique of functional analysis or functional decomposition. Functional analysis provides a mechanism to discuss how things work with engineering students that is rooted in established engineering design methodology. Additionally, important devices or components in familiar technology can be treated as sub-functions in the functional analysis context. As these sub-functions consistently reappear throughout products or processes developed by the various engineering disciplines, authentic engineering knowledge can be introduced to introductory engineering students. Initial implementation of this approach in an Introduction to Engineering course at Hope College is outlined.
Engineering departments have long sustained a one-way relationship with their campus communities. Engineering students, as part of their broad education, take classes offered by various departments across campus. However, it had been uncommon for anyone but a fully committed engineering major to appear in engineering classes. Few engineering departments offered service courses for non-engineers.
Notable exceptions existed to this rule, and recent developments have fostered a more reciprocal relationship between some engineering programs and liberal arts departments. In 1996 the National Science Foundation’s Shaping The Future: New Expectations for Undergraduate Education in Science, Mathematics, Engineering, and Technology called for greater attention for the 80 percent of college students who are not planning on careers in science, engineering, mathematics, or technology1. In 2002, the National

T1  - Concept Mapping as a Means of Course Evaluation
AN  - 203935497; 17547347
AB  - According to Mintzes, Wandersee, and Novak (2000), concept mapping is a powerful tool to assist in course evaluation.  Use of Concept Maps At the beginning of the course before any lectures were given, each student (N = 45) created a concept map showing what they already knew about wellness, using the wellness parameters indicated in the lecture schedule provided in the course syllabus (i.e., physical, emotional, psychological, spiritual, and intellectual).

T1  - Learning Style Preference and Student Aptitude for Concept Maps
AN  - 203928364; 17547346
AB  - [...]the need to ensure safe and effective entry-level practice of nurses drove the need for novice practitioners to demonstrate a higher level of knowledge (NCSBN, 2003).  Teachers of college-level science courses have engaged this strategy as well (Gahr, 2003; Wilkes, Cooper, Lewin, & Batts, 1999).  Because of the value of concept mapping in practice disciplines, both medical (West, Pomeroy, Park, Gerstenberger, & Sandoval, 2000) and nursing education have adopted concept mapping as a way to facilitate the understanding of theory and the internalization of concepts, challenging the traditional methods of rote memorization and passive learning.

T1  - Tools for Knowledge Analysis, Synthesis, and Sharing
AN  - 2259588322
AB  - Change and complexity are creating a need for increasing levels of literacy in science and technology. Presently, we are beginning to provide students with clear contexts in which to learn, including clearly written text, visual displays and maps, and more effective instruction. We are also beginning to give students tools that promote their own literacy by helping them to interact with the learning context. These tools include peer-group skills as well as strategies to analyze text and to indicate comprehension by way of text summaries and concept maps. Even with these tools, more appears to be needed. Disparate backgrounds and languages interfere with the comprehension and the sharing of knowledge. To meet this need, two new tools are proposed. The first tool fractures language ontologically, giving all learners who use it a language to talk about what has, and what has not, been uttered in text or talk about the world. The second fractures language epistemologically, giving those involved in working with text or on the world around them a way to talk about what they have done and what remains to be done. Together, these tools operate as a two- tiered knowledge representation of knowledge. This representation promotes both an individual meta-cognitive and a social meta-cognitive approach to what is known and to what is not known, both ontologically and epistemologically. Two hypotheses guide the presentation: If the tools are taught during early childhood, children will be prepared to master science and technology content. If the tools are used by both students and those who design and deliver instruction, the learning of such content will be accelerated.

T1  - Constructing a Graphic Organizer in the Classroom: Introductory Students' Perception of Achievement Using a Decision Map To Solve Aqueous Acid-Base Equilibria Problems
AN  - 211954214
AB  - Common examples of graphic organizers include flow diagrams, concept maps, and decision trees. A novel type of graphic organizer called a decision map is presented. A decision map is a directional heuristic that helps learners solve problems within a generic framework. It incorporates questions that the user must answer and contains conceptual as well as methodological knowledge. The decision map that is presented was created to solve pH problems of varying difficulty that introductory college chemistry students encounter when studying acid-base equilibria.

T1  - The urban environment and physical activity: Factors impacting adolescents' use of recreational facilities
AN  - 304857814
AB  - Aims. The aims of this research are (1) to qualitatively investigate environmental factors influencing both physical activity and recreational facility use for physical activity and (2) to identify and test the statistical significance of associations between park use and objective and perceived measures of the environment.    Methods. Data were collected from students at two predominately African American magnet high schools in Baltimore, Maryland. Multiple qualitative methods were used to address the first aim. First, concept mapping was conducted with 50 adolescents to elicit and rate the importance of environmental factors influencing physical activity. Next, 48 in-depth interviews and 26 direct observations were conducted to explore factors influencing the use of parks and recreation centers for physical activity. To address the second aim, survey data collected from 329 adolescents and Geographical Information Systems data assessing neighborhood park availability and crime were analyzed. Logistic regression models were used to test associations between park use and objective and perceived environmental characteristics.    Results. Adolescents identified seven domains that they perceive of as influencing their physical activity. The relative importance of these domains varied by gender. Young women rated negative social influences, such as crime and violence, as most important to physical activity while young men rated social support and physical activity settings as most important. Adolescents reported several factors that impact facility use, including the presence of adolescent-oriented facilities, maintenance, proximity to home, and cost. The social environment is a key factor, as adolescents prefer safe facilities where they find other active adolescents. The quantitative analysis revealed that objective environmental measures, including park availability and neighborhood crime, were not associated with park use. Several self-reported measures, including increased park availability, park quality, and park use by peers and family, were positively associated with park use. Perceived neighborhood crime, however, was not associated with park use.    Conclusions. This research underscores the relevance of program and policy efforts that aim to promote physical activity through modifications to the environment. Moreover, it highlights the need to develop multi-level intervention approaches that address characteristics of the social and physical environments as well as adolescents' perceptions of the environment.

T1  - The use of interactive instructional strategies on academic performance in nurse education programs
AN  - 304848314
AB  - It is widely recognized that there is a severe shortage of qualified health-care workers in the United States (Kinard, 2004). In the nursing profession specifically, registered nurses are in high demand but short supply. As a result, collegiate programs have found themselves recruiting new students from a much broader base population than before (Campbell & Davis, 1990). Nursing programs therefore risk accepting individuals who may have difficulty meeting the academic demands of required courses in the nursing major.   Although addressing students' academic weaknesses is a challenge, it is important for nurse educators to find strategies that will enable students to be successful and to remain in their nursing programs (Beckes, 1980; Group, 1984; Hodges, 1988; Reed & Hudepohl 1983). In this study the researcher argues that a major factor to be considered in achieving this goal is the use by nurse education faculty of interactive instructional strategies. These strategies may be defined as those in which the instructor engages in dialogue with students or students themselves interact with each other.   This study was designed to answer the following research questions: (1) Do nurse educators in high, medium and low NCLEX (National Council Licensure Examination) performing schools report differences in the interaction they promote in their use of four instructional strategies? (2) Are there differences in the incidence of use of each of the four instructional strategies employed by nurse educators in high, medium and low NCLEX performing schools? (3) What do nurse educators report to be their purpose for using each of the four instructional strategies?   Piaget (1950) and Vygotsky (1978) have provided contemporary educators with a theoretical foundation for the development of teaching methodologies that foster active learning and the meaningful construction of concepts. Vygotsky's work, in particular, has indicated the importance of student to teacher and student to student interaction as new concepts are learned. Consequently methodologies that focus on interaction are an important part of a teacher's repertoire.    Interactive instructional strategies in college math, engineering and psychology have been positively correlated with academic achievement (Duncan& Dick, 2000; Ventimiglia, 1994; Woods, 1996). However, there is little research into the use of interactive instructional strategies in nursing education.    This research study used an ex post facto design. A researcher-designed survey was sent to a sample of nurse educators from purposefully selected state universities and colleges throughout the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States with baccalaureate nursing programs. These institutions were grouped by the researcher into high (89-97 percent), medium (81-88 percent) and low (70-80 percent) NCLEX scoring schools. The survey collected responses that most closely reflect the participants' agreement or disagreement with statements regarding the use of four instructional strategies: lecture, case study, concept mapping and instructional games.   Nurse faculty in high, medium and low NCLEX performing schools did not report differences in the interaction they promote in their teaching. Low NCLEX performing schools did show a statistically significant higher mean in interactivity with regards to concept mapping than high NCLEX performing schools. There were no significant differences in the incidence of use of each interactive methodology employed by nurse educators in high, medium and low NCLEX performing schools. There were also no differences in reported purposes for using different interactive methodologies.

T1  - Using expert knowledge structures to design decision aids
AN  - 304825410
AB  - Auditors use decision aids and audit support systems throughout the course of their work.  Previous research concerning decision aids indicates that the use of such aids can result in the deskilling of the user.  However, other research indicates that a properly designed decision aid can pass along knowledge to the user.  This study demonstrates that a decision aid that is designed using an expert's knowledge structure will result in expertise development by the aid users.  The experimental task involved financial fraud risk assessments made with the assistance of a checklist aid and used student participants.  Two independent variables were employed in this study, decision aid design and outcome feedback.  The manipulation of the decision aid design determined whether the decision aid was organized according to the fraud triangle or according to experts' knowledge structures.  The manipulation of feedback involved the presence or absence of outcome feedback.  Planned comparisons were utilized to test the hypothesis.  According to expectations, a decision aid designed using expert knowledge structures assisted users in developing expert-like knowledge structures and improved performance.  The results suggest that expert knowledge structures could be used in the design of checklist aids in the future.    I found that the organization of the decision aid was a statistically significant determinant of both the knowledge acquisition of the participant and the performance of the participant.  Further, I found that the interaction of decision aid organization and outcome feedback has a statistically significant effect on the performance of the participant.  Supporting my hypotheses, those participants who were in the expertly organized decision aid treatment that were given outcome feedback had knowledge structures that were the closest to the experts and performance that was the closest to the experts.

T1  - A study to determine the essential nurse anesthesia program competencies to be included in clinical performance evaluation tools
AN  - 304820891
AB  - The role of performance evaluations in the educational process of practice disciplines such as social work, psychology, medicine, and nursing in general has been well documented. However, a review of the nurse anesthesia education literature demonstrated a lack of research to develop valid and reliable performance evaluation tools. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to identify the core educational objectives nurse anesthesia program administrators have for their students, reasoning that these should be the basis for a generally accepted clinical performance evaluation tool.   In this study, nurse anesthesia educational program administrators were provided a list of potential clinical objectives and were asked to identify those criteria they believed were essential to evaluate in student performance on a daily basis. Administrators were randomly selected to consider the criteria as it would pertain to either a first or last semester/quarter student. Nearly all of the items were found to be essential with some pertaining more to first semester/quarter students while others pertained more to last semester/quarter students. Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and hierarchical cluster analyses were then utilized in order to develop a graphical representation (i.e., a concept map) of the manner in which participants organized the trainee skills.    Concept mapping provided a visual representation of the evaluation items and demonstrated how the items coordinate with Bloom's educational domains. Similarities were noted in the overall construction and dimensionality of the two concept mappings. Dimension 1 for the graphs appeared to capture the cognitive domain while Dimension 2 appeared to capture a psychomotor versus an affective domain. Although some statistical differences were noted between the two groups of responses and the clustered items were different, it appears that the overall perceptions of the essential items were similar because dimensional interpretation was the same.   The use of consistent, standardized feedback is an essential component of any ongoing evaluation process. The results of this study may be used as a starting place for the development of a standardized clinical performance evaluation form using those behaviors identified as being essential to the evaluation process.

AN  - 304804069
AB  - In an effort to prepare nursing students to deliver safe quality care, critical thinking becomes essential to nursing education. Nurse educators are continually looking for methods that will enhance or improve critical thinking skills. One method that educators have used is concept mapping. Concept mapping allows students to organize their thoughts and see relationships between concepts and plan nursing care accordingly.   The intent of this study was to examine the relationship between concept mapping and critical thinking in first year nursing students. The study employed a quantitative and qualitative design. The quantitative was a pre and post test quasi-experimental design with a non-randomized control group and intervention group. The qualitative design utilized a phenomenological approach to examine the participants lived experience. A pre and post test was custom designed by HESI based on the participants' current curriculum. Demographic data (n=11) was collected on GPA, number of credit hours, age and gender.   The pretest mean scores were not significant between the two groups (p=.825). ANCOVA revealed that there was no variable (GPA, age, gender or number of credit hours) that had significant impact on pretest scores (p=.884). A paired t-test revealed that both groups had a significant increase in post test scores (control group p=.028, experiment group p=.006). An independent t-test revealed that the experimental group mean change score was significantly higher than the control group (p=.018). ANCOVA was then utilized to examine if the mean change scores were significant while adjusting for the other covariates and taking into consideration the small sample size (n=11). The results revealed that the concept mapping group had a significantly greater improvement on their post test scores when compared to the control group scores while controlling for other covariates (p=.022).   The qualitative analysis revealed that concept mapping provided the participants with direction on how to prepare for clinical assignments. As the participants developed their concept maps it became their model for thinking. As the participants created their model they developed a sense of ownership and empowerment of the knowledge. The participants further described that concept mapping required a higher level of thinking. Participants described that concept mapping helped them to critically think as it required them to research and investigate relationships.

T1  - A concept mapping study of the impact of mobilization and deployment on United States Army reservists
AN  - 304777839
AB  - This exploratory study utilized an innovative methodology, concept mapping, to examine the impact of mobilization and deployment on Army Reservists during  Operation Iraqi Freedom. Free-response methodology identified 103 items generated by soldiers who had been deployed from the 98th Division. Five individual interviews with post-deployed soldiers were also conducted to validate the content of the free-responses. Multidimensional scaling and hierarchical cluster analyses were used to identify the underlying structure of the impact of mobilization and deployment. Six specific deployment impact clusters were identified: (1) Family, (2)  Life Altering Experience/Readjustment, (3) My Personal Connection to the War in Iraq, (4) Pride and Patriotism , (5) Coping and Self-Awareness, and (6)  Disillusionment. The clusters My Personal Connection to the War in Iraq and Pride and Patriotism were rated as having the most impact for the mobilized and deployed soldiers. Pattern matching analysis was also conducted to examine the degree of impact of the deployment impact items relationship to Reservist characteristics including gender, age, length of deployment, marital status and rank. With the exception of marital status, there were only minor differences among the intensity of the ratings. Soldier's quality of life was also assessed through use Veteran's Rand 36-Item Health Survey. The VR-36 Mental Component Summary score for enlisted soldiers was found to be significantly lower than the MCS mean for the officers. This exploratory study is intended to be an introductory model for studying and understanding the structure of the impact of deployment among US Army Reservists.

T1  - Instructional design model for promoting meaningful learning and problem solving skills for accounting information system students
AN  - 304767906
AB  - Learning complex concepts with technology is both a challenge and an opportunity for designers of distant learning programs. The accounting practitioner faces increased pressure to obtain skills related to information systems and problem solving. This increase is the result of amplified risk assessment responsibility created by the recent Sarbanes-Oxley legislation and the information technology revolution. Instructional design in the accounting field must change in response to these new advanced skills required by practitioners. This quasi-experimental study addressed the need for innovation in accounting instruction by exploring the value of an online instructional design model that promotes meaningful learning of information system concepts, and problem solving skills for accounting information system students. This instructional design model incorporated concept mapping for visual representation of students' conceptual frameworks as they solved a complex real world case problem in virtual learning communities. The research design involved students in four accounting information systems courses, divided into control and experimental groups. The instructional course design model was used as the experimental groups' treatment and ANCOVA statistic was used to determine any significant difference in student approaches' to learning, problem solving ability, and conceptual understanding. The results indicated statistically significant positive increase in deep or meaningful approach along with an equally significant decrease in surface or superficial approach to learning for experimental groups. The study may influence how online course designers use innovative information technology to improve accountants' lifelong learning skill attainment and tenacity to detect business fraud and prevent financial scandals.

T1  - Psychosocial competency of the English as a second language nursing student: A comparative study
AN  - 304738318
AB  - Nurses must be capable of recognizing the client's psychosocial and physiological needs. The nurse's ability to do so impacts the outcome of the healthcare experience and may impact future health care encounters. English as a second language (ESL) nurses and non-ESL nurses must both be able to identify the client's psychosocial issues. Little information exists on the ESL students' ability to identify the client's psychosocial needs. This study compared the 459 psychosocial needs scores of 25,782 ESL and non-ESL senior nursing students who took the HESI exam between September 1, 2005 and August 31, 2006 to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), correlation analysis, and regression analysis were performed using SPSS 13.0.   Mean scores were 62.33 for the native English (non-ESL) examinees and 59.57 for the ESL group (p<.001). An ANOVA was conducted to determine if there was a significant difference in the mean psychosocial needs scores of ESL and non-ESL HESI examinees based on age, gender, educational program (Bachelors vs. Associate Degree Program), and ethnicity. All variables were significant at p<.01. However the Eta2</super> was negligible, thus suggesting that there was a weak, but significant difference in psychosocial scores based on native language. Pearson's Product Moment Correlation(r) and Spearman's Rho were .058 and .069 respectively suggesting that native language was a weak correlate of psychosocial needs scores. The regression coefficient calculation was F(8,71)=10.05 (p<.001), but the Beta values of the regression analysis were small and negated the regression analysis. The limited effect size (Eta2), small partial correlation coefficients, and Beta values were secondary to the large study population.   The data suggests that ESL student's grasp of the client's psychosocial needs requires further study. Although underutilized in nursing education, concept maps have been used to teach psychosocial nursing and could be a possible solution for improving the ESL student's psychosocial needs scores.

T1  - Understanding how organizational values play into a framework of continuous improvement
AN  - 304719704
AB  - This is a qualitative study that uses insider action research methodology to investigate an educational service center's drive to create shared language around continuous improvement in order to better serve the various needs of the school districts with which they work. This dissertation chronicles the process through which nine educational consultants built a parallel system of integrated learning mechanisms to readily adapt to the changes mandated by the state board of education and No Child Left Behind (NCLB).    One of the unintended consequences that resulted from the beginning stages of this study was the emergence of an organizational values model. This emanated from the coded responses of Appreciative Inquiry interviews employed in order to identify the common narrative that holds the members of this organization together. The model consists of four components: Strategic Process, Collaboration, Communication, and Leadership. It was significant in that it not only provided the organization with a visual representation of its values, but also it guided them in their efforts of developing a strategic process for continuous improvement.    This dissertation contributes to the field of organization development because it provides insight to understanding the life giving properties of individuals, how these properties evolve into organizational values, how these values are manifested in behavior, and how this behavior forms the foundation for eliciting continual improvement.    Key terms. action research; insider action research; appreciative inquiry; organizational values; shared language; continuous improvement

AB  - هدفت هذه الدراسة إلى استقصاء فاعلية التدريس القائم على الجمع بين استراتيجيتي نصوص التغيير المفاهيمي وخريطة المفاهيم في الفهم المفاهيمي بجهاز دوران الدم في الإنسان لدى طالبات الصف التاسع الأساسي مقارنة بالطريقة التقليدية في تدريس الأحياء.وتم إجراء مقابلات مع (10) طالبات من طالبات الصف العاشر الأساسي وذلك لمعرفة الفهم الخطأ الشائع لمفاهيم جهاز دوران الدم في الإنسان لديهن. واستخدمت نتائج المقابلات وأدبيات البحث ذات الصلة في تطوير اختبار مفاهيم جهاز دوران الدم في الإنسان، والذي تم استخدامه في قياس الفهم المفاهيمي لدى الطالبات في هذا الموضوع، حيث تم إعطاؤه كاختبار قبلي واختبار بعدي لمجموع (71) طالبة من طالبات الصف التاسع الأساسي يدرسن في فصلين في إحدى المدارس الأساسية في مدينة المفرق.وتكونت المجموعة التجريبية من صف عدد طالباته (36) طالبة، تم تدريسهن باستراتيجية تجمع ما بين استراتيجيتي نصوص التغيير المفاهيمي وخريطة المفاهيم. وتكونت المجموعة الضابطة من صف عدد طالباته (35) طالبة، تم تدريسهن بالطريقة التقليدية. وقد تم استخدام علامات الطالبات القبلية على مقياس مهارات عمليات العلم وعلى اختبار مفاهيم جهاز دوران الدم في الإنسان كمتغيرين مشتركين.وأظهرت نتائج تحليل التباين المصاحب ( ANCOVA ) المستخدم للتصميم القبلي – البعدي لمجموعتين، وجود فروق دالة إحصائياً في الفهم المفاهيمي بجهاز دوران الدم في الإنسان بين المجموعتين التجريبية والضابطة بعد المعالجة التجريبية، ولصالح طالبات المجموعة التجريبية.وأشارت النتائج إلى ارتفاع نسبة الفهم العلمي السليم لدى طالبات المجموعة التجريبية بعد المعالجة التجريبية من 18.42% إلى 2.78% اي بنسبة زيادة مقدارها 34.36%، إلا أن هذه النسبة لم ترتفع لدى طالبات المجموعة الضابطة بالمقدار نفسه، إذ ارتفعت نسبة الفهم العلمي السليم لدى طالبات المجموعة الضابطة بعد الانتهاء من التدريس من 16.53% إلى 41.84%، أي بنسبة زيادة مقدارها 25.31%. وخلصت الدراسة إلى عدد من التوصيات في ضوء النتائجAlternate abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effectiveness of combining conceptual change texts and concept mapping strategy on students' conceptual understanding of the human circulatory system, compared with the traditional method. To determine misconceptions concerning human circulatory system, 10 tenth-grade female student' were interviewed. In the light of the findings obtained from students interviews and related literature, the human circulatory system concepts test was developed. The students' conceptual understanding of human circulatory system was measured using this test. The test was administered as a pretest and post-test to a total of 71 ninth-grade female students' in two intact classes of the same basic school located in Mafraq city. The experimental group was a class of 36 female students' who received conceptual change texts and concept mapping instruction. A class of 35 female students' comprised the control group who received traditional instruction. Science processes skills Test and pretest scores were used as covariates in this study. A pretest-posttest control group design utilizing the analysis of covariance (ANCOV A) showed a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups in the favour of the experimental group after treatment. The results indicated that while the average percentage of students in the experimental group hold scientifically correct view had risen from 18.42% to 52.78% again of 34.36%, the percentage of correct responses of the students in the control group had increased from 16.53% to 41.84%, again of 25.31% after treatment. Several recommendations were suggested upon the results of the study.

T1  - ENGLISH LANGUAGE TEACHING WITH AN ELECTRONIC CONCEPT MAPPING
AN  - 2667016557
AB  - Educational technologies have contributed greatly to the improvement on the process of education. Besides contributing to education directly the development in new technologies made it almost compulsory to bring new approaches in teaching methods. Among these contributions can be mentioned the application of IT in the teaching. There is an ever-increasing positive impact on learning of combining technological materials with teaching methods, or using them as teaching material. Electronic concept mapping can be considered as a teaching method to help motivation and meaningfulness with its features being contextual, visual, multi-dimensional and interactive. Concept maps are of significant structure in language teaching because of their cognitive complexity, coherence and taxonomic organization. As concepts are contextual in English, this will create an appropriate atmosphere for it to be learnt together with its phonetic and linguistic structure. In this study a model of e-concept maps has been used as an alternative teaching method.

T1  - Concept Mapping in Science Class: A Case Study of fifth grade students
AN  - 1287041985
AB  - The purpose of this research project was to determine the effects of incorporating concept mapping on the achievement of fifth grade students in science class. The study was conducted with twenty-three students at Ata Elementary School, Trabzon, Turkey. The students were tested with teacher-constructed pre- and post tests containing 20 multiple-choice questions. The pupils in the experimental and control groups were exposed to the same teaching techniques covering a unit on heat and temperature. They were given the same pretest after the initial lessons. However, after the pretest, the control group was given a traditional oral review of the material and the experimental group was exposed to the review by the use of Inspiration, which is computer based concept mapping tool. After these reviews, the students on both groups were given the posttest. Test scores were analyzed for any statistically significantly difference in the scores on the test. The results from present study indicate that concept mapping has a noticeable impact on student achievement in science classes.

T1  - Learning With Concept and Knowledge Maps: A Meta-Analysis
AN  - 214114947
AB  - This meta-analysis reviews experimental and quasi-experimental studies in which students learned by constructing, modifying, or viewing node-link diagrams. Following an exhaustive search for studies meeting specified design criteria, 67 standardized mean difference effect sizes were extracted from 55 studies involving 5,818 participants. Students at levels ranging from Grade 4 to postsecondary used concept maps to learn in domains such as science, psychology, statistics, and nursing. Posttests measured recall and transfer. Across several instructional conditions, settings, and methodological features, the use of concept maps was associated with increased knowledge retention. Mean effect sizes varied from small to large depending on how concept maps were used and on the type of comparison treatment. Significant heterogeneity was found in most subsets.

T1  - Skill requirements for logistics license in Taiwan
AN  - 216864848
AB  - This paper attempts to examine the key logistics related skills required at the various levels of management logistics from the licensing certification perspective. This exploratory study utilizes the concept mapping methodology to combine the qualitative expert data with quantitative multivariate statistical analysis. The research results suggest that certain components of logistics skills are more important than others depending on the level of management. Assessment format preferences also differ at each assessment level. This paper is not designed to produce a high level of precision in the output. Instead, this study is structured to explore the possibility of building a licensing/certification framework in Taiwan. This study serves as a "blueprint" of the logistics certification program in Taiwan and provides a practical reference list for logistics-related firms for the purpose of training and recruiting. Another implication is that the logistics certification program for the middle-level logisticians deserves the highest priority over the operational and strategic levels. This study offers an important first step to establishing an executable logistics licensing/certification program/system.

T1  - CONCEPT MAPPING: An Effective, Active Teaching-Learning Method
AN  - 236623671; 16921805
AB  - Nurse educators, under pressure to prepare graduates who are able to think critically and solve problems in a variety of clinical practice settings, require active teaching strategies to promote meaningful learning, instead of relying on traditional methods that promote rote memorization. A review of the current state of the science with regard to concept mapping demonstrates that this teaching-learning method assists nurse educators to prepare graduates to think critically in the complex health care environment. However, further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of concept mapping on the graduate's performance on the NCLEX exam and on critical thinking and prioritization skills in the clinical environment.

T1  - Student-Generated Visualization as a Study Strategy for Science Concept Learning
AN  - 1287050368
AB  - Mixed methods were adopted to explore the effects of student-generated visualization on paper and on computers as a study strategy for middle school science concept learning. In a post-test-only-control-group design, scores were compared among a control-group (n=28), a group that was trained to visualize on paper (n=30), and a group that was trained to visualize on computers (n=34). The paper group and the computer group performed significantly better on the post-test than the control group. Visualization as a study strategy had positive effects whether students used paper or computers to generate their visualizations. However, no significant difference existed between the paper group and the computer group’s scores. Qualitative results indicated that students who were trained to visualize on paper or on computers had positive attitudes toward the use of visualization as a study strategy, and they engaged more in purposeful tasks during study time than the control group. However, several participants in the computer group felt negatively about the use of visualization; they claimed that visualization demanded too much time and effort. Attitudes toward visualization as a study strategy differed within groups indicating that visualization might interact with learner characteristics.

T1  - The Influence of Teaching Note-Taking and Information Mapping on Learning and Recalling in Science
AN  - 1288364801
AB  - This work describes an experimental research on note taking and concept mapping in a science class of 5 graders in Kayseri (Central Anatolia, Turkey) in the academic year 2002 - 2003. Gained results are in favor of convictions that view note taking as an effective learning strategy. At least it was more effective than concept mapping in the experiments of the present study. A possible reason for this is that students benefited from their notes by recapitulating lesson contents whereas concept maps were not used in such a way. This assumption is supported by other experimental evidence that ascribe the advantages of note taking to its function as external memory store that helps students to better process lesson contents.

T1  - The effect of concept mapping on critical thinking skills and dispositions of junior and senior baccalaureate nursing students
AN  - 304920077
AB  - Teaching and assessing critical thinking have great professional benefit to nursing education (Daley, 1996, Facione, 1996). Major issues still center on and are discussed by nurse educators about the importance of teaching strategies that enhance critical thinking skills and measurements of critical thinking (Adams, 1999; Daley, Shaw, & Balistrieri, 1999; Facione & Facione, 1997). The purposes of this quasi experimental study, using a pretest-posttest control group design were twofold. The first purpose was to explore the effect of concept mapping, as a metacognitive teaching strategy on the critical thinking skills and dispositions of junior and senior level baccalaureate nursing students. The second purpose was to evaluate the changes in students' concept mapping skills over time. This research was based upon David Ausubel's theory of meaningful learning (1968) and Joseph Novak and Bob Gowin's (1984) work on the application of meaningful learning using concept mapping. The convenience sample included 32 students in the experimental group and 45 students in the control group. The participants were enrolled in accredited generic baccalaureate nursing programs. The students in the experimental group developed two concept maps over the course of a full academic semester. The California Critical Skills Test (CCTST) and the California Critical Thinking Disposition Inventory (CCTDI) were used to measure the variables. Novak and Gowin's (1984) scoring criteria were used to score the concept maps. The pretest scores of the two groups did not differ significantly. The experimental and control groups did not differ on CCTST or CCTDI posttest scores. There was no relationship between critical thinking skills and dispositions scores. Nursing students who used concept mapping showed no increase in their CCTST and CCTDI on posttest scores. The first concept maps showed fewer concepts, and less connecting of concepts than the second concept maps, supporting Ausabel's Meaningful Learning Theory. The findings of this study suggest that concept mapping triggers critical thinking, which guides the student to engage in meaningful learning. However, the need still exists for researchers to use other critical thinking tools that may capture students' growth of critical thinking over time.

T1  - A middle-range theory to guide the promotion, support, or improvement of spiritually -sensitive care in hospital settings
AN  - 305428154
AB  - In spite of a significant body of scholarship and numerous policy recommendations to promote spiritually sensitive health care, many factors block the full realization of this goal. Barriers include inadequate administrative support of professional chaplaincy services, discomfort and uncertainty among licensed medical practitioners, and conflicting public policies.    The purpose of this study was to develop a middle-range theory to elucidate the potentially helpful and feasible actions related to law, policy, and society that can be implemented to promote, support, or improve spiritually sensitive care in hospital settings.    The grounded theory method of inquiry was used. Grounded theory is a qualitative, inductive process that leads to the emergence of middle-range theory out of the data collected from observation, experience, and reflection. Data were analyzed using the concept-mapping system created by Concept Systems, Inc.® to generate a series of maps to illustrate the theoretical model that emerged. Twenty-six licensed medical professionals volunteered to participate in this study. Each met the inclusion criteria, which required at least one unit of clinical pastoral education or other training in pastoral care and work experience in a hospital setting within the last seven years.    The resulting middle-range theory represents the collective opinions of this sample of clinicians who share the “insider” view of the challenges faced in addressing the spiritual needs of patients in hospital settings. Using this theoretical framework to guide decision-making related to research, education, and scholarship will help to ensure that future work occurs in a logical and efficient manner, enabling scholars, policymakers, and clinicians to address what are perceived to be the most helpful and feasible next steps.

T1  - The lived experiences of lesbians over 50 as patients in primary healthcare settings
AN  - 305425349
AB  - With the overall aging population in the U.S., it is anticipated that a significant proportion of elder Americans, including lesbians, have health conditions that warrant an increased understanding of geriatric healthcare experiences. Few studies have examined the primary healthcare experiences of aging lesbians. The purpose of this investigation was to examine the lived experiences of lesbians over the age of 50 as patients in primary healthcare settings.    Using North American, descriptive phenomenology, principles of concept mapping and purposive sampling techniques, interviews were conducted with 15 lesbians over the age of 50. All women were U.S. citizens and had been patients in a primary healthcare setting at least one time in their adult lives. Four themes emerged from the data. They included patterns of disclosure, experiences of homophobia and heterosexism, experiences of ageism and visions of an ideal provider. While findings were consistent with previous research, two overarching themes became evident. First, lesbians over 50 are virtually invisible in primary healthcare settings. Second, over the years, the healthcare system has remained static by doing little to understand the growing needs of this population thus providing culturally incompetent care.    Using the Culturally Competent Model of Care developed by Campinha-Bacote implications for healthcare practice and education include increasing awareness and knowledge of the needs of lesbians over 50, addressing homophobia and heterosexism in healthcare settings, and creating learning experiences to improve skill and extend competent care to diverse populations. Recommendations for future research include incorporating a variety of phenomenological philosophies and methods to investigate the research question, exploring the concepts of homophobia and heterosexism and employing Structural Equation Modeling to investigate the relationships between the identified themes. All recommendations have the potential to make lesbians over 50 visible, thus potentially improving their well-being.

T1  - Live, virtual, and constructive environments for performance support
AN  - 305419794
AB  - As military systems become more complex, the operation and support of these systems becomes intrinsically more difficult. The U.S. Army's current procurement process relies on industry to provide embedded training and performance support tools for the systems they produce. These tools are relatively new and in the early stages of development. As yet, they have failed to meet the needs of the technicians that are required to support these complex systems. Current efforts to provide enabling technologies that enhance the capabilities of automotive maintenance technicians are concentrated in three professional communities. First is the Performance Improvement community where work is focused on developing and implementing performance support system technologies that deliver information that is stored in information systems. Second is the Knowledge Management community working on organizational knowledge management techniques that capture, store, and map information that is delivered to workers within an organization. The third is the Training and Education community focusing on developing curriculum and delivery systems that support “life-long-learning” requirements.    This dissertation addresses an essential component of performance systems, namely the ability to deliver the knowledge needed to guide a problem solver to a solution state, thereby enhancing worker capabilities. This objective is met by developing the LockTel Framework that provides a construct for segmenting knowledge into three environments for performance support, the live, the virtual, and the constructive environments. It provides a means for the maintenance technician to gain knowledge associated with completing a given task. Seventy-eight maintenance technician trainees at an U.S. Army training center tested the framework. The hypothesis behind the proposed construct was strongly supported, thereby establishing the foundation for future work in live, virtual, and constructive environments for performance support.

T1  - Super Lean: A streamlined transactional process improvement paradigm
AN  - 305395916
AB  - This case study was conducted to determine which factors drove the success of a tailored Lean/Six Sigma approach developed by a small service organization within Lockheed Martin. Quality initiatives such as Lean and Six Sigma have been successfully deployed predominantly in large manufacturing organizations, but their translation for use in small transactional business areas has been challenging because these initiatives have not been focused on transactional processes in smaller organizations. This study examined success factors of traditional deployments and sought to determine success factors unique to small service applications.    The findings confirmed key concepts identified by other researchers in implementing Lean/Six Sigma programs of strong visible leadership, dedicated resources, employee empowerment, and alignment with business objectives. Additional findings based on the deployment in this study include the need to tailor the deployment to the culture of the organization, use service examples rather than manufacturing examples in the training, establish a strong leading coalition to facilitate the deployment across the organization, and capitalize on the agility inherent in a smaller organization to foster a culture of change.    The case study demonstrated that the concepts of Lean and Six Sigma can be successfully deployed in small service organizations to increase their potential to survive in an increasingly competitive global economy. The case study can serve as a foundation for other research to extend the use of proven traditional initiatives so they can be more universally applied.

T1  - Concept matching in informal node -link knowledge representations
AN  - 305024274
AB  - Information stored by managed organizations in free text documents, databases, and engineered knowledge repositories can often be processed as networks of conceptual nodes and relational links (concept graphs). However, these models tend to be informal as related to new or multi-source tasks. This work contributes to the understanding of techniques for matching knowledge elements: in informal node-link knowledge representations, drawn from existing data resources, to support user-guided analysis. Its guiding focus is the creation of tools that compare, retrieve, and merge existing information resources.
Three essays explore important algorithmic and heuristic elements needed to leverage concept graphs in real-world applications. Section 2 documents an algorithm which identifies likely matches between student and instructor concept maps aiming to support semi-automatic matching and scoring for both classroom and unsupervised environments. The knowledge-anchoring, similarity flooding algorithm significantly improves on term-based matching by leveraging map structure and also has potential as a methodology for combining other informal, human-created knowledge representations. Section 3 describes a decompositional tagging approach to organizing (aggregating) automatically extracted biomedical pathway relations. We propose a five-level aggregation strategy for extracted relations and measure the effectiveness of the BioAggregate tagger in preparing extracted information for analysis and visualization. Section 4 evaluates an importance flooding algorithm designed to assist law enforcement investigators in identifying useful investigational leads. While association networks have a long history as an investigational tool, more systematic processes are needed to guide development of high volume cross jurisdictional data sharing initiatives. We test path-based selection heuristics and importance flooding to improve on traditional association-closeness methodologies.
Together, these essays demonstrate how structural and semantic information can be processed in parallel to effectively leverage ambiguous network representations of data. Also, they show that real applications can be addressed by processing available data using an informal concept graph paradigm. This approach and these techniques are potentially useful for workflow systems, business intelligence analysis, and other knowledge management applications where information can be represented in an informal conceptual network and that information needs to be analyzed and converted into actionable, communicable human knowledge.

T1  - CONCEPT MAPPING - EXPLORING ITS VALUE AS A MEANINGFUL LEARNING TOOL IN ACCOUNTING EDUCATION
AN  - 203143756
AB  - A framework for using concept mapping for meaningful learning in accounting education is presented. It includes a review of the extant literature on the effectiveness of concept mapping, an inventory of ready-to-use concept maps for introductory accounting, and a step-by-step guide to introduce concept mapping in the classroom. In addition, a limited research study on learning outcomes is discussed as well as constraints in using this pedagogical approach. Concept mapping is widely used in other disciplines as an enriching learning tool to help students organize information and develop higher-order thinking skills. It involves a process of externalizing, through drawing and diagrams, the mental connections and association patterns that a student makes on knowledge learned (Angelo and Cross, 1993). It is an innovative classroom pedagogy that promotes development of self-learning and life-long learning skills sought by the early change agents in the accounting profession, validated more recently in the joint AAA, AICPA, IMA report (Albrecht and Sack, 2000).

T1  - Concept Mapping in Pulmonary Physiology Using Pathfinder Scaling
AN  - 2259153144
AB  - This three-part article begins with a brief presentation of a framework that describes different approaches to conduct and report research on expert knowledge. The framework contrasts direct vs. indirect approaches and provides examples of each. Second, the article gives a detailed description of the methods and results of three concept mapping studies in pulmonary physiology that employ Pathfinder scaling, an indirect approach. The studies derive concepts maps for a variety of faculty experts individually and in groups. Two of the studies focus on changes in students' concept maps of the pulmonary physiology concepts as a result of instruction. Changes are gauged in terms of the degree to which students' concept maps approximate instructors' concept maps due to educational interventions. An index of student-instructor concept map similarity is also correlated with student performance on final examinations. The article concludes by articulating several “next steps” in the Feinberg Northwestern and Wisconsin program of health sciences education research on concept mapping using Pathfinder scaling.

T1  - A Collaborative Approach to Nutrition Education for College Students
AN  - 213037915; 15495884
AB  - It is well established in the literature that college students have poor eating habits and that many barriers exist to achieving optimal nutrition for this busy population. Little is known about students' perceptions of this problem or suggestions for improving their dietary habits. Similarly, college health professionals need innovative approaches to nutritional education. In an effort to develop an online nutrition resource specifically geared to college students, the authors assessed the availability of Internet-based nutritional information for this population and conducted focus groups with students and health professionals to identify relevant nutrition concerns. They used concept-mapping techniques to conduct a systematic analysis of the qualitative information generated from their focus group participants. Their findings emphasize the need for targeted resources for college students and the importance of using students' suggestions in developing nutrition programs.

T1  - Assessing primary science learning: beyond paper and pencil assessment
AN  - 1956437827
AB  - [...]this article attempts to give an overview of the different assessment strategies that teachers can choose from to better evaluate science learning in their pupils.

The first is the degree to which the relevant conceptual knowledge is represented accurately in the portfolio product, and the second is the degree to which the portfolio product meets the specified performance outcomes, which include the degree to which the relevant concepts are used on an explanatory or interpretative basis by pupils.

[...]there is no need to develop numbered scoring systems or rubrics, because they are not specific enough to provide evidence of meaningful student learning. e)Questions and Answers Open-ended questions mimic good classroom strategies and encourage thinking (Lowery, 2000), both of which are helpful to teachers in understanding how pupils go about finding an answer, solving a problem, or drawing a conclusion.

Peer assessment means making judgments based on individual responsibilities that are performed for the benefit of the group.

[...]in peer assessment, pupils are aware that they are communicating to an audience, and that writing and reporting is therefore undertaken for a purpose (Lindsay & Clarke, 2001).

[...]by using challenging and exciting alternative formative assessment methods, teachers will be able to perceive the development of meaningful modes of inquiry and science understanding by pupils (Lowery, 2000).

[...]formative assessment has the potential to drive changes in teaching that can improve the conceptual understanding of pupils dramatically, and teachers necessarily must alter the way in which they evaluate this learning and formative assessment to effect this change (Dougherty, 1997).

T1  - Concept Mapping and Science Achievement of Middle Grade Students: JRCE
AN  - 203863873
AB  - This study examined the effects of concept mapping on the science achievement of middle grade science students. The subjects were 182 eighth-grade students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes by ability levels. The ability level variable also was examined as a possible effect on student achievement. Two teachers were involved in teaching a unit on weather for nine weeks. An objective weather test and six performance assessment items were used to measure achievement. For this group of students, analyses indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students, as measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that the effect of concept mapping on science achievement is not clear, but that lower ability students appear to have better success with concept mapping than higher ability students.

T1  - Active Learning Of Chemical Engineering Principles Using A Solar Panel / Water Electrolyzer / Fuel Cell System
AN  - 2317855285
AB  - Modules are described that provide experimental/analytical investigation of traditional chemical engineering concepts within the framework of a solar/hydrogen renewable energy cycle. Module lessons cover photovoltaics, thermodynamics, stoichiometry, characteristic current-voltage curves/efficiency, kinetics and transport. A self-contained solar panel / electrolyzer / gas storage containers / polymer electrolyte fuel cell (PEFC) device along with separately purchased (or borrowed) spotlight, power supply, multimeters, and decade resistors are used for all experiments. The experiments are of short duration (15-50 minutes), simple, and produce data that can be analyzed by/used to verify traditional chemical engineering relations (given a few supplemental electrochemical engineering equations). The equipment used in the modules is inexpensive, simple to operate, safe, portable and commercially available. Ideally, this will permit multiple “systems” to be purchased and used simultaneously by students, providing a truly hands-on small group experience.
Modules can be used at all levels of the undergraduate curriculum (freshman through senior) and can be used in multiple classes (Freshman Engineering, Intro to Chemical Engineering, Thermodynamics, Kinetics, Transport, Laboratory Practice, and Electives) to illustrate appropriate material. Figure 1 contains a concept map linking modules to concepts within the curricula that are addressed in this paper. Use of the modules can be preceded by classroom discussions of the hydrogen economy, its projected political, social, and environmental impacts (both locally and globally) and/or the challenges associated with converting to such an economy. The modules can also be modified for use at the pre-college level for a wide variety of projects and/or simple in-class or public demonstrations.
Motivation There are several motives behind this work. The primary motive is to provide instructors with “active learning” modules that can be easily imported into traditional lecture courses to enhance student retention of basic principles in multiple subject areas of chemical engineering. The exercises have been designed to be “instructor friendly”, i.e. they are simple and can be performed during a normal 50 minute lecture. The equipment used in these experiments is relatively inexpensive compared to pilot scale equipment of similar nature, thus multiple set-ups can be purchased for use in a single class. An excellent instruction manual is provided by the manufacturers of the solar panel / electrolyzer / fuel cell system and many of the experiments described here are adaptations of experiments described in the manual[1].

T1  - Developing And Assessing An Undergraduate Nuclear Engineering Program At The U.S. Military Academy
AN  - 2317843813
AB  - In 2002 the U.S. Military Academy (USMA) at West Point established a nuclear engineering (NE) major beginning with graduates of the Class of 2005. The major represents a significant broadening of the West Point academic program and will provide the Army with additional nuclear trained officers as leaders in homeland defense, health physics, and the development of national nuclear defense and policy. A four-step evaluation and assessment process has been developed to assess accomplishment of program goals. Through the use of concept maps, block learning objectives, rubrics, and embedded evaluation instruments, changes to the program can be made while ensuring that USMA continues to graduate outstanding officers and leaders.
In 2002, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point established a nuclear engineering (NE) major available for study beginning with the Class of 2005. The NE curriculum was developed to meet all accreditation requirements for the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET). The establishment of the NE major represents a significant broadening of the West Point nuclear program, and will provide the Army additional officers schooled in nuclear disciplines. Cadets first develop strong fundamental skills in mathematics, physics, and general science. They then apply these fundamental skills to the study of nuclear power plants, nuclear weapons, radiation effects, radiation shielding, and the environmental impact of nuclear power. Embedded design problems reinforce and integrate concepts presented in the classroom. To determine if our courses accomplish specified outcomes, we have developed an innovative methodology to assess accomplishment of program outcomes through a process of assessing embedded indicators.
The splitting of the nucleus has made available to mankind an almost limitless source of energy. This energy source is currently used throughout the world to generate electricity in nearly 450 nuclear power plants. In addition many nations, including potential adversaries, have acquired nuclear weapons. Such widespread use of nuclear energy, and the proliferation of nuclear weapons, suggests that officers in the Army of the 21st century should have some knowledge of nuclear processes. NE is relevant to today’s Army for many other reasons. Officers must be effective leaders in a nuclear or radiation environment, they may participate in homeland defense as part of a nuclear and radiation detection task force, or work with

T1  - Developing Innovative Multimedia Instructional Modules For Control Flow Theory
AN  - 2317843702
AB  - In this paper the development of prototype instructional modules for teaching Control Flow Theory is discussed. The modules are intended for use by practicing engineers as a self-paced, asynchronous, personalized learning material, either on-line or off-line. First, the motivation of this work and the selection of software used in the modules are presented, then the lessons learned in the development process are further discussed and future improvements of the modules are proposed.
The technical content of each module was organized using concept maps, specifically the software produced by the Institute for Human and Machine Cognition (IHMC CmapTools v2.9.1). Most of the animation used in modules is produced in Macromedia’s Flash, supplemented by scientific simulations realized in Mathcad. Each user’s progress in covering the material is tracked using Macromedia’s Authorware capabilities. The difference between Authorware and a Learning Management System such as WebCT is also discussed.
Motivation
In April 2002, NASA initiated and funded a seven university consortium led by Old Dominion University’s Center for Advanced Engineering Environments to develop the Hierarchical Learning Network as one of the initiatives searching for remedies for the projected loss of engineering expertise due to aging of present workforce and a continuous decrease in the number of graduating engineers. This learning and research network will provide a prototype for linking diverse, geographically dispersed teams and facilities, combining their expertise to create a new generation of skilled scientists and engineers who can work across traditional disciplines and perform in rapidly changing environments1.
The consortium proposed to capitalize on the faculty expertise and research facilities at Old Dominion University, University of Florida, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, George Mason University, MIT Media Lab, Cornell University, and Syracuse University, to provide world-class engineering education and aerospace workforce training. The consortium will develop new multi-university group-teaching courses and advanced learning modules with the objective to ensure the rapid transfer of research results to industry2.

T1  - Intelligent support for knowledge capture and construction
AN  - 305204819
AB  - In traditional views of knowledge management, knowledge capture is seen as primarily knowledge acquisition, capturing knowledge that already exists within the expert. This thesis proposes an alternative approach, “knowledge extension,” based on the premise that a knowledge model evolves from coordinated processes of knowledge acquisition and knowledge construction. In this view, it is crucial to support experts' construction of new knowledge as they extend existing knowledge models. This dissertation develops and evaluates artificial intelligence methods to facilitate knowledge extension, especially in the context of knowledge modeling via concept mapping. The problem of supporting knowledge extension raises two research questions: First, how can topic descriptors be algorithmically extracted from concept maps, and second, how to use these topic descriptors to identify candidate topics on the Web with the right balance of novelty and relevance. To address these questions, this thesis develops the theoretical framework required for a “topic suggester'” to aid information search in the context of a knowledge model under construction. Finally, it describes and evaluates EXTENDER, an implemented support tool based on this framework. The proposed algorithms have been developed and tested within the framework of CmapTools, a widely-used system for supporting knowledge modeling using concept maps. However, their generality makes them applicable to a broad class of knowledge modeling systems, and to Web search in general.

T1  - What's gender got to do with it? A ten -year retrospective case study of a Management Development for Women Program
AN  - 305132296
AB  - This 10-year retrospective case study of a Management Development for Women Program uses a theory-driven mixed method holistic design and is jointly sponsored by St. Mary's University and Mt. St. Vincent University in Halifax, N.S. Subjects are the graduates of the MDW Program from 1990 to 2001 (N = 137), divided into three chronological groups based on period of enrolment, (1990–93, 1994–97, and 1998–00). The overall findings of this study indicate that women managers still face unique problems relating to gender in both organizational and educational institutions. The results suggest three distinct factors contributed to the success of the MDW program. First, the formal program content increased the participants' profile in their organization, and increased their effectiveness and self-confidence. Second, the culture and unexpected learning, and third, the single-gender feature. For the most part the results validated the conceptual framework under which the program has operated. The findings of the study show that there are still double standards for promotion, which are gender-based, and there are still issues relating specifically to women in management. Therefore, single gender management development programs, which are designed to address these issues, are still needed.

T1  - Making the connections: Women talk about breast self examination
AN  - 305090274
AB  - Breast cancer is a serious health concern for women. Early detection has been hailed as key to reducing the morbidity and mortality associated with this disease. Largely as a result of three large trials that failed to demonstrate a mortality reduction with breast self examination (BSE), the usefulness of this screening method has been seriously questioned. In 2001, the Canadian Task Force for Preventive Health Care concluded there was fair evidence to recommend physicians no longer routinely teach BSE to women. Through reports in the academic and lay literature, women have been advised that BSE may not only be ineffective, but harmful to them. The research problem is that there is a poor understanding of the meaning of BSE to women within a society that does not value it. Previous research on BSE was chiefly concerned with measuring women's knowledge, attitudes and beliefs related to BSE with the primary aim of increasing compliance. Yet, little was known about how women really felt about BSE. To investigate this phenomenon, women were engaged over time in a cycle of collective self-reflective inquiry to explore personal and social factors influencing their practice of BSE. This was achieved through a series of group discussions with two groups of women as they examined their everyday experiences related to BSE. Consistent with a participatory action approach, the women were considered co-researchers and were actively involved in the framing and analysis of the research problem. Thematic analysis allowed for the collaborative identification of the temporal map components that described the context of BSE for these women. These components were later organized by the women into a concept map, which provided a meaningful schematic representation of the meaning of BSE to them. Consistent with a feminist experiential approach, the standpoint of women was considered a valuable source of knowledge. Through this collective inquiry, the women developed a critical consciousness of the commonality of their personal experiences in relation to BSE, and their relationship to the larger social environment. In this way, the women were able to more fully understand the complexity of personal and social factors influencing the meaning of BSE to them, which was empowering. At the beginning of the research process, the women's subject position was characterized by their feelings of vulnerability in relation to their perceptions of breast cancer as a lethal disease and their inferior status in the world in relation to men. BSE is an intensely personal issue for women. It brings to the fore a complex web of interrelated meanings and experiences such as those related to cancer (breast cancer in particular), being a woman (and having breasts), and the health care system (including their treatment by physicians).

T1  - Using concept mapping to aid African American students' understanding in middle grade science
AN  - 222130634
AB  - This article reports on the results of a nine-week investigation that examined the effectiveness of concept mapping on science achievement of 182 African American middle grade science students, distributed into eight intact earth science classes (by ability levels). Ability level was examined as a covariate on student achievement. For this sample of students, analyses of covariance indicated no significant overall effects of treatment on science achievement. A statistically significant effect was found between concept mapping and student achievement among the average students measured by combined performance assessment items. The results suggest that concept mapping has a positive effect on average (lower) ability level African American science students. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - Online Teaching Of "Energy & The Environment"
AN  - 2317730093
AB  - In the Fall of 2002, the Department of Energy & Geo-Environmental Engineering (EGEE) in collaboration with “The John A. Dutton e-Education Institute” (College of Earth and Mineral Sciences) offered a 3-credit web-only version of the existing resident class “Energy & the Environment” at The Pennsylvania State University. The goal of the project was to enable students at any of the University’s 25 campus locations, including its virtual “World Campus,” to participate in the same high-quality, online, learning experience. Expected outcomes included increased enrollments (overcoming room availability issues) and, by virtue of the fact that students would be enabled to study at times and places most convenient to them, a more student- centered learning environment than is typically encountered in large classroom settings. The methodologies and techniques employed to transform an existing lecture-based resident class into a compelling and engaging web-only learning environment are discussed. The goal of this paper, then, is to report what is entailed pedagogically, institutionally, and individually in such a large-scale project in online teaching and learning. Opportunities for formal evaluation of student engagement, and of the relationship between engagement and learning, are also discussed.
Designing and creating an engaging, interactive experience, structuring content for web delivery, and maintaining the dynamic presence of the professor within a virtual environment were all important in the design decisions. The primary challenges were revising the class content to make it appropriate for independent learning, taking full advantage of the technologies and flexibility of the web environment, and enhancing the student-faculty communications despite all interaction taking place entirely across multiple-campuses via an asynchronous network. The application of numerous web-based technologies permitted more interactivity throughout the course resources. Examples of some of these techniques include: mouse-enabled dynamic text and visuals, animated images, charts, and graphs, flash animations, user-controlled 3-D molecular graphics, interactive concept maps, and various computer-based quizzing tools (enabling learning through both success and failures).
Combined, these approaches increased the level of active learning in the course, and the professor’s dynamic nature and personality remained quite intact throughout the course through the use of audio, images, movies, writing style, and various communications channels (audio emails, written emails, and threaded discussions) afforded by the course management system and web environment. Together, these approaches produced an engaging online environment for

T1  - Student and faculty perceptions of nursing education culture and its impact on minority students
AN  - 305333335
AB  - The nursing profession, a predominately white, women's profession, is facing two problems: an increasing nursing shortage, and failure to reflect the United States' growing ethnic and racial diversity. Increased cultural diversity among nurse educators and practitioners is a necessary step to solving both problems, yet recruitment and persistence efforts have fallen short. Minority nursing students have been noted to have more academic difficulty evidenced by lower GPAs and higher program attrition. Traditional explanations such as poor academic preparation or lack of financial support do not adequately explain the difference in performance. This study investigated minority persistence in nursing education from a cultural viewpoint, looking at the impact of higher education and nursing education culture on minority student persistence and performance, and the role of nursing faculty within this culture. This study's purpose was to examine nursing education culture, barriers to success for minority students, and facilitative educational practices. Semi-structured interviews with 43 African-American and white nursing faculty (14) and students (29) from 13 baccalaureate and one community college program were conducted. A concept map was developed describing student processes of Belonging and Becoming a Nurse, and the impact of the nursing program, conflict between nursing values and norms, and welcoming or unwelcoming actions by faculty, students and administrators on student success. Key findings were: a universal perception of struggle in nursing education; the pervasive and negative impact of racial prejudice on black students' experience; the positive impact of welcoming actions and negative impact of unwelcoming actions by faculty, students and administrators on student success; the need for welcoming by all three groups in the nursing program; a conflict between nursing education's values and norms or typical behaviors of nurse educators; and the key role of faculty in influencing minority student success. Implications for practice, policy and research are presented.

T1  - The effect of concept mapping to enhance text comprehension and summarization
AN  - 217687969
AB  - Whether this technique also helps enhance summarizing skill has not yet been examined.

[...]our third objective in this study was to extend and expand on the Chmielewski and Dansereau study to determine whether the concept-mapping training effect can be transferred to posttraining situations in which using this strategy is not required and whether this transfer also applies to summarization capabilities.

[...]a framework functions as a structure to demonstrate the content and serves as a reminder of the gist of the text and the linking between ideas (Alverman, 1981; Moore & Readence, 1984).

[...]constructing an expert map by correcting misplaced concept nodes and links not only preserves the advantages of providing an expert knowledge structure but also corrects possible negligence (McCagg & Dansereau, 1991) and passive knowledge acceptance (Barron & Schwartz, 1984; Katamaya & Robinson, 2000) of readers in reading expert maps.

[...]concept-mapping strategy training not only improves reading comprehension skills but also benefits other linguistic skills related to comprehension, such as text summarization skills.

There is an obvious overlap between this process and text summarization as proposed by Brown and Day (1983).

Because of the similarity in the operations, it makes sense that the learning effects of the concept mapping strategy can transfer to summarization skills.

T1  - Bringing First Year Engineering Students To Reflect On Their Learning Strategies Via A Learning Journal And An End Of Semester Essay In The Context Of A Problem Based And Project Based Learning Curriculum
AN  - 2317699469
AB  - This paper reports on a qualitative appraisal of the ability of first-year engineering students to engage in a metacognitive process about their learning strategies. At the beginning of the semester, texts on learning strategies, reading, concept mapping, emotional competencies, change and stress were distributed to each student and discussed in the classroom. We emphasized the importance for students not only to monitor their performance during the semester but also to look back on their learning strategies and, if necessary, to improve them. To that end, we asked students to periodically write in a personal learning journal their thoughts about their learning strategies. As an incentive, we told them that, as one of their final exams, they would have to write a 7 to 10-page essay about their learning strategies. They were also informed that they would be graded according to their ability to analyse their strategies, whether these strategies were optimal or not. Results of a preliminary analysis of these essays confirm that it is possible to bring first-year engineeering students to reflect on their learning strategies.
1- Introduction The Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering of the Université de Sherbrooke, Québec, Canada, has totally redesigned its Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering Co-operative programs. The first semester of these new programs was offered for the first time in September 2001 to 167 freshmen engineering students.These new curricula are founded on a competency-based framework, following an original learning approach that combines Problem-based and Project-based Learning called APPI (French acronym for « Apprentissage par Problèmes et par Projets en Ingénierie ») 1 . There are no more lectures. Instead, on a repetitive two-week schedule, a small group of nominally 12 students meets twice with a tutor. During the first meeting, students try to solve a given problem with the knowledge they have already acquired and identify what new knowledge is required to fully solve it. Then, they go on to studying and applying their new knowledge. To help them organize their knowledge, we ask them to draw concept maps and procedural maps. During the second meeting, the problem is summarised and solved, using the new knowledge acquired during the first week. As support, students can use only maps they have elaborated during their studies. They have the permission to modify their maps, if necessary, during the meeting, according to what they hear from other students and to what is validated by the tutor. At the end of that second meeting, a fifteen-minute period is set aside to give students an opportunity to exchange on their learning strategies. Students are invited to record their thoughts in their learning journal once at home.

T1  - Concept Mapping As A Form Of Student Assessment And Instruction
AN  - 2317694844
AB  - As part of a concerted effort to improve Biomedical Engineering (BME) education, the Vanderbilt-Northwestern-Texas-Harvard/MIT Engineering Research Center (VaNTH ERC) is investigating alternative methods for assessing students’ conceptual knowledge, and integrating an array of diverse competencies into the curriculum. One potentially useful tool for achieving these goals is concept mapping or the spatial representation of concepts and their interrelationships. This paper describes three studies investigating this potential. In Study One, three groups (i.e., BME undergraduates, graduate students and faculty) constructed concept maps in response to the question, “What are the 10-20 most important concepts in BME?” Group differences were consistent with expert-novice distinctions in structural knowledge. Faculty generated dense networks of higher-order principles (e.g., “the synthesis of engineering and medicine”) and their applications (e.g., “interdisciplinary communication”) while students generated fewer connections among concepts pertaining largely to domain content (e.g., “biotechnology,” “physiology”). Study 2 conducted longitudinal and cross-sectional examinations of the development of expertise. Undergraduates in a yearlong design course responded at two different time points to the question, “What is your current conceptual understanding of what is involved in the BME design process?” Analyses revealed that, relative to maps constructed at the beginning of the course, end of the semester maps used more precise vocabulary, were more coherently constructed, and contained a greater number of connections among concepts. Student maps were also compared to a criterion map created by the course instructor. Study Three will investigate concept mapping as a form of instruction. Learning outcomes of students receiving traditional (i.e., taxonomy-driven presentation of concepts) and innovative (i.e., use of concept mapping as an advance organizer) instruction are being compared. Findings are discussed in terms of their implications for the role of concept mapping as a form of student assessment and instruction, and ultimately, a means to promoting lifelong learning.

T1  - The effect of a metacognitive intervention on approach to learning and self -regulation of learning in baccalaureate nursing students
AN  - 305500000
AB  - The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a metacognitive intervention, specifically concept mapping, on approach to learning and self-regulation of learning in baccalaureate nursing students. Understanding how students approach and regulate learning may offer insight into developing teaching practices aimed at the improvement of student learning.    Approach to learning was measured by the revised Study Process Questionnaire-2 Factor (rSPQ-2F) (Biggs, Kember, & Leung, 2001). Self-regulation of learning was measured by the Strategic Flexibility Questionnaire (SFQ (Cantwell & Moore, 1996). Using a non-equivalent, untreated control group, pretest posttest design, the investigator examined the effect of concept mapping on these outcome variables in a convenience sample (N = 80) of baccalaureate nursing students over the course of a 15-week semester.    Significant group differences were found in the treatment group for the deep approach to learning [F (1) = 5.62, p = .02] and adaptive control beliefs [F (1) = 8.71,  p = .004] in that there was an increase in the deep approach to learning and adaptive control beliefs mean scores at the end of the semester. There were no significant differences between groups for the surface approach to learning, inflexible control beliefs, or irresolute control beliefs. Statistically significant pretest/posttest differences were found in the control group ( n = 43) in both deep approach to learning mean score (t = 2.13, df = 42, p = .04) and surface approach to learning mean score (t = −3.26, df = 42, p = .002). The deep approach to learning mean score decreased and the surface approach to learning mean score increased over the course of the semester.    The findings of this study provide empirical support for the value of concept mapping as a metacognitive intervention. Nurse educators are challenged to examine current pedagogy in relation to student learning. Recommendations for future research include the replication of this study using larger samples of students and conducting a longitudinal study to determine the ongoing and contextual approaches to learning over time. Further research is needed to determine the effect of traditional and non-traditional curricula on approach to learning and self-regulation of learning.

T1  - Developing a competency model-based maintenance manager qualification program utilizing concept mapping methodology
AN  - 305450196
AB  - The problem of this study was to develop a competency model based qualification program for maintenance managers at a Department of Energy facility using an Internet based concept mapping methodology. To accomplish this, 23 maintenance professionals from the project facility and industry viewed as being excellent in the maintenance field participated in this concept mapping exercise via the Internet. Due to workloads and time commitments, 14 maintenance professionals completed this study. Participants were prompted to list those behaviors that they have observed in maintenance managers that they saw as being excellent. A total of 140 statements were generated and edited down to 109 (taking into account redundant statements). From these statements cluster maps were developed and ranked according to importance and similarity. Eleven clusters maps were developed and grouped into five areas of competence; action management competencies, relationship competencies, future-building competencies, business competencies, and professional competencies. From these groups a qualification program plan was developed.

T1  - Enhancing managers' schemas regarding coaching skills using a computer conferencing training intervention
AN  - 305447353
AB  - The level of investment to meet the demand for “soft” skills within today's workforce has steadily increased. Yet there are concerns over both the effectiveness of training in this skill domain and the ability to provide cost-effective training access. The need is for greater precision in defining these skills, designing training to enhance them, and measuring the learning outcomes from such training.    A training course in Coaching Skills was designed using a proposed soft skills training framework, and then delivered to twenty-five practicing managers from six organizations using a computer conference. The cognitive schemas held by these managers regarding this skill domain, were captured using computer-constructed idiographic concept maps. Employing a replicated single subject design, the complexity of their coaching schemas and the similarity of these schemas to that of a domain expert, together with their level of self-efficacy in the skill of coaching, were measured pre- and post-training using quantitative methods. Their belief systems concerning coaching and their behavioral intent to enact the coaching skills were also explored using qualitative methods.    The participants' schema became significantly more similar to the expert schema following the completion of the course, and there was an interesting interaction between changes in schema complexity and similarity. Their level of self-efficacy in coaching also increased significantly. An analysis of the qualitative data indicated that the course had positively impacted their belief systems concerning coaching and that most of the managers had formed an intent to perform the skills back in the workplace.    The study findings indicate that soft skills training can produce positive learning outcomes when the domain and the underlying skill set are clearly defined together. The findings also reinforce past research suggesting that organizations must pay close attention to contextual factors as well as instructional factors if they are to positively influence behavioral intent. When delivering training in a soft skills domain, organizations should consider a medium such as computer conferencing which allows flexibility of participation and may represent a “safer” environment for training in sensitive subject areas. Finally, the study extends the use of concept mapping as a valuable research tool.

T1  - The development of critical thinking skills in associate degree nursing students
AN  - 305441034
AB  - This study examined critical thinking skills of associate degree student nurses from three different nursing programs, Schools A, B, and C that utilized the California Critical Thinking Skills Test as a program assessment tool. Results indicated some degree of improvement in scores from the three programs when comparing scores from beginning to end of each program. However, School C results reflected a significant difference (p < .05) in increase of critical thinking skills. In addition, a survey was sent to students and faculty in an attempt to identify instructional methodologies that may have enhanced critical thinking skills in students. Survey responses indicated that faculty and students perceived that a variety of active learning activities may have assisted students in developing critical thinking skills. Faculty noted that instructional methods which promote analytical thinking effectively in students were: Concept Maps, Case Studies, and Nursing Care Plans. School C faculty specified consistent use of these strategies which could account for the positive results in critical thinking ability of students in that school.

T1  - Effect of concept mapping as a learning strategy on certificate practical nursing students' academic achievement and critical thinking development
AN  - 276651800
AB  - To be academically successful, nursing students need to know how to organize data and connect it to previously acquired knowledge. Concept mapping is an organizational strategy that may aid students in critical thinking and the ability to draw the necessary connections among the knowledge realms required to pass the required rigorous national licensing examination and to deliver safe and effective heath care. This quasi-experimental, non-equivalent control group design with pretest, posttest comparisons found that nursing students' academic achievement, as measured by performance on a multiple-choice examination, was significantly enhanced following instruction in concept mapping strategies. An absence of specific previous research related to the effectiveness of concept mapping on certificate practical nursing students' academic achievement and critical thinking abilities prompted this quantitative study that used a convenience sample (n = 29) recruited from a rural mid-Atlantic certificate practical nursing program. For this investigation concept mapping, an instructional strategy to visually represent and organize knowledge, was used to assist the treatment group participants (n = 15) in their development of conceptual frameworks and critical thinking abilities and served as the independent variable. The control group was not exposed to the concept mapping strategies during the 13-week, medical-surgical nursing course. A criterion-referenced test based on the content of a neuroscience-nursing chapter was piloted in the spring of 2000 and served as the dependent variable in this study that was conducted in the spring of 2001. An analysis of covariance with pretest scores as the covariate indicated that after removing the effects of participants' prior knowledge the posttest performance of the treatment group was statistically significantly different (α = .05) than the non-treatment group. The findings confirm previous research and support the implementation of concept mapping as an instructional tool to improve students' academic success. In addition, 12 students in the treatment group independently created two concept maps. The first map was created prior to receiving instruction on a neuroscience unit of study. Following the unit of study, students in the treatment group reconstructed their first map. Two nurse educators independently scored the student's first and second maps. Critical thinking was measured based on Novak and Gowin's (1984) concept mapping scoring formula. Data analysis demonstrated a statistically significant difference between the first and second concept maps. The findings indicate an increase in nursing students' critical thinking and support the implementation of concept mapping as an outcome measure of critical thinking in nursing education.

T1  - Methods for Measuring the Influence of Concept Mapping on Student Information Literacy
AN  - 2395532535
AB  - Research traditions in education and information retrieval have grown up in parallel worlds, although they share a theoretical foundation that profoundly influences research methodology and best practice in their respective domains. They also share a common problem: the need for a method for analyzing sparse, quantifiable data collected in qualitative studies with small sample sizes. This paper explores the theory of expected information, which uses formulas derived from the Fano measure (1961) and Bayesian statistics (1764), and demonstrates its application in a study on the effects of concept mapping on the searching behavior of tenth-grade biology students.

T1  - Enhancing Teachers' Use of Technology Through Professional Development on Electronic Concept Mapping
AN  - 2259576561
AB  - The majority of public school teachers do not feel well prepared to use instructional technology. Professional development on computer-based concept mapping responds to this concern through focusing on a tool/software that has many applications and is not difficult to master. A subset (n = 18) of science teachers in a Health Sciences and Technology Academy (HSTA) completed a workshop on electronic concept mapping and were provided with school site licenses and other follow-up support (summer institute). They utilized the software in academic enrichment for underserved students, regular classroom instruction, and inservice training for colleagues. Triangulation of findings from data sources (electronic conferencing, lesson plans, workshop evaluations) revealed that HSTA teachers embrace electronic concept mapping as a versatile educational tool. Factors contributing to this enthusiasm included the ease with which students use the software, the transparent nature of the learning process for these students, and the positive attitudes of colleagues whom they have inserviced. The findings from this project are congruent with what experts contend to be critical features of effective teacher professional development: facilitating a community of learners and providing sustained support. This project now funds software use in over 45 public schools.

T1  - Evaluation Of A Simulation And Problem Based Learning Design Project Using Constructed Knowledge Mapping
AN  - 2317791352
AB  - This work describes results from an educational evaluation of an environmental engineering capstone course in which the design project comprised a sophisticated simulation-driven task. The simulation software is called Interactive Site Investigation Software (ISIS), an object- oriented (Java-based) user’s interface through which students collect data describing a subsurface contamination scenario associated with a hazardous waste site. ISIS is intended to serve as a problem-based learning environment for helping students to gain a deeper understanding of theory-based course content while accelerating their exposure to the practical aspects of an engineering design project. To evaluate the extent to which the ISIS is successful in this endeavor, we assessed student outcomes using constructed response knowledge maps (concept maps). The expert criterion map was devised by the instructor and teaching assistant for the course, and included 17 concepts to be linked by 4 relationships. Students were given a tutorial on the mapping exercise, then asked to perform the exercise prior to the start of the ISIS project, and again after the completion of the 5-week project. The class completed both the pretest and posttest mapping exercises in a controlled environment. A list of all student map propositions (192 of a possible 1088) was compiled and each was assigned a score by the instructor (illogical/impossible = 0; pragmatic understanding = 1; scientific understanding = 2; highly principled, scientific understanding = 3). Student maps were scored in terms of proposition quality. Overall, the results suggest that students did acquire knowledge over the course of the ISIS activity. The students’ posttest content score was higher than the pretest, but this difference was not significant. However, it was determined that students introduced significantly more deep propositions in their posttest knowledge map compared to their pretest knowledge map. The students also introduced a significant number of posttest deep propositions that were not part of the expert criterion, suggesting that the ISIS activity promoted learning beyond the scope envisioned by the instructor.
I. Introduction
In this study we examined the implementation of a capstone course in civil engineering on the topic of hazardous waste site assessment. Student teams assumed the role of consultants contracted to carry out a hazardous waste site investigation of an abandoned airfield. The course in this study differed from typical capstone courses in two important ways. First, simulation software was developed to support the site investigation. Second, this course was the subject of

T1  - The professionalization of logistics: A management specialty to meet 21st century challenges
AN  - 252131380
AB  - A review of current management literature reveals the management skills and perspective needed to meet the challenges anticipated in the 21st Century include a cross-functional, multidimensional, life cycle approach emphasizing full integration of all enterprise infrastructure elements—technology, processes, and people. Since the early 1900s, the evolution of professional management specialty disciplines has been responsive to emerging practice needs. The existing management specialty discipline, which can address the identified 21st Century needs, is logistics—not the narrow transportation and distribution perspective, but a comprehensive logistics perspective. The Research Question investigated in this dissertation was “Has logistics practice evolved sufficiently to be recognized as a professional management specialty?”. The theoretical basis for this research was the process for evolution from technical occupation to profession, described by Wilensky (1964) based on his historical examination of 18 occupations, which evolved to professions.    The research design for this study was an exploratory, empirical, non-experimental, cross-sectional, qualitative assessment, case study. Data collection consisted primarily of ex post facto documents review in two stages. In the first stage, the literature relating to professions and the professionalization process was reviewed to produce a characteristics profile of a profession. In stage two, 1,083 documents describing logistics practice and theory were analyzed to produce a descriptive profile of logistics practice and theory. Non-metric Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) techniques, specifically a modified Concept Mapping procedure with Pattern Matching using a 2-point qualitative scale were used to assess the current status of Logistics as a profession. The results indicated a “qualified yes” answer to the research question, since there was support for all seven attitudinal and all 12 structural antecedent dimensions identified. Of significance to logistics and management practitioners and to researchers in both fields, findings indicate a need to increase activities leading to professional self-regulation, logistics theory development, and educational activities for continued technical and managerial skill sets development. This study has extended the research of professionalization into the area of cross-functional, organizational boundary spanning, and technical management specialties.

T1  - Distributed Visual Language Environments for Cooperation and Learning: Applications and Intelligent Support
AN  - 223827454
AB  - An increasing number of collaborative learning environments is based on shared workspace systems using two-dimensional graph-structured visual representations such as argumentation networks and concept maps. We propose an integrated framework that allows for flexibly specifying a wide range of visual languages and plugging in components for operational semantics, adequate feedback and intelligent support. The generic application CardBoard provides card-based user interaction and collaboration by means of different languages in shared workspaces. To enhance modifiability, the interfaces between the distributed heterogeneous system components, particularly between intelligent components and user interfaces, have been standardised.

T1  - Cognitive styles and virtual environments
AN  - 231520112
AB  - The distinction between holists and serialists in learning, and its implications for supporting individual users through user interface design, is studied. Some interesting behavioral patterns of holists and serialists are examined. While holists like to use concept maps, serialists prefer keyword indices. A concept map, or the overview of an underlying structure, is designed for global orientation regarding the overall structure of the subject matter. Having recognized the fuzzy nature of identifying individuals' cognitive styles and learning strategies, a modeling approach based on Kohonen self-organizing feature maps, an artificial neural-network based classification technique, is introduced. This self-organized approach has potential as a possible route for further research and development of adaptive virtual environments.

T1  - Measuring conceptual change in organic chemistry
AN  - 211915145
AB  - Researchers in a variety of disciplines, including chemistry, have become increasingly interested in structural knowledge and how this knowledge changes during the learning process. Nash et al discuss concept mapping, which can be utilized not only as a pedagogical tool to facilitate conceptual change, but also as a technique for assessing conceptual change achieved through other pedagogical techniques.

T1  - Impact of concept-mapping upon meaningful learning and metacognition among foundation-level associate-degree nursing students
AN  - 304676328
AB  - The purpose of this study was: to compare the effects of a brain-based learning and study strategy, concept-mapping; and a traditional learning and study strategy, outlining, on the self-reported measures of meaningful learning and metacognition among foundation-level associate-degree nursing students. The Learning and Study Strategies Inventory (LASSI), developed by Weinstein, Palmer, and Schulte (1987), was used as the instrument to measure the designated meaningful learning subscales of Information Processing, Selecting Main Ideas, and Study Aids as well as the designated metacognition subscales of Attitude, Time Management, Motivation, Anxiety, Concentration, Self-Testing and Test-Taking Strategies. Ausubel's Assimilation Theory (1963) was the conceptual framework guiding this study. The sample consisted of 57 foundation-level, associate-degree nursing students from a large Mid-western technical college.    An untreated control group with a pretest and posttest was the quasi-experimental research design used to study the following hypothesis:   Foundation-level, associate-degree nursing students who utilize a brain-based study strategy over a 4-week period will score higher on measures of meaningful learning and metacognition than foundation-level, associate-degree nursing students who utilize a non brain-based, traditional study strategy over a 4-week period.   Demographic, academic, and data on study attributes were obtained through a questionnaire before the intervention. Descriptive statistics, including frequencies, percentages, and means, were used to describe the sample. An Independent-Samples t-test was used to compare the magnitude of change from pretest to posttest in both groups with the alpha level set at .05. The analyses revealed statistically significant increases among the intervention group in meaningful learning measures of Information Processing, Selecting Main Ideas, and Study Aids as well as in metacognition measures of Attitude, Motivation, and Self-Testing. Crombach's Alpha was used to verify the internal consistency reliability of the LASSI (Weinstein et. al., 1987). Alpha coefficients obtained from this sample were within the acceptable range and comparable with those found in the literature. The results of this study have important implications for nursing and other areas of adult education. The most important ramification of the findings is that concept-mapping effectively promotes meaningful learning and metacognition, as evidenced through self-reported increases in designated LASSI (Weinstein et. al., 1987). subscales.

T1  - Facilitating synthesis and advancing methodological development in strategic planning
AN  - 304624809
AB  - Theory in the field of strategic management has grown tremendously over the last 40 years without a comparable evolution in strategic planning methodologies. Tools and frameworks for conducting strategic planning are grossly inefficient in enabling organizations to envision a desirable future state and chart a course toward achieving organizational goals. Several prominent authors in the field have alluded to the idea that what is required are tools and methods that enable ‘synthesis’ of the complex set of ideas involved in strategy formulation. This investigation considers one promising candidate methodology, the Concept System, in detail, describes how it extends considerably beyond traditional strategic planning methods, shows how it addresses specific issues in the major schools of thought in the literature, describes in detail its use in a real-world strategic planning context, and compares how well it functioned in comparison with a traditional, rational-analytic strategic planning approach. The Concept System is a group decision-making tool that organizes brainstormed statements and ideas from a variety of stakeholders into a series of images called Concept Maps. These maps are interpreted by the group and the final output becomes a framework for developing a comprehensive strategic plan. This approach has the potential to enable integration and, especially synthesis, to occur in strategic planning. As such, the Concept System may provide an answer to Mintzberg et al.'s call for methods that constitute “good practice, not neat theory” and to chart a course for renewed interest in investigating new strategic planning methods to encourage the evolution of theory and practice in the field of strategic management.

T1  - Competencies of the leader of Palestinian community -based non -governmental organization in Israel: A prospective approach
AN  - 304587830
AB  - Palestinian community-based non-governmental organizations (PCBNGOs) in Israel have to cope with a turbulent environment, internally, locally, nationally and internationally. To deal with the opportunities, demands and threats imposed by their environments, the role of the leaders, therefore, is of prime importance. Many of the present leaders, however, have been criticized for their lack of effective leadership and accountability.    This study is exploratory, future-oriented, comparative and combines qualitative and quantitative data. Employing the ‘Concept Mapping’ method, presidents of PCBNGOs from three different areas, i.e. Mixed Palestinian-Jewish cities, segregated Palestinian towns from the North, and segregated Palestinian towns from the South were asked through small discussion groups to predict the most important issues facing their organizations. To succeed in the future, they were then asked to generate, rank order, and sort the abilities that they considered necessary for their leaders.    The study revealed that organizations from all three areas will face similar major issues as well as some different ones. One hundred eight competencies, conceptually divided into 15 clusters, were identified as common to leaders from all areas. All the abilities and clusters were ranked highly. The ratings of the clusters by area and other demographic variables show that their rank ordering according to importance is much the same across all subgroups.    Seven clusters were considered most important: Progressive and Committed Vision with Strategic Adaptability, Systematic, Social Activist, Adaptive Foresight, Interpersonally Open and Responsive, Democratic and Organized. These clusters focus mostly on the leaders and on their relationships with others. Three clusters were considered least important: Financial Know-how, External Acquaintance and Networks, and Diplomatic and Catalytic. These deal mainly with technical-financial issues, and with handling relationships with the outside environment.    The findings indicate that the issues facing the PCBNGOs differ largely from those of their counterparts in Western countries; we see, therefore, that although the leaders need some similar abilities, unique abilities in order to deal with their own environment are also required.

T1  - Noncompliance among elderly diabetic patients: A phenomenological descriptive study
AN  - 220100240
AB  - This study explored the lived experience of noninsulin-dependent diabetic mellitus (NIDDM) elderly clients who bad been determined to be noncompliant with an established diabetic protocol. A nonrandomized purposive sample of 5 NIDDM subjects was selected. Existential phenomenology was used to explore the research question: What is the lived experience of NIDDM elderly diabetics who are noncompliant? Data were collected using a semistructured interview technique. A final validation was produced by returning to the subjects and asking them if the description formulated validated their original responses. According to the interviewed patients, the causative factors for getting diabetes were heredity, marriage, job, and taking care of elderly family members. The difficult aspects in diabetes management were exercise, diet, traveling, and stress control. The patients were responsible for their own diabetes management. To live with diabetes year after year felt normal, a lot easier, or much more difficult. Findings are presented in concept map form. An extensive interview of the literature and contextualizing of findings into Sackett's (1976) hypothesized model for predicting and explaining compliance with therapeutic regimens model focus the data analysis. Recommendations for nursing practice, education, and research are provided.

T1  - Concept Mapping as a Feminist Research Method: Examining the Community Response to Rape
AN  - 1883898728
AB  - A method used in program evaluation and public health research called concept mapping is examined in this article for its usefulness in feminist research. This method embodies several defining characteristics of feminist social science. Concept mapping is a single method that integrates qualitative and quantitative approaches, provides an opportunity for participants to work together as a group to develop an understanding of a concept, and places the participants in control of interpretation. Over the course of a six-step process, a group of people are assembled to discuss an issue or concept, moving toward a group understanding of that concept, which is then represented in a visual picture, or map. Concept mapping was used in the current study to examine how community resources for sexual-assault victims could be improved. A national random sample of 168 rape-victim advocates provided ideas as to how the legal, medical, and mental health systems could better serve victims. A subgroup of advocates then constructed and interpreted a concept map. The map suggested that rape victims still face many problems in seeking community help. Twelve clusters of broad-based and specific system changes were identified (e.g., fighting victim blaming, community education, sensitizing medical staff, legal reform). Implications for research on sexual assault and feminist research methodology are discussed.

T1  - Concept mapping: An instructional tool for learning economics and a research tool for determining students' understanding of economics
AN  - 304510643
AB  - This study evaluated the concept mapping learning strategy as an aid to the learning Of economics and explored the changing knowledge schemata of learners during a two-week course of instruction in economics. Although students using the concept mapping learning strategy did not show significantly greater scores on the economics posttest than those using guided reflective journaling, the pre- to post-test gain was significant for both the experimental and comparison groups, suggesting that all students learned economics during the class. Analysis of covariance suggested the major predictor of a student's post-test score was the pre-test score measuring prior knowledge of economics. It accounted for 30% of the variance indicating that prior knowledge of economics was an important variable contributing to the future learning of economics. Furthermore, the twenty-seven pre- and post-instruction concept maps created by the participants in the two-week economic education course provided a rich source of qualitative data on the students' process of learning economics.    It is suggested that concept mapping, though not proven effective as an instructional aid in this study, be tried in studies of longer duration or that use alternative forms of assessment to measure knowledge. Concept mapping is a useful tool for discovering students' prior knowledge of economics, observing developing understandings, and identifying misconceptions. These insights are valuable to curriculum planners and teachers. Although not specifically explored in this study, concept mapping has potential as an evaluation tool. The concept map provides a wealth of valuable information about the learning process and students' understandings.    Experts have developed standards for key economic concepts recommended for kindergarten through twelfth grade. This study suggests a need to further refine an organizing framework that recognizes the inter-relatedness of the key economic concepts. This organizing framework would move the focus of instruction toward relationships among and between concepts rather than on isolated bits of information. As students learn this connected-ness of knowledge they will be better able to apply the knowledge in various situations.

T1  - Charting the links between mathematics content and pedagogy concepts: Cartographies of cognition
AN  - 217660208
AB  - Links between content knowledge in the mathematics domain and in pedagogical reasoning were compared for university mathematicians, mathematicsmethods professors, high school teachers, middle school teachers, and elementary school teachers.

Because of their experience in both mathematical content and pedagogical concepts, mathematics-methods professors were expected to integrate those domains into a coherent pedagogical content-knowledge structure.

According to the recent literature on mathematics education, particularly on teaching mathematics, as individuals increase connections among mathematical ideas, they can do some or all of the following: (a) relate a given mathematical idea to a greater number or variety of contexts, (b) relate a given problem to a greater number of mathematical ideas implicit in it, or (c) construct relationships among the various mathematical ideas embedded in a problem (Lester et al., 1994; Schroeder & Lester, 1989).

Content concepts yielding the most discrepancies among groups were function (which occurred in 4 of the 7 significant links in Task 1), ordered pair (which occurred in 2 of the 7 significant links in Task 1), element (which occurred in I of the 7 significant links in Task 1), and binary operation (which occurred in I of the 7 significant links in Task 1).

[...]the content concepts showing discrepancies among groups of teachers as recognized in the word problems (Task 2) also were strongly represented in the significant findings based on concept maps (Task 1).

On Problems 5 and 8, the mathematics-methods professors, high school teachers, and elementary teachers proposed similar teaching strategies.

[...]the mathematics-methods professors, high school teachers, and elementary school teachers were in league on eight of the nine problems, and those groups plus the middle school teachers were consonant in their recommendations on six of the nine problems.

T1  - Concept mapping: How should it be introduced, and is there evidence for long term benefit?
AN  - 740330264
AB  - A naturalistic study, with two cycles of intervention, was carried out to investigate the effects of two methods of introducing concept mapping to students taking introductory subjects in genetics in an Australian university. Some of these students' views relating to concept mapping were also investigated in the years following its introduction. The results of this study suggest that the method of introduction can influence students' perception of concept mapping, and its potential benefit. Although most students taking introductory subjects had taken part in the project, and many had realised the benefits of concept mapping, retrospective views of students indicated that almost none had adopted it as a regular part of study strategies. This outcome raises several questions in regard to introducing learning tools to students and, in particular, the reasons for doing so.[PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]

T1  - An exploration of students' personal constructs: Implications for clinical teaching in psychiatric mental health nursing
AN  - 304422586
AB  - Despite revolutionary rhetoric in the nursing education literature calling for collaborative student centered learning, few opportunities actually exist, particularly in the psychiatric clinical teaching area, to include the voices of student nurses in the scholarly dialogue surrounding their learning. This thesis was designed to understand students' own ways of knowing during their six-week mental health practicums on acute hospital units. A constructivist conceptual perspective and George Kelly's personal construct psychology are the theoretical bases of the research. Qualitative methodology using the case study approach was used to describe the experiences of six Canadian second year nursing students from their own perspectives. Data sources included before and after repertory grids, a questionnaire and audiotape-recorded transcribed interviews. Content was theme analyzed, Vee Heuristic diagramed and concept mapped. The case studies were written collaboratively with students and member checking by correspondence six months after the practicum ended confirmed that the reports authentically narrated the personal construct changes which occurred, or did not occur, as a result of the course. The study spanned three years, included a pilot project and incorporated the resulting student "stories" into a clinical curriculum. The case reports are snapshot portrayals of how student nurses construed the professional activities they observed on hospital units which recently underwent organizational changes. They reflect human faces behind the paradigm shifts occurring in nursing education and health care. The following four overarching themes represent key findings. The research approach invited constructivist teaching. Students' anxiety related more to feeling unable to help than to mentally ill patients. Students felt a lack of inclusion in staff nurse groups. Non evaluated student-instructor discussion time was vitally important. Suggestions for clinical teaching strategies are made to assist instructors in the selection of experiences which can help link university curricula to hospital practicum sites. The research contributes to the conceptualization of how students learn nursing by re-valuing what they bring to clinical experiences, by increasing understanding of what students find engaging or difficult and by developing a pedagogical mode of inquiry which extends clinical instruction beyond demonstration and evaluation to creating a space for student perceptions.

T1  - Science Support: Physics
AN  - 2733149674
AB  - This is a resource book of activity sheets to photocopy. If you are faced with low ability pupils trying to achieve their potential at Key Stage 4, you can immediately integrate these into a work scheme. Nothing in this 108 page book is dressed up in fancy graphics or presented in contrived contexts - it is all straight physics with which the pupils are able to interact. So there is lots of labelling to sort out, ticker timer data to interpret and comprehensions where any limitations of literacy are minimized.  The author's advice on the use of these materials emphasizes that few instructions are provided on these pages because of the poor literacy skills of the intended users. It is assumed, for instance, that any points about safe practical work are best given verbally and not via the written page. These materials are intended for the reinforcement and repetition needed for learning and as such cannot be given `cold', i.e. without some preparation on the topic. The exception is the   linkword sheets (a sort of concept mapping) that could be used as diagnostic tools once pupils are familiar with the technique.  The alphabetically listed   word sheets are useful for revision, as spelling guides and/or for speaking the words out loud, and they work for students of any ability. (This reviewer did not know she had two 'pinnas' until reading the list for Waves and Radiation.) They are a great help for coordinating work with special needs/support teachers and for a quick check for gaps in the vocabulary of students not studying in their native language.  It was good to note that a Hertfordshire Science Teaching Scholarship provided the opportunity for the author to begin this work.

T1  - Issues in Adopting a Laserdisk-Based Science Curriculum
AN  - 2259581728
AB  - We examined the implementation of a laser-disk based science curriculum in an elementary school. The goal was to develop a richer understanding of the principles for designing a curriculum that will adequately support teachers in adopting a learner-centered framework. Issues included: who has ownership of the classroom discussion; what types of activities are engaged in terms of the constraints imposed; and what is the teacher's response to the specific tools provided (the teacher's guide, the Circle of Learning, and concept maps). In addition to looking at the implementation pattern, we also examined the impact of the implementation on student attitudes and anxiety toward science. Results indicated little adoption of the curriculum, and teachers continued to maintain a high degree of control in the classroom. However, results also indicated significant effects of the curriculum on science attitude and anxiety. Suggestions for future research are included.

T1  - Living with chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis
AN  - 304390107
AB  - Chronic pain is a pervasive problem, the prevalence of which is rising. The characteristics of chronic pain remain poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of living with chronic pain of rheumatoid arthritis. Twenty participants were recruited from rheumatology clinics, the Arthritis Association, and word of mouth. Using concept mapping, ninety-two statements describing living with chronic pain were grouped into seven themes. The themes were: the impact of pain; doing less because of pain; learning to live with pain; positive ways of coping with pain; negative feelings surrounding pain; family issues related to pain; health care issues related to pain. The greatest agreement among participants was for statements regarding learning to live with pain and positive ways of coping with pain; least agreement occurred with statements regarding negative emotions surrounding pain. Insight gained into the individual's perspective of living with chronic pain provides direction for assessment, treatment, and evaluation of chronic pain.

T1  - Clinical teaching: The development of expertise
AN  - 304325085
AB  - Clinical teaching suffers from the lack of a coherent theoretical base necessary to inform its practitioners. Research to date focusses primarily on the perceptions of faculty and students with regard to the characteristics of effective clinical teaching. Moreover, the characteristics of effective clinical teaching used in the research are generated from the researchers' assumptions of what constitutes effective clinical teaching. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the thinking of novice and expert clinical teachers in order to understand how clinical teachers conceptualize effective clinical teaching.    The conceptual framework chosen for the study was symbolic interactionism. The advantage of symbolic interactionism was that it provided a means of how understanding of effective clinical teaching was developed through interactions with others and with the self through reflection. Furthermore, it acknowledged the importance of cognitive activity and enabled the researcher to probe the thoughts of clinical teachers in order to understand the meaning of effective clinical teaching and how it was developed in the thinking of the study participants.    Five novice and five expert clinical teachers were interviewed three times by the researcher. In addition each of the participants recorded their thinking about effective clinical teaching in journals. Concept maps were developed for each of the participants delineating their thinking about effective clinical teaching and how that thinking had developed through their experiences.    Three themes emerged from the findings: (i) Learning Clinical Teaching, (ii) Practices of Clinical Teaching, and (iii) Knowing Students. The study uncovered similarities and differences in the conceptualization of effective clinical teaching by novice and expert clinical teachers. The centrality of the role of experience in the development of expertise in effective clinical teaching was revealed. Clinical teaching was perceived as a complex process, not well understood by novice clinical teachers. Novices were uncertain about their clinical teaching practices and described the overwhelming responsibility they felt for students and patients. The rich descriptions of expert clinical teachers of clinical teaching reflected their broad experiential base.    The findings of this study provide a beginning understanding of how novice and expert clinical teachers think about effective clinical teaching. Through the voices of the participants, a description of clinical teaching emerged. While the findings support what is known in the literature about effective clinical teaching, they conceptually link the characteristics of effective clinical teaching in a different configuration. Attributes of clinical teaching expertise add clarity to the existing literature. Furthermore, the study reveals other aspects of effective clinical teaching heretofore not identified.

T1  - Pharmacists' conceptions of social responsibility: An experienced/novice investigation
AN  - 304289085
AB  - As medicine becomes increasingly focused on the diversity of patients and the health care industry continues to evolve, the pharmacist must be aware of the issues concerned with the meaning of life, not simply the mechanics of life. The pharmacist is now involved in direct patient care and must be cognizant of the social, economic, political, and religious implications of medicine that daily affect their patients' lives. The principal objective of this study is to identify and analyze common and unique understandings of experienced and novice pharmacists as they relate to social responsibility and the pharmacist's role.    Research questions. (1) How aware are pharmacists of the ethical dilemmas of their practice? (2) What is the concept pharmacists have of social responsibility issues and the role of pharmacists? (3) What is the responsibility pharmacists feel toward their patients or society? (4) How did pharmacists construct their conception of social responsibility?    Research paradigm and methods. An experienced/novice dichotomy was selected for this study in order to examine the beliefs and conceptions of individuals who are expected to exhibit substantial differences in knowledge, curricular exposure, and perspectives toward social responsibility. The process of analyzing pharmacists' conceptions of their social responsibility incorporated three sequential qualitative tasks in which pharmacists wrote an essay on an ethical situation in medicine, constructed a concept map, and responded to a semistructured interview.    Conclusions. All pharmacists exhibited a concern for the appropriate use of medicinals in society and an understanding that their profession was an ethical enterprise. Experienced pharmacists (practicing more than 10 years) believed the authority in healthcare was the physician, therefore envisioning their role as a help-mate that is bound by legal constraints. Novices had a more personal conviction since they viewed themselves as an active member of a participatory team of healthcare professionals. Novices lacked a vision of the larger concepts of social responsibility while experienced pharmacists recognized the diversity of the patients they serve and the financial and political pressures on healthcare. In order to survive impending dynamic changes, pharmacists must reevaluate their definition of social responsibility and must not be limited by risk aversion, an expert's dominance, or the desire to be an inconspicuous assistant.

T1  - Using Tech Prep Principles to Improve Teacher Education
AN  - 2425005359
AB  - In response to the need for more active involvement by higher education in Tech Prep reforms, university researchers conducted four separate research and synthesis activities: (1) A synthesis of recent reforms in science, mathematics and English/language arts; (2) A survey of Tech Prep program administrators; (3) A focus group interview with Tech Prep teachers; and (4) An analysis of stakeholder perceptions of Tech Prep via concept mapping. Five major themes for teacher preparation emerged: (1) Teaching through application, (2) Student-centered/inquiry-based instruction, (3) vocational/academic integration, (4) collaboration and (5) real-world experience. Teacher education programs need to focus on developing these skills in prospective Tech Prep teachers. This entails making significant changes in the structure and delivery of teacher preparation, including interdisciplinary courses, requiring work experience of teacher candidates and modeling applications-based teaching methodologies.
Many so-called educational reforms have emerged over the past decade. Their genesis can usually be traced to A Nation at Risk ( National Commission on Excellence in Education, 1983 ), and they have taken on various forms: more stringent college entrance requirements, (which led to) heavier academic requirements for high school graduation, "back to basics," site-based management, outcome-based education, charter schools, schools-within-a-school, authentic assessment, and so on. One characteristic shared by most reforms is a concentration on secondary school education.
Likewise, several parallel reforms emerged from vocational/technical education, dating back to The Unfinished Agenda ( National Commission on Secondary Vocational Education, 1984 ). Many of these were based on the concept of "vocational/academic integration" and, like those in general education, took on various forms and were focused at the secondary level.
The emergence of "Tech Prep" galvanized integration activities by providing a substantive framework for implementation. An additional feature was the linking of secondary and postsecondary programs. Most activity, however, has again concentrated at the secondary level and the burden for development and implementation has fallen on high school teachers, counselors, and administrators ( Boesel, Rohn, & Diech, 1994 ; Bragg, Layton, & Hammons, 1994 ).
To many, Tech Prep appears to provide a realistic vehicle for broad, cross-disciplinary reform. It is therefore incumbent on educators at all levels to explore the potential for these reforms and, if there, to develop and support it. More specifically, teacher educators need to be aware of the salient aspects of Tech Prep and their potential impact on teacher preparation. The purpose of the research and synthesis activities described in this article was to identify needs and priorities for teacher preparation in a "Tech Prep" mode.

AB  - Students commencing an A-level revision course in physics were asked to draw a concept map for `energy'. Their subsequent comments on the task were generally very positive, and related to both their feelings about the work and their thoughts about their own learning. These important aspects of the student learning experience should not be ignored.

T1  - Effects of sequencing supplanted concept maps and generating concept maps on recall of structural knowledge presented in a CAI lesson for nursing students
AN  - 304138152
AB  - Concept maps have enhanced learning in a variety of settings, with diverse populations, and more recently with computer based instruction. An important question for instructional designers is whether the concept map can successfully be used within computer based instruction, and, if so, what are the most effective ways in which to use this strategy to facilitate learning? This experimental study asked if nursing students' use of concept maps supplied by the computer, either in advance of the lesson or following the lesson, would effect learning outcomes. In addition, the study asked if generating a concept map would influence learning. Additional variables of academic achievement and prior knowledge were assessed.    Two measurements of achievement on posttests were collected--immediately following the computer assisted lesson and one month later. On the immediate posttest, subjects in the control group scored higher than subjects in the post system supplanted treatment and the generated treatment groups. No significant differences on delayed posttest performance were found across the groups, although the control group was the only group to demonstrate a decline in performance. Repeated measures analysis of variance indicated a movement in the direction of significance of this finding.    Subjects with high academic ability did not appear to benefit from the concept mapping strategy in any of the treatment modalities. Prior experience among the control group may have influenced performance on the immediate posttest, but did not demonstrate the same effect on the delayed posttest. The influence of prior knowledge remains a significant factor in learning.    The present study indicated that concept mapping within a CAI lesson can produce measurable gains in achievement. Replication of the study is needed to contribute to the research base for effective use of the concept mapping strategy in CAI design.

T1  - Toward a national research agenda for occupational safety and risk-control management
AN  - 200355063; 00807577
AB  - The development of a model for building a research agenda in occupational safety and risk-control management is documented, and the results of its first application are presented.  Mail surveys were sent to select national panels of safety and health practitioners, who were chosen based on their leadership roles in key policy, regulatory, educational, and management environments.  From these surveys, 171 recommendations for researchable topics were produced.  These were narrowed down to the 98 most important topics by a panel of 26 American Society of Safety Engineers Management Division members.  A second survey was mailed to uncover any underlying framework or structure of the research recommendations.  Concept mapping techniques developed by Trochim were used to accomplish this analysis.  Panelists completed a final importance rating of the 98 items and sorted them into clusters containing similar items.  Rank order positions were determined using the median importance rating of all research statements sorted into a cluster.  This information provides a useful method for assessing the relative importance of the research statements.

T1  - PBS: An Economical Natural Language Query Interpreter
AN  - 216898205
AB  - A natural language interface, named PBS, to a biblio graphic information retrieval system, is described, which receives natural language search statements from an end-user and identifies search facets and implied Boolean logic operators. The program is in tended for use in conjunction with an intermedi ary program (OAK) for online database searching, operating in a user's personal computer. Such a program must be fast and make minimal demands on memory, which places severe restrictions on storage of dictionaries and thesauri needed for full natu ral language interpretation. This initial version deals with a single domain, bibliographic files, almost all of which use the same attributes, such as subject, author, or journal name. The objective of PBS is to identify terms in a natural language query, classify them by attribute, recognize the boolean logic stated or implied, conflate terms that have minor spelling variations, and present the terms to the intermediary program, organized by facet or term category. In testing, the main difficulty resulted from false identi fication of journal names. Yet, in light of the editorial capabilities of OAK, which allow a user to correct a query before it is given to an IRS, PBS can be regarded as a workable natural language interface that can alleviate some of the problems inherent in native command languages.

T1  - The effects of concept mapping on pre-nursing students' ability to recall physiological concepts
AN  - 304074835
AB  - The purpose of the study was to compare the effects of two instructional strategies on pre-nursing students' ability to recall physiological concepts. Two computer programs, one using paragraphs and concept maps and another using paragraphs and fill-in-the-blank questions, comprised the instructional strategies. Ausubel's Assimilation Learning Theory was used as the conceptual framework. The sample consisted of 46 pre-nursing students enrolled in an anatomy and physiology course.    A two-group, before-after, quasi-experimental design was used to study the hypotheses. Four intact course sections were randomly assigned to the control (fill-in-the-blank questions) or the experimental (concept mapping) group. The experimental group completed the computer assisted program that used paragraphs and interactive concept maps of specific physiological concepts about fluid volume. The control group completed the computer assisted program that covered the same concepts with paragraphs and fill-in-the-blank questions. The treatment was administered during the laboratory class periods. Both groups received a pretest, an immediate posttest, and a 6-week posttest.    Demographic data about the subjects was obtained by using a questionnaire. A 20-item multiple-choice test was administered as the pretest, immediate posttest, and 6-week posttest. Descriptive statistics including frequencies, percentages and means were used to describe the sample. The alpha level was set at.05 and the hypotheses were analyzed by using a two-way analysis of variance with repeated measures and an analysis of covariance. The analyses showed no significant differences between the treatment groups in the scores for either the immediate posttest or the 6-week posttest.    In this study, as a method for recalling physiological concepts, concept mapping was no more effective than reading paragraphs and filling in the blanks. Extraneous variables such as prior knowledge, learning styles, achievement motivation, and practice could have contributed to the nonsignificant results. The nonsignificant findings of this study contradicted previous research findings and could possibly be explained by the one-time implementation of the strategy, random assignment of intact classes, and the advanced level of the instruments.

T1  - The interrelationships of knowledge, context and clinical nursing practice
AN  - 304049524
AB  - This study employed an interpretivist methodology to describe and analyze the interrelationships between knowledge, context and clinical nursing practice.    The content of nursing continuing education programs offered 9-12 months previously was reviewed. Forty semi-structured, tape-recorded interviews were conducted with nurses from hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies to determine their use of this new knowledge. Nurses were asked questions about their learning, their work environment, and their clinical practice. Data were analyzed using computerized data coding, concept maps and matrices.    Nurses identified that knowledge became meaningful in clinical practice when it was relevant to the practice, met the needs of the client, and contained specific content that was deemed helpful. Additionally, the process of constructing a knowledge base was facilitated when the knowledge was reaffirmed, when the individual learner was revitalized, when confidence was increased, and when personal growth was sustained. Finally, nurses identified that knowledge became meaningful when they saw results, engaged in dialogue and networked with colleagues.    Nurses described the structural, political, symbolic and human relations frames of the context in which they worked as having an impact on how they constructed knowledge in clinical practice. The structural frame was seen as a hurdle to be overcome. The human relations frame was seen as positive and facilitating the construction of knowledge. The political frame was used as a screen to filter out new knowledge. Finally, the symbolic frame developed from the political issues in the organization and became imbedded as operating values and assumptions.    Clinical practice affected knowledge through the role that paradigm cases played in both personal and professional growth. Nurses learned to make meaning of such concepts as hope, control, vulnerability, acceptance, respect, loss, persistence, communication, caring, complexity, attachment and families through their clinical practice. Implications for nursing continuing educators, researchers and administrators were drawn.

T1  - The juggling act: An ethnographic analysis of clinical teaching in nursing education
AN  - 304020877
AB  - It is generally accepted that a practice experience is a crucial aspect of education for the professions. However, little research has been directed toward the basic analysis of clinical teaching behaviour. Much of what has been published in regard to clinical teaching is based on the authors' assumptions about the components of a clinical teacher's role. There has been a paucity of effort to identify these components within a specific conceptual framework. Consequently, clinical teachers in the professions have tended to teach as they were taught and the character of clinical education has remained relatively stagnant throughout the past few decades. His exploratory and descriptive qualitative research study was designed in order to develop a conceptual framework for understanding and explaining what takes place in the realm of clinical teaching in nursing education. The theory of symbolic interaction provided the theoretic orientation for the exploring the meaning and behaviour of six nursing educators in regard to clinical teaching. The research methods employed in the research study were selected in order to identify how the subjects explain reality in their own terms. An ethnographic epistemology, based on the social psychology framework of symbolic interaction, was utilized as a strategy for discovering the contextual reality of the clinical teachers' behaviour. The participants in the study were six clinical teachers in three schools of nursing; two diploma schools and one university generic baccalaureate program. Each of the participants in the study taught on medical-surgical wards in an urban hospital. The research entailed more than 1200 hours of participant observation, as well as interviewing, document analysis and concept mapping. Four major categories of teacher perspectives (i.e., values and beliefs) concerning clinical teaching were identified. A descriptive model of clinical teaching in Nursing Education emerged from the data by means of the constant comparative of data analysis. The Crystallization Model of Clinical teaching in Nursing Education portrays clinical teaching as a dynamic, interactional process in which what the teacher intends is mediated by a variety of contextual and mediating variables. Many of these variables are beyond the teacher's control. Consequently, the research participants generally viewed clinical teaching as a random activity which prohibited the planning for and the anticipation of specific learning events/situations. The essence of clinical teaching is identified in this model as the transmission of the practice of the profession; the presentation of a model of and for reality to students. The implications of the Crystallization Model in relation to curriculum reform, teacher preparation and future research are discussed in the research report.
